20667,watch as miyamoto sells you an iphone rather than his own company's dedicated handhelds
20733,some people just don't appreciate the perfect aryan form apparently.
20803,just my average saturday night bro
20856,but sometimes the joke is past commonsense and you don't want to give the wrong ideas.
20858,yeah the new meme is spam kappa in the chat
20970,do you not like server hoping in vineyards?
20983,self boosting obviously has no impact on the game.
20998,yeah fuck all the people just doing their jobs.
21005,"this is **not** the place to advertise a server (see rule 1), go to r/mcservers instead also great copycat of the **real** anarchy server"
21041,it's also possible they're working on a hev suit case.
21047,"well to be fair, aie2:kr was a hell of a game..."
21064,go code the game for valve and you sound like you can fix everything for them
21175,you warlocks are always complaining about something!
21303,wait what na is the only region in the world
21395,"yeah seriously, you can't expect a competitive environment when you play paid third party."
21397,"nah, they have to throw out those leftover oreos because they're stale."
21431,"quantum-atomic-theoretical physicist here, correct term is actually synchrony"
21487,i can't see this happening; they would need to win a whole **4** bo1s to do this!
21491,you could have published this as your own content in a youtube channel and monetized it.
21526,"yeah, causing a 1000 damage ability to deal 600 damage (ignoring resists) is nothing at all."
21546,"sorry, we at valve do not have the budget to afford proper sounds"
21575,yeah that's definitely what's important when deciding what skin to use
21594,"that's just subliminal forza 3 advertising, i'm sick of these ads microsoft!"
21634,"i mean **come on** it's been one month since the expansion dropped and no huge content patch has come out, it's ridiculous."
21672,"no don't you get it, it only counts when it fits the eu superiority narrative"
21680,no because the us is the only country that matters
21682,i think you mean one of the best pets in the game
21743,"yeah man, if korea got eliminated i'm sure they would be saying the same thing"
21773,"well, looks like it's not getting implemented then."
21806,i too miss reforging every piece of gear i have every time i got an upgrade to have optimal stat distribution...
21831,"yeah, when the ichors spawn, **push barrage**."
21897,"annie, vel'koz, karma and brand don't count, those are apc's in a low-income role, not supports."
21942,"oh thanks, i'm glad it's not as bad as it could be"
21973,"uptight*, you scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dickface."
21994,oh man this really makes me wanna drop console for the master race
22013,yeah tristana is clearly the better waifu!
22038,"of course, the human eye can't see past 24fps."
22112,the best thing you could have done was to post it here.
22131,"yeah man, i feel you, those ana potg's are so common, i couldn't get a potg as reinhardt in ages."
22143,don't want to damage your ore do you?
22171,"hikos calls are going to be as following, everyone walk out first and i'll kill the rest."
22194,"you're right, that was a jackdaw."
22233,[its ok dk's went in theirs to slaughter a bunch of em]
22238,yeah that's just a sign he's tilted all is good
22262,but zarya never gets play of the game.
22275,"if the title is in all caps, you know the video is good"
22281,yeah take a break from exposing political corruption harmful to the country to figure out why devs didnt deliver on a video game promise!
22362,"typical fucking game, appealing to the male fantasy."
22384,yeah honestly its a fucking shame that people in dia play for fun how can these ignorant assholes do that
22397,if your offer is still up im down
22406,see what you don't realize is they have no title and just baited you all into choosing one.
22422,"yeah that proven team that changed botlane to a, on paper, slight downgrade which caused them to completely collapse was the safe bet"
22427,"when our team lacks a tank, why wouldn't you pick a hanzo or a tracer?"
22434,true mlg hits the shot before touching the ground
22485,"i thought the power rankings were quite fair this year, obviously skt 1st edg/rox close 2nd and 3rd and then the next best team is obviously tsm."
22502,you guys are the type of person that gets confused when they add new deck slots lmao
22503,"yeah i hate how blizzard *forces* us to buy lootboxes, i wish we could earn them some other way"
22523,no girls allowed if you're a girl leave now seriously it's not safe here this is man talk
22643,none of the famous blizzard employees played wod at least.
22705,while we're at it lets have roadhog's hook prioritize squishies because his role is to pick off people.
22735,yes out of combat regen helps you so much late game :))
22755,"what u gus dont get it they lost to the team that lost to the champions so its still okay that they lost to ssg if ssg loses finals, hence in the end everyone at worlds performed great."
22789,yep they certainly shipped the game complete.
22794,"yeah i hate getting new maps and heroes for free, rather buy a season pass"
22868,"ikr i totally agree, they need to stop over-sexualizing roadhog and especially junkrat smh"
22938,"yeah because fuck those company who wants money, right?"
22944,makes me want to run out a buy it
23344,**prepare yourselves for...** [*another disappointment probably*]
23469,ew this copied call of duty run on walls customization first person shooter double jump
23621,"if you're not american, british, french, canadian, or australian, you're a goddamn commie."
23721,thanksgiving already passed moron
23951,booo i already own this game so this is shit
23998,no love for thanksgiving skins?
24071,you are not technically a weeb because shelter it's not anime
24073,yes that is totally what it is for
24096,pandering to girl gamers totally ruined the game.
24194,hey now zed with drakthar is pick or ban dont you know
24472,"im shocked they made a video during vacations, huge props for them"
24894,"great, because another offense hero is really what we needed..."
25109,but junkrat doesn't require any skill
25240,"actually gary johnson, didn't know i needed to use"
25482,"gotta make everyone's life easier, right?"
25483,but you are on reddit not youtube~
25520,"but some of the modding tools resemble morrowind modding, therefore the this is the morrowind engine..."
25571,saying kappa after a statement is sorta like a
25642,"yeah, because that looks super fun."
25737,"ffs blizzard, once again making the mistake of letting your fans test your new characters on the test server.."
26162,"that's an exploit that can get you banned, genji main btw"
26197,yeah why not give everyone the walljump
26218,scrubs are usually playing from 4pm to 7pm.
26393,*100% of the games have player to plant interactions this shows that people value them and they are core to the gameplay*
26426,"just go with smite and take green smite, it gives you option to do sick smite hook plays too and dusk blade tresh e max is op"
26994,"try to rinse the hard drive with water mixed with acid, it usually works."
27063,only if you queue for the support role and pick smite
27186,"because it looks super cool if you get potg and everyone will be like damn, that guy is so cool!"
27358,"ofc his ult cant move past player made terrain, it is coded as a minion and therefore has collision."
27526,"what a madman omg this guy got an iphone, what a moron"
27643,you only get them if you queue support thats how riot fixes supp being not chosen
27668,conan didn't like it so i don't like it
27710,"so they unknowingly agreed on that you shouldn't procreate, because you are that bad at cs?"
27831,"well yah its easy to do on console and pc, but in real life he wouldnt be able to do that at all."
27937,pretty sure f0rest is the greatest cs player of all time and every tournament he attends is automatically obliged to give him a mvp medal
27946,"well considering he's buying it for minors, it's fine."
27954,yeah i'm pretty excited about the prospects of pool nation fx 2 aswell
27955,we don't want you unless you remove that sticker.
27989,"placed in bronze, but honestly feel like i belong in grandmaster, so that's how i voted"
28022,"wow, what a significant and impactful fervor buff"
28101,"but what's more groundbreaking, medical care or a fake stage to practice on?"
28184,"i already own the tsm icon, i'll gladly take 250 rp as compensation."
28288,*cough* because there wasn't any major leaps and bounds in both software and hardware since hl2...
28322,this is essentially aim assist on console
28323,let's see how you feel about that if everyone in your team picks either dps or sniper lul because no one needs those meta tank or healer picks pretty overrated if you ask me
28427,ah right because the blatant lie about multiplayer and the outrage from the community about there being no multiplayer in it's final release are totally unrelated.
28430,only if the democrats run your city.
28505,just make everyone *promise* to use it responsibly
28557,oh cool another retro inspired indie game
28573,"oh yeah, wouldn't want him to mess up fnc's hot streak lately"
28587,i *wonder* what this is based on!
28633,oh look at mister i beat bloodborne over here
28715,"forgiven and febiven on the same team, jacob wolf strikes again"
28773,oh man i didn't know i had to press a button thanks for ruining the game might as well not even play.
28819,wait are you saying kt is the villian and skt is the hero how dare you
28830,isn't a danish a pop tarts ripoff?
28849,"finally, the urban champion themed strata coaster i've been waiting for!"
28869,"didn't get diamond because i lost promos 4 times in a little over a week, can confirm i'm totally not tilted ;) who wants that ugly icon anyway..."
28890,i too know my fair share of feminists
28999,yeah and maybe it will be as powerful as a $2000 gaming pc too
29029,next year the korean first seed might not lose to a wildcard team
29049,"um having no gender is a gender, it's called non binary you ignorant cis scum!"
29160,yea because kicking sneaky would be the worst thing to happen
29268,that's crazy i would expect the people in asia to speak english since that is their primary language.
29286,b-b-b-b-but he's the roast god.
29341,why else would you be against intrusive anticheats/ip bans/hwid bans?
29351,just slide your code over here i'll try it for you
29450,thats because they are all to busy doing world pvp outside kara
29494,"pretty impressive that naut only went 2/4/3 while mid was feeding, then."
29630,obviously they were picked up by some eu team
29645,"because rookie is a mid laner, duh!"
29652,"i mean, it happened with pre-ordering bad games."
29671,we should have a heartbeat monitor app on our computer as well that allows bpm to be displayed through the stattrack.
29702,my entire family was killed by a post-match thread so i report each one.
29761,yeah it's called custom games yo!
29829,"i'm not a racist, but fuck russians"
29856,"80 dmg is only 2 bf swords, no change at all"
29869,yes because it is very hard and exhausting to hold down the mousebutton at teammates.
29993,then dont get eliminated from the group stage
30109,racism won't be over until all whites are in chains or dead.
30113,"all their losses are on lan, fking onliners"
30175,hey stop being such a dingus boy-o im helping out my fellow riven players in a nice and fun environment devoid of salt and toxicity
30214,"yeah fuck j4, he has a knockup, a long range dash, a lockdown, a shield, a slow, %hp based attacks, armor shred, cc immunity, what were they thinking"
30372,not even riot cares about ranked teams
30529,that sounds no different than the mystery brawl.
30532,"don't burst the bubble man , it was definitely drama don't you see"
30556,don't generalize like that you fucking racist
30711,dude you can do absolutely anything you want and break any rules as long as you won the game
30721,"wait, what time is that eastern?"
30763,just play a hero which can carry.
31068,"because microsoft, sony, nintendo, and physical retail stores don't take a large cut of the sales."
31087,hmm 10s cd per charge and each wall last 10s this will make him not op at all
31104,"ah yes, zarya's shoot at the ground to run away quicker mobility, best escape"
31156,yea because no one is ever poor in my life.
31310,dont even post this shit here until you get 100 kills pleb.
31326,"yea, but how can play multiplayer games online without a monthly subscription fee?"
31338,"huh, wonder who's downvoting you"
31405,it's almost as if he's a business man who has to make tough decisions which some people might not like
31436,is that native for your crt monitor?
31479,"yeah, it sucks how no games have any unlockables anymore at all!"
31532,only _casual_ gamers don't want to get pizza grease all over their controllers.
31587,"of course, suramar is a waste of time... just ignore it!"
31588,"plz, you don't want to hang out with skankily dressed nelf and draenai in goldshire?"
31599,"easy, just sell the vr bundle and buy the console with the money and use the leftover cash to buy more taco bell."
31624,maybe that's what the price increase is going towards!
31628,i see valve's doing their best making the game as fun for everyone as possible
31631,oh man i'm excited for pikmin: zip- lash!
31659,yea everyone outside the us knows people in boston pronounce 'r' as ah.
31675,"being top 3 means nothing in your region, obviously"
31685,all owners are able to buy the dlc
31695,"wow, that fixes all the issues i brought up"
31759,i think we can all agree nuts n bolts is the best banjo game though.
31791,yeah but it'll be different this time!
31862,"pressed crouch after every shot, must be hacking"
31881,"it's there incase you forgot you lost, duh."
31899,"hey man, if a game is good but the devs don't cater to me it should fail because they're ruining the industry."
31919,is second place not good enough?
31925,how many youtube vids did you have to watch to achieve that?
31992,you know the counter is not to shoot her right?
32004,"but they improved to sometimes get a team out of groups, the gap's closing"
32192,yay he finally have less air mobility than pharah
32202,"seriously, why are there no good games anymore besides witcher 3?"
32248,"good thing it's such a unique pet- you need to tame a raid boss, so only hardcore mythic raiders who can sacrifice boss' loot have them!"
32281,"it doesn't matter how much damage we do to the earth, because god will take care of it when it comes time."
32320,to visit the official forums of course
32343,"wow, i wonder what type of computer weldon was using :00"
32372,"probably 18/0/12, less deaths more assists is the way to go"
32379,faker bjergsen expect
32427,save that for when tsm wins worlds
32455,i loved running through buildings with a skull over them frantically injecting my syringe into corpses with no fucking idea if it was the guy who was dead or not.
32456,"clearly a biased review, sponsored by amd."
32461,that's what you get for not multiboxing five of your class and maining the lucky one that got the legendary drop.
32491,"wow, with a explanation like that someone should definitely sue them for every cent they have."
32561,as your team dies in the background
32576,yeah apparently russia is such a shithole that they can't afford to play a free to play game
32651,that's a beautiful 1280x720 jpg
32654,because c9 has winning matchups in mid and bot i guess.
32675,so its almost as good as scorpio?
32684,"bitch, life alert cant save you from the body stealing shang tsung; he'll just rape your soul"
32719,"leblanc needs the mana, her laning phase is weak..."
32771,good or evil so like the us and russia?
32919,but how can it be balanced unless we have 10+ bans per team?
33006,hooks that never hooks someone is definitely good.
33068,*17 series wins and 1 series loss=tsm wins worlds without anyone contesting them*
33069,"ofc it did, it wasn't just booing"
33076,i think personal defensive cds are bullshit.
33103,aka the real reason he left c9.
33170,i'm sure if we cut taxes for wealthy ceos that the workers in their corporation will prosper too...
33269,"not anymore, he was removed in the last update."
33293,i am also sad hashinshin didn't make it to worlds
33331,someone might actually think you're serious without a
33369,they are all ripoffs of our lord and savior of games dead frontier
33383,"yes, acceleration is fine, pros can react accordingly and stuff."
33448,wow's community would never start a fuss over information that hasn't hit live servers!
33498,oh you poor americans and your poor 1 tb data cap
33519,and mei should reset ice block after every kill
33535,that's why i anyways sell them in stacks of one!
33536,"**wow**, making that text bold really makes me see your point."
33545,because keeping 2 different brews going with the same cooldown as well as making sure you actually pick up your healing spheres is the same difficulty as the rest of the tank classes for the same reward.
33578,"it's okay, he got cuvee with his ult."
33583,nah i sit on reddit all day and complain about something that costs 20 cents
33633,how dare you talk about our lord and savior like that?
33667,sneaky is such a hipster picking up every new adc instantly.
33798,you need to get the shoe legendary
33809,"yes, apple's app store is on it's last legs and yes"
33839,because it lets us know that valve's still making money on their game so they wont stop supporting it any time soon
33846,"n0thing, stewie2k, automatic, shroud, skadoodle."
33930,toxic players lose 27% more games and end up in bronze with you
34047,"yes pretty standard, i do this every other round"
34081,at least it's better than the 1000th momentincrime is 100% guyz
34117,"obama wasn't either, and look how he turned out."
34123,"duh, ofc 8 &lt; 64, you need 8x more !"
34127,but you can't kill what is already dead...
34133,tl;dr the hack dev bailed on them
34180,"of course it sucked, it's name was an acronym afterall, and almost all games fir acronyms for names are doomed to fail right from the very beginning."
34231,"how does it feel, being a helpful member of the community?"
34236,"dumb idea, overwatch is dominating the moba gaming market even though it's a fps"
34242,"i really doubt it, everyone on oldfnatic said krimz was a neutral guy perhaps he became emotional after the break up"
34258,"yea, because the ds series is sooo different in each release."
34277,i'm sure a total noob who was 30 levels behind you had all the idea of what you were doing to them.
34341,this is exactly why you're supposed to use
34360,i'm calling bullshit: at 2:30 in the video you claim to be making money via engineering; *everybody* knows that engineering is useless in legion and you can't make money off it.
34401,"nah man, i've gotta play that support fortune"
34412,but as a healer i should have been able to deal the same damage as a dpser.
34423,sarcasm is easily detected through text.
34425,because real gamers don't work duh!
34474,yeah i remember that last game where an obvious cheater played solo and the whole team actually kicked him instead of taking a free win
34489,"no ground pound, no jetpack boosts, no superhero abilities..."
34491,"difference is, hitler had the right idea"
34580,maybe eu will stop being so salty about riot not caring about them...
34589,how dare you not try your heart out in every single game you play in league.
34616,yeah that's totally not a false equivalency and is a great analogy
35119,"everyones forgetting the one and only dig god, corejj"
35813,i predict a new operation before the end of the year.
36386,then surely one more wont matter?
36846,you may have just be jabbing but i truly hate him with all of my soul and being so badly i can't see straight.
37459,"i don't have friends, i main hanzo."
37629,while we're at it lets make worlds only for koreans
37908,"yeah because my rank is totally a magic point system like on reddit and imgur, it has nothing to do with the caliber of players i will be forced to play with, nor the character of these players."
37972,but 2 winstons isn't cheesy at all
38058,i think the obvious solution to this problem is that blizzard should start announcing it in advance when they plan on tracking and banning botters.
38167,when did team fortress 2 get put on origin?
38199,why is n0thing working for dazed?
38282,"how does one become friends with the legend himself, brofresco ?"
38570,what an awesome life you have there
38586,cant tell if shit post or serious.
38722,"it's there to get you banned, what else?"
38723,"i started playing udyr support, at least this way i won't get banned."
38780,maybe then you'll have a friend
39026,"feature obviously, working as intended."
39049,you're right it's actually called his vape obviously.
39057,luckily its just a code to download inside so hes good
39119,just roll horde cos bloodlust is on page 1
39146,the human eye cant see above 30 anyways
39256,i just think that we need a new class called markswoman as some people may be offended that jinx is considered a marks*man* just because she has no boobs.
39320,maybe they can add the rest of the game on pro
39363,it's certainly not because of how he plays the game--it must be because thorin happens to say so...
39448,"yeah, but you wouldn't be that good on console."
39478,"riot says you should already have your friends in champion select, so having the friend list would be pointless."
39481,dude you don't understand all my friends are in gold now and i'm still in bronze because of the shitty dynamic queue
39523,how dare you imply a female isn't capable of such monstrous acts.
39555,if i was that hecarim i woulda flashed that
39559,"mercy might be better for cod players: her health regen is automatic, she does a surprising amount of damage, and when you get attacked and die, your team doesn't really care"
39780,im bronze so i cant tell you why empowered w is broken on rengar
39960,fingers crossed for battleborn 2!
39980,i suggest the fedora... it makes them panties drop...
40010,ooo i hope it's him playing the guitar raging about twitter!
40016,"im in g2, gold 2 that is, im too good got g2 esports"
40129,"yes, but it doesnt have 4k blu-ray, best games and cheaper price"
40306,i'm glad they got the foundation done.
40376,we should make a petition for them to announce the game as a ps exclusive so we then petition it to be on xbox
40398,their utility is switching to windwalker every now and then
40454,"he can miss healing by intentionally not healing, yup"
40460,"nah that's been out for ages, half life also runs on it!"
40487,yeah because that can't be manipulated at all lol
40523,"its the top one, because the bottom one has too much lens flare"
40544,no it's always my teammates fault!
40552,is battlefield 1 that shit so many people are giving it away?
40576,yeah cheaters would never do something like stream it.
40607,it looks like a ps3 master for sure though ^(when i view a highly compressed 720p youtube video on my phone)
40645,this explains why my jungler never come bot
40677,well damn maybe i should code cheats for esea to make hella cash
40706,yeah he should totally expect a bug that erase his eq.
40735,new meta: only downvoted bugs will get fixxed
40779,oh yeah because the guy who play once a week and who got his ass kick by a smurf will want to play again
40808,so na isn't an option as they already have too many imports lul
40862,"okay, let me just unplug my internet for the next 2 years."
40927,because women are weak and helpless and must always be protected
40957,listing very well organized points on the internet salty
41061,how about one that can see the whole map?
41078,"may probably (sadly) be [part of the attunement for the nighthold, since we see illidan there, and the quest in question has us getting soul fragments with which we could be able to locate illidan]"
41119,it's good for people who struggle to kite the camps since you can just complete the end of your first full clear whilst in your passive.
41291,if you don't get in game you can't lose!
41333,inside the game: smithzz -on a good day
41334,they do this to hide the overall lackluster chest armor design.
41391,or backup when subroza gets vacd
41425,only 6 year-olds play minecraft!!

90954,hit escape before you even cast to instantly grapple
90990,"hey man, he would be challenger if he wasn't always on an inferior team"
91009,"no, i think he means salt as in your anger/tears."
91037,not sure if faker's being the humble god again or

92478,definitely not enough green this expansion
92489,"it's obviously an upgrade compared to other mounts, so no."
92676,tsm third best team in the world
93697,why are people still preordering?
94067,he said he didn't want to sell his account
94131,"for my money, super mario sunshine is a pretty good game, but battlefield 1 blows it out of the water."

94958,"all i see is simple geometry, what's so special?"
95312,leaked operation background confirmed
95323,"but in the end, all you do is press buttons, and your life has no meaning..."

96613,"yea, meanwhile the devs of skyrim put absolutely *no* effort in it whatsoever"
96698,"if she is too attractive to sleep with you, she's a bitch."
96756,a team like splyce should pick him up seems really good
97111,youre wrong clearly this guys better than nintendo because he throws ripped models into ue4 like anyone else can and smacks on tooons of effects becausee graphics
97210,"honestly, striker lucian in one of the worst lucian skins in league"
97217,"yes, because my sjw senses will tell me to not shoot him."
97241,"nobody tell blizzard about that one 10 year old, had be illegal for him to play the game!"
97288,make plants smiteable for extra effects
97318,but isn't that what it's about?
97337,i thought vayne was a melee champ.
97368,the most important question is how projekt red can manage to have so many great and unique voice actors when they built the game in a 3rd world country.
97501,the fix is to kick the other guy before he has a chance to kick you.
97595,is there any other reason to propose?
97651,because everyone knows solo queue is played in the exact same way as competitive lcs lol.
97738,"sure, everyone absolutely adored fallout 4!"
97772,"my one friends name is kaoblast, and he's a super toxic rager, even mentioning his nickname can get you censored!"
97851,i was just tired of hearing about how his main spec doesn't have the hidden yet
97910,by that logic shroud is the best player in the world
98123,you just got outplayed by a better player.
98126,you're not allowed to joke about overwatch because overwatch is totally serious.
98145,"what is this, a picture for ants?"
98226,"yes, because my comment was very serious."
98376,yea tf and op didn't even put the game in the title!
98443,yes because now you have no adventures because theres no perks
98504,"because then i have to get up and walk over to the console, which is the worst part of my day."
98538,"wow, that's never happened before!"
98573,as long as those games drop cards they're fine
98688,because playing mm is torture but they forgot the r
98760,oh come on... k2v is where it's at
98767,good thing the observer caught the whole thing...
98811,only a true teemo main owns all of his skins.
98886,it's not griefing it's world pvp you signed up for it
98982,but c9 won't win anyway so it's ok
98991,so... fer being the next to leave sk confirmed!
99024,rework is already planned so nerfing is pointless.
99042,he understands the only way to beat huhi is with cheese.
99043,i can't even begin to imagine how many mousepads they are giving him.
99072,we will also have nvidia flying car works... right now it flying car doesn't works properly
99099,like they'll buy a champion they don't know about?
99100,then you can also look at porn your whole life instead of having real sex :) it's essentially the same experience
99144,"yeah, her old passive was super opressive and had too much power allocation"
99189,definitely way cheaper than the much higher instant damage from a single quick combo
99211,but ana is a better dps than healer anyways!
99213,you broke the rule your talking about.
99222,i don't know if you noticed but i'm a dps ana...
99236,ah yes it is totally intended that placing a zz'rot next to an inhibitor prevents minions that spawn from moving.this is just a clear usage of a feature.
99237,cause old yorick was so fun and interactive
99292,"no magic number 128 - litteraly unplayable, valve can't manage it's game"
99302,"lol there hasn't been a single patch yet since legion launched where frost mages haven't been buffed but we were *totally fine at launch* guys, trust us"
99478,what if somebody really meant a bundle of sticks and got banned for it?
99524,they should just hurry up and cut stewie already... it's bound to happen anyway
99569,"no, people that put things on the floor and then forget about them are horrible people and pigs and should be ashamed of themselves."
99583,people bash cod for releasing same game every year while in the mean time nintendo releases two pokemon games at the same time!
99603,"these weaknesses are the tax you get for soulstones, raid teleport, summons, and b res."
99700,these downgrades are starting to get ridiculous lol
99794,til fpl only consists of top tier players
99795,"no, becuase obviously your wrong and levels don't mean anything becauase this level 12 can beat that level 742"
99854,nope everything is a conspiracy... where is your tin foil hat sir?
99858,yeah and faker was boosted by bengi
99918,you mean thornmail first on kog isn't the best?
99922,because the players themselves can't possibly react to their teammate's play.
100023,"yeah well that's real nice and all but i doubt you could do that on a pc, peasant"
100042,"that's too easy, why not just ask on reddit?"
100113,it doesnt matter because master is the new diamond
100116,"yeah, people being afraid of a lethal weapon (made to look like a toy), what dumbasses"
100132,it's only 9 dollars and 32 cents to change your name in leage of lol
100143,no...all the top guilds just do it over and over all day long for fun and excitement...
100152,"yeah but he's not interested in those things, therefore that other person is obviously wasting their time."
100202,obviously that means the next expansion will include another old-world re vamp
100278,"they saved it for the major, that was the major qualifier"
100336,yeah imagine if mario had a love interest that they centered practically every mario game around...
100345,"that would be hook line and sinker, right?"
100354,"i hate giving women the right to choose, but i love killing babies."
100357,but koreans are emotionless robots!
100517,did marke lend him some hardwork.exe?
100605,"nope, ignore that, better live in our imaginary reality where fiddle is trash and should get buffs every week so that we can overreact some more"
100607,"oh no, the chances of a fictional character reciprocating my love are crushed!"
100682,"yeah, i loved those envy strats"
100751,you forgot to mention it was made by your gf which you met 10 years ago through wow while living in differents continents
100778,he was lagging only reason why moe won
100825,wow could the store entries for elite dangerous be more confusing?
100867,how does it feel getting the overwhelming feeling of looting a legendary multiplied x5?
100936,yeah cuz handing out elite titles to everyone and therefore watering down pvp rewards is totally the way to make pvp special again.
101048,basically half of the comments are insulting **baby** zombies.
101079,too bad the only g2 clips we see on this subreddit are of smithzz whiffing
101106,yeah because steel is such a good guy
101127,so is this battlefield 1 or mount and blade?
101150,i'd like some proof that jatt's statement isn't being made under duress.
101169,"lagged ... come on man, you're being blatant"
101185,well you're the one that doesn't follow reddits traditions by honoring the holy

101366,"shhh, don't let reality interfere with reddit."

102121,lol you got caught copying howtobasic
102134,ya i bet you've **never** made a mistake in your life either.
102177,you can't trust what the north americans say in interviews
102186,how in the world did you figure that out?
102202,oh yeah definitely a good lucio/zenyatta can carry a game with reinhardt dps and reaper snipers
102208,i think this gives an unfair advantage to astralis in the next ecs finale.
102219,looks good whens it coming out?
102228,b...but player-owned organizations
102242,"yes because sneaky has every team's passwords, account info, personal info and passports."
102383,but it's x god dosia... so we just unban ibp/epsilon and call it a deal?
102432,"oh sure, waiting 4 days to return to your class hall and click a few windows is far better than world quests."
102447,"yeah, having to do (correct me if i'm wrong), 4, 6 hour missions, then 5, 12 hour missions is so intriguing..."
102498,because of the low sensitivity players play with.
102513,also obviously riot probably paid him a very small sum of money right
102517,i think he just misses talon jungle sometimes
102523,"ultimate disc* get it right, shitlord"
102585,i must have missed that.totally not getting a pro now.
102588,something worrying trends
102606,your opinion tells me that you're probably not global.

103303,forgiven will win worlds and donate all the money to fix the greek economy.
103325,making an attempt to get better at a game is just stupid.
103346,and reddit is nothing like that...
103354,"hey man, flashing teammates just makes them work that much harder"

103897,yeah i rather have a hard drive than this epic game collection
103906,how dare eu be so lucky 4 out of 5 years

104070,"can't be the coach, dylan was the coach of the spring split!"
104100,"man, the only one out of the million reworks, til can't wait for that next rework"
104106,"nah, we are just the people who walked 15 miles uphill in the pouring rain to clear out summoning stones hours before the raid in the days before locks could summon safely inside the instance."
104119,"yeah, every game should be the witcher 3 from now on otherwise, they're objectively bad games all of them"
104265,"no, summoners got removed from the lore"
104971,"it was always in the game, just at an occurrence rate which made it statistically impossible to get in any reasonable time, it's completely untrue to say it's only just been hotfixed in when it was technically available all along."
105315,so thats what phantomlord has been up to
105413,"but we're the only people on the internet right, no one else sees this when it's on the front page or anything."
105504,stfu if you haven't seen peke kite with sivir

107560,"i can't blame my completely perfect candidate for her failings, fuck you!"
107620,that's his excuse for it anyways.
107677,"ugh widowmaker is useless, play something meta"
107830,yes everyone who's ever left a game when it says final score is an idiot.
107895,haven't heard this every preseason since the beginning of time.
107939,no everyone knows the only reason anyone makes posts is to hoard karma
107957,yeah this delay of a mechanically simple run and gun is making galaxy scale promises that it will completely fail to keep and result in widespread refunds and false advertising lawsuits.
107960,but dom said he felt pretty weak
107997,obviously you are being toxic and should be banned

108805,no way would they do a deal on gta v.
108821,"ugh, its like mg+ is just aimbotting"
108870,"because as we know, losses in bgs are always the fault of individual players."
108989,yes because not allowing cheaters to play is so short sighted.
108990,yes because that has never been a bad thing
109001,i don't see why this doesn't make sense
109162,"nah, i prefer the ***other*** punchline."
109187,in the mean time your teammates all still died so you failed at being support
109377,that happens to me every night irl... i'm so lonely...
109442,he's so impatient that he got a copy of overwatch **alpha** in response of blizzard's gratitude of him screwing end of the line.

111991,"i'm sure you play multiple hours a week and commit to this game because you want a border and a victorious skin, it sounds very legit and reasonnable!"
112032,but look at rush he's so good at adc
112058,the technology just isnt there yet

112818,it takes riot too much money and time when they can be spending their time making skins
112886,"yeah, it was totally his own fault that he was enslaved and made a gladiator."
112930,breath of the wild is a sequel to link's awakening confirmed!
112933,the reason it looks like a single image is because your eyes cant see beyond 30fps
112955,but what if they have implanted a chip under their skin which informs the player his enemies exact coordinates by vibrating in morse code?
112986,yeah but it doesn't matter because only pussies try to win no matter what
113034,"cause svenskeren got banned and alliance got kabumed, and because tsm took a game off of samsung white"
113059,our cheats aren't working the same anymore what gives?

113342,no you are seriously the first person in the history of this game to ever want this.
113377,or just sandbagging so imt dun get to worlds
113378,"yeah, but the leavers are always (100%) on my team!"

114336,basically the only plot of destiny.
114421,"yeah, the hype has been dead a long time ago, there's only 5-10 post a day about sombra now, nobody remember her, and nobody care anymore"
114477,yeah man people trying to communicate and encourage team play are the worst
114479,the game is not using vulkan because of consoles so it is not an easy port
114485,make the most of it asap ... games dying
114488,personal cheats finally got updated to the latest version
114507,"much like griffith, healers do nothing wrong."
114548,"yeah, totally, i'm so glad they gave out useful and relevant information that everyone has been asking for re legendary drops, whenever i have a question with evidence and i write it well, they totally respond and don't stay fukkin silent on the entire fukkin matter, despite many players losing a lot of faith in them..."
114691,bu-but sjws and tumblerinas are the sensitive ones that are always getting triggered and need their safe spaces!
114705,gets rekt by just one magic pet
114914,no you're just selfish you need to suck her dick first

114978,sorry the technology just isn't there yet.
115099,"yeah, since marin proved to be so good in teams with non-korean communication."
115139,germany must hate jews based on what hitler did.
115140,tsm obviously the best western team ever
115142,"he wasn't wearing any headphones, that's why."
115193,nah there's no difference in between being confident that your team can perform and saying your team is flat out top 4 in the world eventhough the west never beat koreans in bo5.
115223,"german, wallbang and 360, for sure cheats..."
115231,"yes, i'm sure they could not have modified the amomentincrime site to make it so the date and time it completed at was on blizzcon"

115266,wizards of the coast copyright crew inc
115267,"solo queue is coming back, they totally delivered!"
115272,"but remember, i'm stuck in gold because my teammates are bad"
115286,pretty sure some folks from the weapons and military division got transfered to mobile and home appliances for watching porn at work
115298,it's obviously sombra hacking the servers
115333,supports are surprisingly underappreciated
115344,now you see what happens when you forget to put a
115387,"people are just assholes, i guess they want real explosions to blow them away, these people put so much effort to create something different and creative but i guess having a cool voice and saying na vi lg g2... makes it better than this"
115388,it would overwhelm new players to see how fast they are
115605,"cmon, everyone knows that major changes in the game doesn't automatically mean any code was changed."
115631,yet its fine on xbox... yea totally bethesda's fault.
115636,"what, wouldn't you want some of that divine ass?"
115676,i'm sure this community will play this over the core mode
115715,so we can write skt names in it of course!
116668,oh boy i hope this game has micro transactions!
116711,"throw in a winston shield and some kind of genji deflect ability too, that'll make him almost underpowered but at least viable."
117132,"yeah he did, it just says defeat at the top for shits and giggles"
117322,how will they know that i fucked their mom though?
117332,"just what i wanted, crit mastery"
117334,only pussies try to win no matter what
117486,i believe that is what we call a support player
117511,"deft, so biofrost can play roaming alistar or some shit, because deft will easily handly every 1v2 botlane in na"
117621,way to actually answer the question!
117818,"so we have finally reached the point where you actually pay to play each individual level (i don't care how big they are, its the same setting/level) can't wait to pay for each gun besides the starting pistol"
117935,"probably wont, but hey, sleep is for the weak"

118624,good thing i sold my ps4 last month to pay rent
118777,"sure, its not like this is an issue that dl is notorious for in the past or anything"
118841,people would never know if dosia is just nervous or just chilling though
119282,"oh yeah because google will provide suggestions universally, every single person querying for how to see enemies will get this recommendation"
119410,"yeah, how silly of them, to think a *girl* could understand an additional paragraph of lore"
119457,if something makes me feel my feels its cringe duh!
119472,yes rain would leave faze with what he's making for boosting them
119573,naw man you can just dash forward to get in auto range
119594,obviously we should just be hand picking matches and groups to make it the most likely to have all the same teams at every major without allowing other teams to show what they can do
119598,"please no, this will just encourage camping and hunting the supports who place them so the team will never have wards on the map"
119630,i used a bot to get all spec legs and tuen got banned so theres that
119641,"apparently yes, he's the biggest fucking coward in all of alliance history."
119706,can we just find a way to compare this to steep pls?
119790,yeah totally it's like an identical scenario.
120016,yes because in last clip he surely was out of position being inside circle of 4 teammates
120072,"lmfao the bias in this thread is unreal, i cant even tell if some of this stuff needs an"
120246,double negatives are almost as hard to understand as sarcastic comments on the internet
120341,just buy a rylais for her burnout
120447,the rest of my team is garbage and i obivously was the carry with my sick hanzo plays.
120606,"announcers tongue moves right at the beginning, sloppy as hell"

120755,can't see flairs on mobile :( well you main shaco i downvoted you
120762,"yeah, it's common to beta a product and then change it entirely upon release.."
120786,oh thank goodness no one has stolen this one yet!
120807,maybe people would notice this more if they ever actually stood on it...
120913,basically confirms why reignover left immortals
120940,"dividing the player base on every server, sounds like a good idea"
120981,no guys there's no proof there is a soft cap
120984,yea 10 posts over 2 months was very annoying
121007,this is the main reason why gen 6 is the worst
121080,excuse me while i do my calculations for the next time i will randomly lose connection or my whole street/town will lose power that way i can play quick play or arcade so when this does happen (because it will i am 100% sure) my team won't be royally fuckt.
121319,but it's perfectly fine to kill wolves in the next xpac as they are obviously much more powerful then archimonde
121535,wouldnt really call it a monsterplay.. more like insane play
121571,but monies dont grow on trees you pleb
121603,yeah spending 6 months in a room alone on an entire floor not being able to talk to your team while you develop one of the biggest games of all time really isn't that bad.
121681,because he's watching it on his superior xbox one.
121686,nothing wrong with a bit delayed abortion
121791,"but ghost helps me run it down mid, faster :^)"
121813,"just cuz ur butt hurt that u got killed doesn't mean i'm hacking, grow up"
121917,he needs to feel the hard slap of a stewie high-five after every kill or else his self-esteem bottoms out and he plays like garbage.
122089,"i mean gorilla was a top tier support for 3 years straight with a slight dip in the middle of 2016, fuck that overrated guy"
122130,"those get so much done, don't they?"
122135,is this what happens when you mess up travel form?
122173,"wtf dude, that's 100% accuracy plus the rez and healing looked like snapping, obvious aimbot"
122192,"tsm is a strong team, whether i join them or not"
122210,you should be banned for exploiting

122333,"yes its much more important to fix mages, no time for warlocks and their silly qq"
122394,"yeah dude, screw riot for not balancing a gamemode meant for fun in the name of competitive integrity."
122437,yes lets make it sound like the original plans were all good.
122456,"when i was his age, my mom used to use extension cords to beat us kids with, thats if the hot curling iron was out of reach."
122479,that's why tsm brought wt back as the adc?
122486,"harder said then done, why is my team so tryhard in comp?"
122518,everyone should have a 1.5 rating minimum
122559,using the wow equivalent of a nuke on a town full of people screams good guy to me too!
122683,"no, cd's need to go the way of the 3.5 mm audio jack and the vhs"
122935,no you need to be angry and you must demand a response from blizzard
122973,"omg a company actually charging money, cmon nintendo sell this for free so you remain in debt!"
122999,this kid deserves a better team
123012,"yes, that is exactly the statement i was trying to make."
123051,im sick and tired of you qtpie sheeps.
123057,never heard of bf1 but appearantly its this small indie game about ww1 made my 4 dudes from sweden.

123169,good that poe roams a lot and help other lanes.
123280,wouldn't say maokai is all that sexy
123284,cashiers have absolutely no reason to exxagerate about the crap they sell you.
123324,"he was obviously using his ult, you're just bad :d"
123373,darksouls that should get him out of your hair
123378,"don't need a healer, just someone who can battle ress."
123382,because the draugr puzzles are so clever and challenging
123436,"shame on you op, prodigious would have been a much more fitting title"
123456,obviously ssumday is planning on getting a basketball pro after his lol career!
123507,well michael santana and christian rivera
123599,"yeah, it couldn't possibly have been the traffic from the steam sale going on."
123614,but rank doesn't matter if you get shitters it must also mean you are shitter
123616,watch out she gone when you run out of credits
123637,"seriously, you should propose to the woman who won't consider spending her life with you unless you spend an exorbitant amount of money on a blood diamond torn from the earth by slave labor and price-gouged by anti-competitive capitalists."
123639,clearly fake since that riven is always on the opposite team
123671,no after dota2 release and patch 7.00
123680,"it's not a performance issue, it's a feature."
123733,yeah dude dekay legit only follows yee_lmao on twitter and just waits for him to post stuff then writes articles on it.
123772,so you just postet this crap to provoke... good thread!
123781,go try nonprime there is literally no difference
123789,because it's a great environment for me to teach my yasuo mechanics to level 1's.
123877,yeah the picture of the helicopter with the umbrella logo doesn't mean it's resident evil at all
124068,that feel when someone climbs higher than you in 4 minutes than you can in 4 weeks.
124072,"m0e making bad decision and throwing is awp instead of throwing is tec-9 result as blaming the other one... nice, i love this guys"
124121,man... never thought of typing that in the chat myself... crazy.
124154,this just in: creepers are older than the pocket edition fanbase.
124161,well.. that's probably because legion has only been out for like 3 days now.
124225,"no, that's the robot in the game"
124293,"impossible, obviously sylvannas is the most evil this ever and everything she's ever done or will do is through absolute evil and she cares about nothing but evil."
124297,are there any anti cheat at this shit tourney
124316,yeah that sounds like amazing fun past the first 5 minutes
124321,"it's like saying ahri's e shouldn't interrupt dashes because it's a bug, not a feature since release."
124412,"mountains and caves, always my favourite!"
124416,"hey, at least you knew everyone's name who worked there!"
124426,oh so that's how varian died then?
124441,should have taken the offer from faze to play top tier cs
124463,valve need to change the sounds guns make when they hit the ground
124464,are you telling me that bunny riven cosplayer is a guy?
124561,"yeah, 4 obliterums per item is a piece of cake"
124575,i'm just mad that they're taking out the headphone jack
124623,i'd gladly trade my friends for a grand master rank
124651,"this has to be fake, ana potg's don't exist"
124656,"come on, who actually uses audio jacks anyways."
124684,"no way man if you prefer anything that isnt current year, then its nostalgia."
124702,but sneaky saying welcome to my butthole over and over is the funniest thing ever!
124738,"so you've seen all the rpgs that will ever be created and that's how you came to this conclusion, right?"
124762,"dude doublelift is asian and bjerg is white, it's obvious who's the american"
124764,riot is an indie company and they need to save the money for big events ...
124770,cause riot is a small time company without unlimited funds
124840,but the ps4 is for the players!
125057,i can assure you it was a quiet day
125103,"if i can't play duck hunt in a crowded mall, what's the point of ar then?"
125111,"as we can clearly see, c9 can only lose finals when the other team cheats"
125112,you should report him for harassing you and spending your cash...
125131,"what's he need an air cooler for, the whole board is in the open."
125227,there are legendaries in this game?
125266,damn its almost like every ult is different and has different cons.
125350,"maybe he wasn't trolling, but just trying to stop you from trickling back into the fight!"
125377,because bigger numbers are obviously better
125394,yeah they totally represent the entirety of the pc gaming community!
125499,that's the next fcc chairman you're talking about.
125532,"considering i've dashed off the map multiple times, i am definitely seagull level."
125551,why can't we get another generic sounding radio song like warriors?
125634,pawn is subbing i think but we still got deft
125662,because that's sooo important
125727,that's what you get for being friendly :p
125737,"actually when they started losing, they banned asol and started over"
125739,"yeah because what i said is that the one game proves na is on another level of macro, i didn't claim it as evidence, you're right."
125840,you got to love all those free themes and miitomo clothes
125846,"4 viewers makes me a better player than you obviously, it's 5 against 1"
125880,i mean he just moved his mouse..
125902,that's why edg and tsm both lost their first game
125911,no don't you understand the magazine itself is blizzard lying like they always do the whole media system is rigged guys
125921,vengeance dh should be on this list
125926,yeah i'm not supporting a team that can't even synchronize their bm.
125939,"eating a burger... 5 guys... 5 guys, burgers... nice try ad department... haha"
125982,because they definitely looked good enough last week to 2-0 clg and anx
125991,"if they ban the champs they want, how will they pick them?"
126014,idk man that r8 update last year was pretty hype
126073,league is dead.. nothing to see here
126087,"so glad they are buffing invulnerability, because that's so fun to play against!"
126096,he forgot to clarify that his soloqueue teams look up to g2.
126102,"but mata/uzi were able to beat tsm's bot lane, since tsm is the team in the world that must mean mata/uzi are the bot"
126105,"g2 has it, lost forever in a wildcard region"
126111,that's what happens when you forget to press your aimlock key
126148,"no man, when eu say it's okay, when americans say it, we're imperialistic pigdogs wishing to curb the freedoms of every cheese eating wine drinking socialist from portugal to eastern russia."
126188,"because at this point everyone, including alts, should be 850+ and have mastered their class!"
126204,what and you're saying that doesn't happen in real life?
126214,i mean we wouldnt be pc gamers if we didnt bitch about every little thing that doesnt go our way...
126221,right next to qt casting the bot lane with gosu
126234,"yes, lets just ignore the dozens of buffs gnar received, he has always been amazing!"
126267,"no, we were right about stew being the worst thing to ever happen to cloud 9, we'll be right about this kid!"
126286,"yea, don't you know, it's bad game design (read: impatience) for them to not give us every item in the first 2 months."
126290,"yeah man, huni, yellowstar and reignover left fnatic's giant pay to find a challenge in na at lower pay."
126291,it's ok as long as you do it for allah
126311,mata is just misunderstood.. he's training uzi's reaction time
126324,yeah what a fucking dick trying to help clarify things
126371,on xbone you also get the benefit of hdr and cinematic 30fps.
126381,is that why face it is so cheater free?
126467,redditor who posted this is probably a worthy example of fitness and lifestyle who wanted us to be aware of wolf's shortcoming
126471,but it is always shaco's fault...
126498,i'm sure a lot of writing effort went into an optional dialog option
126559,red dead redemption: hd remaster confirmed.
126565,that's a *hog* not a swine you uneducated baboon
126590,i dunno man it seems like it be a lot of stupid farming heroic dungeons all day when i'm already geared way past it
126602,that was already the last operation's name
126609,"lol cuz businesses dont run on consumers, my bad."
126613,what else is there besides the us?
126626,"yeah, that is exactly the reason."
126670,wow omg i love the particles on a champ i'm never going to play omg hype.
126752,they already did- no toaster mode.
126879,"azir also makes a good support because he has a mobile ward, constant slows, good damage and a game changing knock away."
126885,because it's such a great business decision to just sell one product.
126900,are you the 40 year old virgin?
126913,"no one ask them to throw money at bugs of cause, but hire more people definitely helps."
126929,nah man bang aint gonna choke in the finals
126957,yeah it's totally sony's fault that bethesda has yet again shat the bed when it comes to developing on playstation.
126974,no i think you are the only person who holds that particular opinion
126980,but there wasn't even any bowling :(
126997,it's almost as if blizzard puts more love into their human models than the other races...hmm...
126998,i believe he can use it as a grappling hook as well.
127017,floor tanks require zero heals.
127158,blame twitch for not having a custom full round clipping feature
127173,"but hey, at least they added the parallax effect to the loading screen for iphones!"
128227,damn that is quite unfortunate that we can't see above 4 fps
128596,nasus's biggest counter is a jungler
128791,"nah metacritic doesnt reflect game quality at all, not even a little bit, in fact i think its negatively related to quality, i dont trust reviews, reviews are rigged, i dont trust anyone about a game but also dont want to try it therefore its bad and everybody is annoying and cringey for telling me that its good, i cant believe this shit"
129855,"yo dawg, i'ma let metroid prime finish, but other m was the best game in history."
130086,we already had those 3 days of everyone being sombra pls no
130237,don't worry free dlc will fix that
130251,so someone can just get a different passport and it's fine with valve?
130497,"just like how jigglypuff's rest fully restores his health, oh wait."
130749,this is why godsent dropped out
130860,i mean i thought oh no now all the pro players are gonna get vac'd rip pro csgo cause this new anti cheat is bad
130919,get out of here with that correct logic.
131237,punish yourself to prove a point - good move
131254,"but hes french, he cant understand the casters"
131311,how unprofessional of the casters to mocking rl like that!
131313,dude this thread title is an offense pls drop it
131319,we all know that it was yellowstar's brilliant leadership that carried fnatic s5 huni more like whoni
131348,"well, yeah, this is huge; it's a potg where bastion is not in turret form or ulting for once."
131357,did you just assume the seed's orientation?
131539,i'm guessing a support or tank since no one plans to play those characters.
131569,these kids don't even know the konami code
131660,"this is just a really big bump, don't worry."
131704,when we gonna start seeing the new doom on mobile?
131751,did we forget how weak and useless adcs are and that the class needs hard buffs?
131776,"he just disconnected, he'll be right back."
131802,you're not satisfied with ivern?
132017,"i don't get the big deal, none left the game."
132052,seems like a pretty significant downgrade.
132342,i was carrying games as dva *before* she was good!
132534,still more accurate than console shooting
132542,how did they removed something that wasn't there in the first place
132559,54% wr with 0.8%(or sth) playrate was just too much
132695,"we use to have one here, it was called the australian classification board."
133151,you mean butthole jokes are not cool anymore?
133177,"if he wants a veteran support then bring xpecial, i'm sure the xpecial and piglet bot lane would be great!"
133196,til: a korean professional gamer isn't a 6'11 black man
133328,is this the first week that gta v is not on sale since it was released for next gen?
133344,"so what you're saying is if i play adc evelynn and do well, i can get an easy s?"
133359,man riven r is fucking hard to hit
133441,"my roommates uncles cousin works for sony, i can totally help."
133455,"nah guys, they fixed some other bug, they don't deserve the hate"
133486,um obvs korean is better at everything videogame
133526,"sakura space, it teaches you how to talk to girls"
133566,"you're right, naughty dog should just make this gta with zombies."
133577,response bias with genders... need more options not everyone identifies with only male and female its 2k16
133581,naf with the +33 in the series mixwell with the +4 definitely man mixwell carried those na scrubs
133598,koreans are robots with no personality.
133622,"yeah, a lot of movies with that plot line."
133769,"can i say the zelda cdi games, or are they just straight up fucking terrible?"
133876,because policy can never change.
133909,rito is just falsifying their numbers to make it look better
133921,i thought the next update was going to be the slab and stairs update?
133969,think above the odds next time and you'll understand it
133999,"yeah, and he'll do very well at worlds... just like he did this year..."
134028,but people should be smarter and know from whom the redemption is used from
134054,yeah ro rengar was the real carry there
134202,i'm a terrible ryze so he needs buffs
134222,twitch name is pranksterzelite man i wonder what his reddit account is called
134224,nope should be arrested the burned at the stake like the dirty cheat he is
134232,"fuck you, i wont share with you."
134260,"wow, didn't realize the korean race was so superior"
134262,yeah cause you're obviously going to own up to it right?
134279,"damn, sucks when the way you play with a controller is the reason it's broken inside the retail box"
134293,"verticle video, 0/10, seriously man"
134339,"aatrox, i mean... how am i supposed to know what its abilities are"
134356,"what, you don't play every single one of your games to 100% completion, finding each and every single easter egg, including going through all the lines of code?"
134365,man this game is looking better and better each day!
134466,weird that it's all themed around a single console from the '90s
134513,are you implying connecting to a game of league is not life or death?
134567,it's not his fault that his team sucks.
134680,"one of the most skillful things you can do in cs:go, along with jumping and spinning around at the same time whilst also using the mushroom hat ct model, all skill no luck, rng doesn't exist"
134727,yeah it's way more impressive doing it in normals during the 40 minute lane phase.
134742,if you're not losing but still getting the potg then you're playing mercy wrong.
134745,oh look here's that one person in every thread that can't spot sarcasm without
134781,"what you said may be true, and i don't personally engage in world pvp, but it would never upset me if alliance are getting ganked, because they're all dicks."
134804,he shouldn't even be trying to get his steam account back... doesn't he know that only pussies try to win no matter what?
134805,"zone so big, almost feels like some race should start there and spend more than 10 levels with a fully fleshed story about the turtle and the people living in there, weird how only now players like op find this right?"
134809,good thing there's reasonable replacement rules
134823,why the hell does some champion like zed have energy but some champions like lux have mana?
134873,skt can only win wolds by buying good koreans
134939,"nah fam, bjerg would be an na import now,eu needs bjerg"
134970,they have already done a healer only brawl though
135015,.. but the question is: did you really?
135087,"so... torbjorn players in general, right?"
135188,why is there some sort of sale?
135215,"the way sombra's teleport works caused a weird hook thing, so roadhog's hook must be broken!"
135230,downvote for misleading summoner name
135327,how can they be anti-gay if they mention in every post how they have nothing against gay people?
135381,"nah, that's just a general toronto attitude"
135392,woah whaaattt i didnt know that
135484,but f2p mobile gaming is the future!
135513,so... do we put these pitchforks down now or...?
135575,yea tanks do very well against % hp and true dmg
135610,"so you reply without thinking or reading what it is going on, that's so much better."
135680,i'd love to 200% other follower ilvl upgrades
135821,didn't hear that but to be fair i play in spanish so i'm used to reaper teleporting and shooting in spanish y'know...
135846,because girls don't play games!
135919,did you build maw to survive that skillfull and totally balanced ability or were you playing the juggernaut kog'maw comp for fun to make adc seem like a normal champ in s7?
135921,the weight of pawn's last team really took a toll on him.
135982,because you haven't gotten the achievements yet
135984,"yeah, what if coldzera got bought it out by faze in place of rain because he's going to fnatic in place of wenton"
136012,perhaps he should share his cheats with shoowtime instead :d
136021,thats what he gets for camping spawn!
136062,"yeah, but it's english grunting."
136090,not like he builds any items which help with kiting though
136105,he was probably just alt tabbed out while defusing.
136235,yea its also bogus that skt can be paired with top teams in the world too.
136293,nah dude i love being drop attacked by reaper 6 times in the final push
136296,obviously he wasnt wearing his headphones
136329,"its on the mapper side, valve is too big of a company to hire a guy to fix some stairs"
136351,xbox has 100% uptime and i demand the same from ps4!
136361,hard to be ddos'd by 12 year olds.
136368,so great we can get a discussion going in here
136415,"now those linux people can play the game they bought, curses!"
136557,our feelings are more important than a business' profits!
136588,this is what you get for wanting a greater view distance!
136639,i think you underestimate how rigged it is
136640,"yea, eu sucks so hard that regi was definitely flat out lying if he said eu teams would make it out of group"
136682,yes because rhonin overcame that mana bomb sooo easily
136695,"woah, skyrim remastered is coming out on android?"
136731,valve started to listen to people's complaints about their toasters not handling the game
136769,this is great because my followers having a higher gear score than me was my favorite part of warlords of dreanor.
136774,we need more cosplay posts in this sub
136801,"yeah, never happened before, like msi last year."
136836,i can't wait to play as malfurion
136944,i guess contracted work isn't considered working for someone.
136989,"3-3.5 paragraphs for all other regions, 6 paragraphs for eu... definitely didn't see that coming"
136995,i bet you don't play ekko either.
136999,"no man, valve get everything right the second time, and there has never been an update where they fucked up."
137003,"just like fifa tells all the fans at football matches to stop yelling at the players, because they get distracted."
137057,"that's only slightly longer ago, and possibly slightly less relevant?"
137078,losing to the number 2 and 4 teams in the world = shit
137094,"i can... i just need his email address, password, ssn, dob, and name just to be safe lol"
137095,never knew sadokist and henryg casted this...
137100,"it was a joke post, should have put"
137102,"you are better off going somewhere else with your logic that makes sense, it's not allowed in this sub."
137163,"because jinx, a champion who literally looks like a cracked out meth addict, fits the theme more"
137211,feels so good getting gold on every boss.
137316,at the rate they're going its probably better that they just kill themselves during the match
137360,you are not supposed to be nice to people who has a distinct disadvantage.
137374,yeah it's totally shit not being able to pick the same shitty op champs over and over and over and over and over again ruining the fun for everyone.
137384,"i understand why you included bjergsen and febiven, but why did you include jensen, the reddit circlejerk can attest to how bad incanati0n is at zed"
137495,"they listened, good thing people didn't overreact."
137560,"americans won us every war, didn't you know?"
137591,hopefully we'll finally get the new ak sounds
137606,you mean that planet with the small chewbukkas?

159830,"they release one update that is long overdue and now they care about cs... lol dota2 is on it's way to source3, we are begging for source2... vac is broken and a joke, pistols are broken, but hey they added a beta build 4 years later... they care we are all wrong for complaining."

161130,you're probably just one of those round earthers!
161151,must be because night elves aren't real illidari.
161169,yeah i'm sure g2 would run incredibly well if no-one watched anything they were in
161175,"there is one, it's called star wars: the old republic."
161197,garfield kart is leagues better than this simplistic racing game
161224,yes because the vast majority of cc abilities are spells or anything
161287,"how about just give them the trophy, no need to have world championship"
161327,"that'd be great, it would prevent plebs from playing the new chars!"
161431,out of all teams to start with you chose clg

161774,his hacks aren't working properly.
161812,zelda and mario definitely aren't nintendo's big games or anything
161814,pretty cool that they'd use a 5 year old game to sell a new device.
161857,i think apple has exclusive rights to nintendo games for the next 2 years so there won't be any nintendo games on the ns.
161867,"nintendo doing the same thing over and over again, no innovation 0/10"

165468,yeah its not like splyce won this blizzcon or anything
165505,"when trump said he wants or is willing to give up nato, how could putin not want to be his friend?"
165600,months after release we finally have a platinum hanzo?
165625,"nah, just some guy who was foolish enough to spam solo queue and ended up getting the short end of the stick."
165751,because something doesnt exist that means it isnt possible for it to exist
165957,the actual excuse is jus ptr
166092,did you pre-order or something?
166190,but faker has been playing worse and he is going to fall from his throne this year
166400,"definitely, because i desperately need this group to clear my raid ids."
166479,"not even the same generation sony, wtf..."
166524,"man, i love healers, but sometimes they're more annoying than dps with how needy they are"
166602,"right, and riot has never, ever said soloq was coming for sure and then said it wouldnt come."
166603,only took them a whole year to realize kog's update was bad...
166676,"i see you looked into it, rather than blindly believing op."
166714,so dks are why buff classes died :(
166727,god don't you just hate the colour blind
166814,now that play deserves to be on the front page of reddit
166868,because notch was fighting tooth and nail to not let microsoft have it
167134,"but they made that one fence harder to jump over, now it's properly balanced."
167163,how does she expect to get viewers with no cleavage shown?
167349,but... i pissed in the morning and said itv was legit...
167350,anyone here happen to meet this criteria and willing to inform us what the game is?
167361,don't justify a bad play -steel
167373,you better finish that homework because you definitely can't be a comedian.
167416,"then we need a character that can always 1v6, and lock it so it can only be used below platinum."
167472,"those were clearly custom games, he is a saint and does nothing wrong"
167495,"yeah, player skill most definitely doesn't matter at all on console"
167514,probably because it never happened
167527,"agree, why should we have to tryhard to win a game, they should make it easy for me to win it, people that play with friends should stop playing the game"
167552,best thing they've done since operation wildfire
167556,"while we're at it remove all cc from adc as well, because they're dmg dealers, not utility supports."
167557,yes because everyone is just like you

168153,"his q have 0 damage, his w dont give any steroids + low mobility, his e dont reveal champs so it is crap, his ultimate deal 0 damage..."
168182,yea could you imagine a washed up toplaner who was bottom tier in lck last year wow so hype
168202,no aimpunch if you 1 tap them though

168426,too bad he's bronze by the looks of the enemy team and we're all challenger here.

168522,"oh man, i've been looking for a new game for my iphone."
168656,"yeah we know, the best jungler in the world is svenskeren right?"
168762,yeah because a huge part of current shadow isen't paying attention to your dots and those 4 extra seconds of duration is totally going to make up for the fact that you have to recast all your dots manually..

169991,but how do we know the public version isn't pre-rendered
170001,should be seeing them at the next minor
170086,"guys chill, its just a small indie company let them work on it"

171157,"you make a good point, marketing is totally a useless tool."
171159,how else are they going to introduce a new website they found.
171185,at least it was consistent in a sense they already thought of outcome before making the case/investigation.
171207,it starts with being able to spell google.
171217,"lol, but the french are pussies, amirite?"
171225,"everybody know that pro-player only use aek-971 while playing on operation locker, so dlc is not required"

172452,"no it is flat out evidence, this man is clearly an analyst that knows everything he is talking about and isn't just talking out his ass to cause a shitstorm."
172470,aimlock so strong it picks up birds
172493,"what makes you think it's going to be a korean team, what about edg and tsm"
172514,pretty sure the lag is because they are using windows 10 on those alienware computers
172644,doesn't even mention the legendary fish123 team playing in group b
172657,yeah if all press release can be kept to one sentence i'm sure that'd be good

172935,i preordered the sunglasses dlc.
172968,"me2, i would be if i cared, just like gbm, but people are too trash for me too care, so i watch movies when i play soloq, me and gbm just don't tryhard when playing with those wimps (but we would be much better than them, if we cared)"
172976,but that's only because he got the easiest group ever
172985,please put the name of the game in your post title.
173014,you'll have to buy another hud after your hud updates itself 50 times
173016,because i'm max lvl and i don't need stupid blue weapons so fix it blizzord!
173116,yeah because every big boy always talks the truth in interviews.
173131,and that's obviously the most mature way to rationalize all this.
173134,maybe my trash teammates will actually contest dragons for once now..
173145,it must be my specific 4k monitor then
173158,"okay, now just give us ao shin pls"
173181,let's be honest who really misses twitch chat
173194,"rockstar employee here, how did you know?"
173210,theyre obviously hinting at what the fans have been begging for: state of emergency 3.
173253,"koreans are lucky, they haven't faced h2k yet"
173268,"i don't know about you but i really hope the new red dead game is a free-to-play, class-based first person shooter with moba elements."
173354,why have 300 frames on max settings when you can have 900 frames on minimum?
173365,"this is an alpha build, i'll be sure to ea the shit out of the real one."
173390,yes my fav team g2 will win now
173404,reddit posters shouldn't upload to such sketchy hosting sites.
173411,sorry to say it but you might have to add the
173423,"ofcourse, i want overwatch to be like a shitty moba with constant updates and balance changes every week because there's a character every three weeks."
173430,btw if you sacrifice 1000 of them you will get a special secret icon
173521,definitely worse than featured team like tsm and then fans crying for letting them down again one more time.
173524,what we need is young d.va and young tracer.
173546,how dare people of r/gaming vote democratically for a post to be at the top based on them liking the female body and cosplay skill!
173561,"no that only happens after the shield takes over 2,000 damage"
173577,"because said chick was *obviously* a gurl, you dunce."
173624,are you saying symmetra isn't dps?
173625,or you can be a no lifer like me and have 24k saved up.
173710,lets hope this doesn't have a ping kicker
173716,"good, i was almost worried that this shovelware would die"
173723,"nice clip, really goes with the title"
173724,"yea, and konami will announce the return of silent hills on psx!"
173776,"see, the real joke here is playing on a mac"
173803,"i always thought bastion's, beep boop, was actually, bweep bwoop."
173807,"easy guys, i think he just forgot his"
174188,ya without that i would have totally thought op made this photo
174447,"i assumed it was josh, why would op risk the karma"
174638,"man, you just wait till your support remembers to buy mikael and you will be fine ;)"
174894,"if they say dps is all that matters, change to reaper and say the same, then you can at least still heal yourself and they can't complain!"
175044,"i hope it sells bad, because if it does end up selling good, expect 2k standards of gameplay variety and quality in length to be at m3 standards always... which will be great."
175238,wow i didn't realize gambit would pickup an na player
175305,i pray to the internet gods that there is an unspoken
175722,"in titanfall, if you're not moving your camping"
175860,"yeah, it's almost like she sounds mexican or something."
176367,but you could ignite the caster minion for the free 5ad/ap!
176508,"0,3/30/0,9 12 games 84 deaths in 1 game... bad day boyz"
176559,since 7.1 a lot of us started having this problem.. yeah obviously the problem is at our side..
176692,"well we got that reddit one, right?"
176751,nah man unbeatable tryhard comps in the casual game mode was so fun to fight against
177419,"yes, let's blame apple because this is all their fault."
177629,because there's so many pieces that you could never possibly wind up with the same transmog outfit as another player.
177970,so that's where he got the idea of strapping a bomb to a balloon
178038,but he have 50%+ winrate so its legit imo lul
178048,"yeah, i'd love to see that sweet zed thormail meta"
178095,"he's good, he should consider go pro"
178135,get some super cool fallout 4 mods!
178169,i lost to a team of plats and got bronze 4 so everything seems legit
178275,they went a and they went b is always a safe choice.
178316,"yes i know what everyone is thinking, she shot her in the freaking eye but what if she intentionally didn't let her rifle charge to full power?"
178327,leavers doesn't exist on the other team.
178328,"for asians, the capture point actually damages whoever attackers standing on it."
178609,"get out of here with your flawless logic and common sense, we dont like guys like you!"
178716,"yeah, not like they've ever done anything"
178781,i bet you'd get destroyed if you tried playing this on console where people have aim assist lol xdd
178832,obviously going for the manga reading style from right to left.
178873,"yeah, cause everytime you sell your ps4 you lose your downloaded games"
178893,"of course that's not true, you don't get abuse at all when you're a white male, i read that on buzzfeed"
178986,"yeah dude, you're so right, i can't take mccree seriously because i know matthew mercer from the 20 other games he's been in so i only think of him as mattcree :\"
179065,"atleast the turret camps my lane, you don't even come bot."
179353,yeah it didn't the same response when i posted it in .gif format.
179453,"way to put the punchline in the title, op."
179463,"i dont know what the fuck you are talking about, i only got dodged 8 times today, even when i was autofill suport 2 of them."
179510,"if course it is, nothing is wrong with roadhog according to reddit"
179531,"yeah no awp is fine , in fact it could use a slight buff"
179642,didn't you know roblox has those?
179720,sounds like something an aimbotter would say...
179845,"eye can't even see past 30 fps, just put a frame cap so that the game runs quicker!"
180048,go fuck yourself you dirty cuck
180066,"if everyone thinks like that, the game's gonna kick all 12 players for being afk."
180118,i guess tardzaned is just another faker then
180140,"the walking dead so a game where they are at a farm the entire time, and part 3 where they are at a prision the entire time?"
180222,but the season 1 shyvs mains said she was more nerfed than buffed :(
180232,thank god we have brave internet detectives like you around to save us from bullshit keep doing god's work son
180270,he said kappa which is the twitch equivalent of
180350,"your playing it all wrong, everyone knows medics don't revive!"
180354,"dear solo queuers, don't solo queue."
180361,it clearly says 1 billion not 1000 million.
180459,"good work buddy, really helping him out here."
180484,clg is gonna win if huhi plays azir.
180573,yes because teams randomly sign players and dont try them out before signing them to see if they are good
180601,no you're wrong tsm are dumb and they don't know what they're doing and they're gonna crash and burn
180826,he isn't even trying to hide the cheats anymore
180871,would love to see ad and armor in 1 item on poppy
180973,the important matter is korea lost the gap is closing
180998,faker is falling off and lost in the 1v1 all stars that's why they signed another midlaner
181031,gotta love those ad-scaling shields
181092,damn a little to the left and it woulda been a penta kill =(
181147,"haha look at the shit these redditors said, think they're sooo original!"
181209,hey at least there are no more lane swaps
181312,"he said crown, didn't you read?"
181680,ummm don't know you know writing a letter means you are in love and its impossible for you to be friends
181759,"ahh yes, because we all know that the important thing when previewing a game is the menu."
181774,so 2007 game made with 2016 tech or a 2009 game with 2016 tech... boy we've come a long way
181786,she reminds the time the fucked
181827,these models are included in the 12/23/16 winter operation
181831,waiting for the 10 hour gamexplain in-depth analysis
181836,because warwick is heavily resembling blood seeker and i cant imagine the new warwick not having similiar skills.
181846,ugh i'm so sick of plants just saving bad players when they're caught out
181880,have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
181894,kirby's dream collection that game has *animated blood* and *cartoon violence*
181897,"nah dude, riot is literally hitler and qt is a saint"
181898,"but, but, uhhh... old mafia graves aa sound was sooo satisfying, that alone is reason for the rework to be reverted"
181918,voice line not even bound to a key ffs how else are you supposed to bm mid fight
181961,"based on his laugh, we can clearly tell that he's a boosted bonobo!"
181963,"nah dude, she's in losing team they said, she shouldn't be able to delete squishes who walks in range into stacked 8 sphere ult"
182026,hey man i win games when i play genji ): unless u mean against actual ppl bc i only use him against bots
182040,it was bought out by studio wildcard and they released a dlc called the rest of the game for $40
182049,what is this 'summoner' they speak of and how important are they to lore?
182143,maybe he just has a 144hz monitor and quick reactions
182192,"it seems that communism *did* work, after all!"
182360,oh my god you're just so fucking witty
182371,leggo boots + soul reaper = slight jog
182466,it's like blizzard wants people to stop playing druids.
182512,what season of big brother was roca on?
182540,with all the money they made selling 12 units?
182555,"oh no, what a shame, what a great loss."
182646,"yeah, adc going afk after a support gets a kills is definitely an average game."
182655,nah man hen1 just has better game sense and intuition then two legends of the game combined
182656,it's ok riot are taking like 10 ad off it so that should balance it
182666,nah they are just emberassed to admit they are former sonyponys.
182678,"there's your problem, put your cpu back in your system."
182681,even more proof flusha is hacking
182714,"pfft, don't be silly, black people didn't exist back then."
182826,maybe theyll add it in a monthly update
182859,it's because dragoons are always dead
182877,"oh boy, 4k kinect sports rivals!"
182929,bruh... that sylvanas mage priest though!
183074,well then it clearly isn't a fucking skillshot
183079,"i like a challenge though, and i'm white... it's like playing the game on easy mode."
183086,when you stay for too long in na
183112,world of warcraft has the best community!
183128,clearly you're just complaining because it's cool to complain
183132,well that's what they get for prioritizing danes
183147,"yeah, if only clg had a good na mid instead of huhi!"
183160,3 shard base now locks are fixed
183164,"its to boost my gf pharah who cant hit shit, fuck you!"
183169,which is strange for such perfectionists
183184,"so fake, no one works together that well in overwatch!"
183195,"yeah, recharging the staff is instantaneous when switching to your pistol"
183208,he put 2 tsm players what a delusional na fan
183242,his q is one of the strongest skillshots in the game...
183299,but powerofevil is the best western mid laner.
183411,i'm sure n0thing just gave envy a chance cuz he thought it was an easy win for them... right?
183418,"yeah they just rushed, it's not liked they used any set smokes/flashes or anything, and they just sat and waited when they played slow, it's not like they we're getting map control..."
183433,[the one after is just short of 40k and the one after that is just over 50k]
183491,"downvote, don't let anyone else use this!"
183522,why should i do that with widow when i can do it with hanzo and actually kill them?
183536,"of course not, blizz doesn't care about eu"
183550,"wow, what a great attitude to have"
183582,"[i'm not sure if its a permanent cure, but at the end of the last quest chain the tree grows to this form and begins growing fruit that can sustain them]"
183588,"see, this is why we need team mics to be default!"
183638,what do you mean nuke is perfectly balanced now that valve fixed it.
183646,best include more teams in the end of season finals wouldn't won't these teams to miss out
183647,must be cheating obviously thats 100% the only possible outcome here
183662,"might be an oversight from blizzard, since chaos damage is technically spell damage and tied to intellect."
183683,so when does it go free to play?
183723,nah that's a feature in the game
183745,"dammit, csgo didn't even work on my dial-up connection!"
183755,but i'm having so much fun on my lock.
183770,"ok sure, i am definitely going to believe you even though it directly contradicts what valve said themselves."
183776,"i just installed it, are you sure i shouldn't just throw my whole pc in the trash now?"
183793,a loaf of bread and 2nd pennies
183810,tfw when someone tfw when's somebody that just tfw when'd
183816,"well i mean, if she's sitting there in her lingerie..."
183823,well either you or your enemy is fucked so pretty balanced.
183824,"i believe this was only breached with the xbox one 's', no?"
183865,did they just assume my gender?
183899,"damn, i hate this bug it needs fixing."
183915,omg i cant stand off pixels i'm so ocd
183969,yeah but that doesn't fit the narrative that high ilvl meanies are screwing over the wow everyman at 830 by not letting them into their mythic groups.
183985,here's your number: 4 go at blizzard with that number and teach them to balance!
183992,"hiko, snax, flusha, jw, semphis (good fat, got skinny sucks) **edit**"
184004,dont tell me how to spend my money!!!
184030,don't worry blizz will perma ban him.
184077,both have never showed up to an international event
184083,and your moms maiden name/ first pet.
184106,new games much gave fk their skills up.
184107,at least we know he aint cheating cuz no aimbot would lock on a dove
184120,they got wet and become azsuna sea giants
184129,doom is running terrible even with the bad graphics for almost everybody...
184148,"shhh just repeat it with me: riot is bad, riot is proud, riot is greedy"
184159,simple trying immortals new headset strategy?
184162,at this point i think he is getting some sick twisted pleasure out of making rush watch him play lee sin on c9.
184204,horde confirmed superior faction
184239,light headaches could be because you are playing master yi
184272,thats cause your region would have lost anyway
184292,* well there is the great wall of *china* * it's the chinese gov *duh* * 2/3 of the country is a third world country *
184299,"and no matter where he hooks, he's gonna get somebody."
184304,"yeah, wildcard regions are way behind than the rest of the world... all the na players are mechanically better than players on other regions."
184321,no i think someone got confused because these games are gonna be free the upcoming february too.
184326,then again machine is only 1/4 of his age so he has time to improve
184366,the constant begging for my loot in dungeons/raids.
184386,wow first time i see this posted.
184395,"let's hope this smartphone fad ends soon, i'm tired of spending a whole $650 to have the internet, movies, music etc in my pocket, i miss my motorola flip phone."
184416,"i don't know about you, but padding meters in wailing caverns is one of my favorite pastimes."
184485,cause febiven wasn't good in 2015
184488,yeah they should definitely feel ashamed that some clueless people on the korean reddit are bashing them
184592,i mean pssh who budgets am i right?
184619,the sand worm is implemented but it's super rare so you'll probably never see one.
184693,you mean like those korean exports who want to get paid?

184710,"agreed, i hate this circlejerk of saying everything is a circlejerk"
184754,"those that understand binary, and those that have lost their virginity."
184796,wolf ain't even top 20 though...
184866,"pawn and looper just happend to be on the same team as imp, mata and dandy."
184879,some pro players take steroids so they can smash the buttons on the keyboard to make their attacks stronger in game.
184909,everybody in the chat type crispy is a stupid fucking okie
184918,"honestly, the browns are so bad we should push this agenda into local middle schools."
184921,guys it's obviously the magnificent seven tie-in game for the movie which is a re-imagining of seven samurai.
184944,"yes sure, let everyone spam 40 normal games to get rank 5 mastery before ranked, sounds like a good idea..."
184957,"just remember folks, don't preorder it!"
184970,man i don't know how many times i've gotten one-shot by leona aoe
184974,but then how will riot get your sweet rp moneys?
184999,"summoning is for scrubs, git gud"

185276,everyone knows that hanzo substitutes well for everything!
185316,valve listened to you for the r8 almost a year before you posted it!
185332,the thing that surprised me the most was that he healed
185352,"oh, the good old w-q-r-e-dfg combo."
185357,"and if you aint a weeb, it is taken?"
185363,you must be so good to have gotten a trident in bf1.
185366,"nah dude, killing some random demon houndmaster is sooo cool!"
185369,"valve is just letting you know, that you can either report enemy booster/cheater or add him to use his service :)"
185515,"nah bro, the remaster was totally necessary, the original looks like potatos now"
185567,you are the only person who has mentioned this in this subreddit.
185800,how is bf4 out if bf1 just came out
186425,kanalkarnaval is the best streamer how dare you criticize shitty girl russian streamers
186439,because its up to the animators to decide what mechanics get put into the game
186749,you should create a public announcement - i don't think telling this on reddit and twitter is enough
186920,doesn't make for a good person to identify with :/
186958,"thx 4 info, i bet u never saw a cheater before."
187319,yeah well koreans are hotter than sweaty white men

188463,"wow, you seem educated and competent"
188566,nah dude nobody can be good at league except faker
188792,there's definitely an overlap with pogo players.
188796,the meta does not suit you as well as it did last season.
188926,"you know what a batman game needs, more stealth missions in a fucking tank."
189049,put walls to block enemy vision and pass into places hidden

189167,can't wait for the ryze trolls!
189496,op better donate some of that karma to charity
189506,"yeah based on his expertise he knows a lot more than you, obviously."
189644,i can't wait for blingatron's vault to award 4k garrison resources!
189817,it's just an if statement to see if the killer is scoped in or not right?
189907,so that's why i've been losing a ton!
189912,"miss fortune, the singed counter with the instant ulti waveclear"
189917,"the man said he prefers fake guns on a game rather than fake bazookas on a fit chick, let him live."
189918,"nah brah, those people who have to live in student houses with 8 other people in a cramped house, can't afford luxuries and barely have enough for basic necessities, people who immigrate and work 2 jobs a day...all child's play compared to what god s1mple had to deal with."
189985,even with all the evidence against him flusha is my role model
190086,pretty easy you should learn to defend yourself and not rely on some strangers protection
190136,"damn that sucks, too bad there isn't a hero named genji that can deflect shots and get behind to hit their weak point."
190226,yeah thanks blizzard for releasing a character that isn't frustrating to play against!
190239,finally someone that didn't write
190392,"yep, after you level from 80-90 with archaeology why not stab your dick with a fork, sounds like fun all round"
190429,but will it give halo 5 split-screen co-op?
190448,"that's some great proof right there, he must be an alt cause he didn't say whose alt he was..."
190622,i truly hate it when artists don't change their art to fit my preferences.

191482,idk smeb gets alot of random mvp's this season when it shouldve been like peanut or pray i think he is paying mvp guy
191490,"ana's ult is totally fine, doesn't break the game in anyway shape or form and is an absolutely fantastic idea by the blizarrd devs."
191512,yeah c9 looks so bad without hai right now
191515,[you have to go rescue her as part of the dh class hall quest line.]
191516,so thats how envyus keeps winning
191528,because he knew there was no one behind him since he had walls ^^^
191551,"i mean yeah, must be pretty hard to listen to something that is written."
191553,kinda unfair to compare a finished game with cs:go that's still in beta.
191595,"not enough boobs for cosplay, shitlord."
191599,this is why you should always aim at the body
191626,yeah if you can't beat tsm-inmortals-c9 you don't belong in lcs
191696,"no, blizzard put 03:00-06:00 on the launcher just for shits and giggles."
191735,"you don't have to say yeah, but."
191746,"yeah, fuck those people trying to improve!"
191747,just go back in time to a point when it wasn't on cooldown.
191944,he was burnt out and needed a rest and fabby worked better with the team.

205803,you mean you don't like coming to a complete halt while chasing down a rogue to *try* and equip incendiary ammo?

205861,the obvious solution is to remove the warning!
205868,i fuckin hate it when you guys are all trash and i'm the only good player gawd.
205918,til the whole microsoft allowing you to buy games across windows and xbox and bringing more xbox exclusives to windows 10 is not kind to pc gaming...

207892,"wtf you probably know him personally and can share other interesting facts about krepo, his lifestyle and his character"
208027,you're either pulling too hard or moving while pulling.
208150,"yes, instead of addressing the problems we simply shouldn't play it."
208349,"don't act like you don't know what an aimbot is, op."
208440,because beating a handicapped person at basketball when you have been playing basketball for a few years makes you a god :p
208747,"do you want to hunt normal boring shit, or do you want to hunt demons?"
208894,can't wait for all the pro cheaters to get exposed would make this year
209205,"but if you stand right by their spawn, you get to kill them again faster!"
209443,"yeah, as a rank 40 player, you clearly need to play at a skilllevel equal to rank 80 to climb to rank 50."
209512,"2016 game development motto: if people are paying money to advance in it, then it needs no fixes."
209535,msl because he complained that astralis shouldnt use their coach and play 4v5
209572,because embrace the iris scares your team more then die and most of a time you need to chase them.
209611,"game breaking, rito please disable rengar"
209675,blitzcrank helping his adc even more with that very useful ultimate passive.
209680,"pfft, a couple quintillion off, what's the difference?"

210291,that's not surefour that's yung tisumi the up and coming ow player who is gonna replace surefour on cloud9
210383,"but dude, it was just a sponsorship!"
210438,you can still practice even in harsh environments.
210557,why cant people understand that competitive is about competing with your own team
210930,defently 9.5 out of 10 mechanics so... of course
210934,"very little cc against spellshield sivir, sivir being several levels ahead of most players, shen doesn't even react to the fight until it's too late... yes, very outplay."
210941,**how na wins worlds** - top: chauster - jungle: chauster - mid: chauster - adc: chauster - support: chauster - coach: chauster **its only a matter of time boys**
210996,because nba2k doesn't sell on pc at all.
211037,and the constant waves of enemies is always fun
211296,"nah dude, game is broken, blizzard ruined everything, they hate us all, my class is garbage because i dont understand it, pvp is crap now (i have no pvp talents but who cares), gg blizzard"
211301,"stop giving constructive criticism, you're just hating on riot."
211314,great - now we'll get even more bot lane pressure from every other player in the game.
211353,you can redirect the dragons if you ultimate as genji at the same time and slice them
211519,yeah he's not coaching sk anymore
211582,he just wants to show off his expensive knife
211649,"because without guns, no one would commit suicide"
211816,"but then if you play what your team wants, who will cover 4th attack hanzo?"
211854,i prefer baking sim 2016 for my cookie cutting.
211938,ahh that's why his winnrate is incredibly high
212049,wow stfu you fucking racist ^^^
212066,why hasnt the korean top teams realized that camping faker wins them the game
212083,"my capital o does the same thing, pretty annoying when typing fucking noobs."
212177,they need to be colored with brown and bloom
212233,"wow, smallest rank in the game takes time to get a server, who knew"
212280,and then he just told someone to kys in the next game
212341,"watch it with the kids, its a family show."
212357,that tank top just adds to the confirmation
212358,"you're closer to the satellites in a plane, so reception is better, you can see the high quality pixels on the screen edit"
212366,"[darkshire council join the legion, you go there for rogue assasination quest if i remember correctly]"
212379,"i like my weed pure and spare my lungs, so injection is the only way to go brah"
212390,"finally a uk team get's in to pro league, and it doesn't have rattlesnk in what are the odds"
212470,they totally ripped that design from the adder in gta v.
212517,making it harder to distinguish increases the skill ceiling
212520,and some say using a mouse is easy mode
212549,"yeah, his team going from relegations to top 2 with amazing macro game is probably because he knows nothing about the game"
212663,yeah it takes so long to make chroma skins
212666,the entire overwatch community feels guilty for the loss since you posted this
212727,rito pls i'm 2 lp away from promos to bronze iv so here is a drawing.

212975,actually its footage from gta vii
213024,never knew it was vr... totally going to pick up
213028,usually: as ct if t planted: kev+helmet + bizon as ct if t didn't planted: kev+helmet + mp9 as t if we planted: kev+hemlet + mac10 as t if we didn't plant: kev+helmet + mac10 as spectator if t planted...
213072,oh he won't but you gotta believe him cuz he said he was masters.
213075,write the code for it and send it to valve and i'm sure that if it's full-proof they'll implement it
213125,because thorin totally doesn't have an anti-tsm bias.
213129,for a new player that must be a cake walk.
213131,it's the mystic ruins from sonic adventure
213190,"of course you flame more when you lose, that's logical."
213224,"was pantheon a comfy pick, or did pantheon get buffed?"
213234,love how he criticizes the guy that didn't get the knife after he walked through molly and died...
213292,"meanwhile, human eyes cannot see more than 30fps."
213346,"alliance favoritism as always, blizz."
213386,yeah bro killing mobs for zero reward sure is fun
213405,what they didn't show you is the only way to the first point for attackers is a tiny door.
213415,memorial is only for people who did something
213445,"obviously a doctored video, no way can they be unlocked with coins"
213455,thank god for the colorblind options we have!
213456,"[it's currently inside the fragments of frost mourners alongside portions of arthas spirit, this is revealing in the frost dk artifact aquisition]"

213535,wait till valve releases another update
213543,fucking protoss with their i win button
213552,"nonsense man, no pro does anything just for the money."
213567,"yes and we should stop pointing out broken game mechanics to riot aswell, because they are the developers and we only play the game so they know better"
213584,plot twist: this is just to make the ladder more competitive during worlds for all foreign pros.
213595,he asked for league of legends characters not a religious figure.
213597,"mabye i'm omnicist, stop asuuming things, urghh ^jezz"
213627,i can't wait to see all the new models on their website because of all those skins
213629,well now i just have to know who's number one
213632,i love scrolling down my community feed to see 3 gta montages of women in underwear running around to a badly remixed song in the charts
213638,downloading the cheats obviously.
213649,"pfffssh, who needs bikes when they added 10 new really cool beanies!"
213658,"they could, they could ask to be in eu :^)"
213660,"you're right, blizzard sux, they put in shitty things to do, invasions superbad"
213667,"we got the cool yet already overused meme of making music with random stuff, that's not too bad."
213709,"yellowstar did great on the team, didn't he, must of been carried"
213728,cos boss man is trying to save money by getting his teams to bootcamp in the same place
213737,could you be a little more specific?
213782,"what are you talking about, moments before worlds is the best time to 'experiment' with morde!"
213839,"kind of like the film industry in vancouver, right?"
213903,since we are all challenger here this is good news!
213945,"yeah, it's not because we're cheapstakes"
213995,you mean the champion tryndamere?
214012,"it can, but the choice was 60 fps or split screen, and obviously everyone wanted 60 fps"
214034,"this list is bs, where is no man's sky?"
214038,"well, they've only pushed out like what: 5 patches in the last two weeks, so yeah - no support at all."
214040,lol its funny because autism is funny
214044,i bet the xbox players are super broken up about it too.
214092,send it to me so i can verify for if you got scammed
214099,a game about space feels empty you say?
214132,they would be afraid to kill others in game due to them being reported and getting arrested
214190,fuck you and the basketball you road in on!
214207,no because going to search for kills is way better
214224,... yeah its not like clg has ever shown the capacity to do well at an international event
214279,yeah winning 4v5 in that elo is common
214302,because you cant slow something down that has 0 speed.
214303,my dad works at nintendo and he said it's true!
214307,"of course no micro, they'll just follow like malz's voidlings, because that's way better design"
214347,"keep circlejerking, i'm sure that'll help"
214389,"^am chinese as well, very offended by this."
214404,"yeaah, that 90% p/b is only because you don't want anybody to pick that trash in your own team, not because he is strong or anything"
214409,"yeah, totally great considering you ran out of content 3 lvl's ago"
214429,because dps isn't the counter to tanks
214441,what does dark souls have to do with this
214482,this comment thread makes me so excited for a legacy server.
214490,"play mustard yi, right clik 2 win gg"
214537,ppl know me from my time at killerfish
214651,"or, everyone that is currently running windows 7-8.1, will wake up on july 31 and have windows 10 installed and no windows.old folder"
214721,omg i can't believe you all raped her like that!
214751,bro it's their team holding them back!
214755,"police force in the lcs studios, fuck yeah"
214854,"sorry, lyte already proved toxicity in other games with voice chat increased toxicity 140%."
214906,but everyone knows the only games people want backwards compatable are skate 3 and black ops.
214935,no clearly the voice actor is wrong
214940,i guess they don't want to risk being in the same situation as titan in late 2014
214942,bastion needs to be able to move in turret form
214948,"blizzard's gonna go back to platformers and racing games within the next 5 years, mark my words!"
214959,give it to meee i would personaly go to your house and smack the sht out of you if you get beta invite and not me and you won't use it :c
214966,yeah im gold rn but if i had 4 friends i could do it easy
214989,"wait... we can still play older games and consoles, not just the new ones"
215004,valve mm servers are 64 tick so must also use 64 at valve events and since players want everything to be like the majors everything is 64 tick.
215161,"sorry zed main, forgot it's super difficult to cs with your passive"
215181,he's on his worst behavior ^please^dont^kill^me
215184,"that means he surely can't be racist in any way, shape or form."
215199,good to see the jungle timers still in the game.
215209,tf - frozen mallet new meta you heard it here first
215265,oh that's what they were trying to say!
215269,"he looks more chinese than american, and he is much more thicker in the game than in this fanart."
215275,"hey, at least now you can save them up for higher mastery levels!"
215286,are you sure korea will offer him a spot as starting top?
215324,they are fairly useless; every time i see pharah ulti she dies in like 2 seconds
215356,yeah it's so shitty we should just stick with the current system right
215411,yeah no one can be original like you when you came up with that joke first.
215420,he wants every other adc to have the ability to kill the enemy support in 3 seconds then the game will be balanced.
215432,do you seriously expect someone to answer in a professional manner?
215447,"that's right, you become global/pro once you master the art of rng and luck"
215458,meanwhile sylvanas is off [making some kind of deal with goddamn helya]
215507,but your eyes can't even see 100 tick rate so we don't need it!
215508,i'm glad we have a representative for everyone in gaming like you
215544,"wow, i can't believe you were able to thwart their brilliant strategy."
215609,sorry for not wanting to support a candidate who thinks violent games are like drugs and alcohol.
215622,i think we could use more psa posts...
215640,yeah surface stuff is ugly and badly designed
215643,it's because yung stew steals his kills
215689,hey they fixed that by going on sale only down to $7 not $5
215722,well to be fair if it's not nsfw then it's clearly not worth my time :p
215724,so the garbage players magically become better
215728,"omfg give these mods to xbox now, just tick the box its super easy, fuckign scumbag modders"
215758,yeah because we play video games so we are all nerds xdxd we relate so much xdxdxd
215762,because they think urf take so much skills
215779,they were replaced with 80% science based cat-fox-creatures for budget reasons
215812,thats why you don't play skyrim on console.
215835,well i mean that because tsm is from na and na always has to be garbage.
215851,"oh nooo the average experience of players in a game that's been out for 8 days is low, however did this happen?"
215860,"yeah, that will totally bring back soloq"
215878,and no fear of tilting between games because you can only get into a game once every ten or twelve hours paradise
215908,but yours doesn't say genuine
215913,thats *never* happened to me as zaryla...
215946,"yeah, those can't be changed instantly."
215955,but battlefield is gonna be great right?
216009,it's an obvious flanking maneuver.
216109,of course not adcs are never right and only bitch!
216127,"ye, nip has a larger fanbase in na and people are obviously going to want to watch nip over a home favourite team or even american team like c9"
216129,because you know it can't be that itemization is legit fucked and it's so dumb having three viable champs at a time for years and years and everything else feels unplayably bad mid in season two had zyra diana cassiopeia morgana gragas karthus anivia orianna and khazix that's three times the variety we have today for adcs but adc mains just complain and complain but there's no problems
216177,"because games need to have trans characters to not be transphobic, and since blizzard are such horrible people who did not include any, we have to do it for them."
216205,"too late bud, this sub hate you now"
216281,maybe if rioters used dynamic queue they wouldnt rage at eachother
216309,yeah ruining the game for others is okay if you make money from it
216310,yeah let's remove him completely so tracer/genji can be even stronger and harder to counter
216331,ggg just trying to get every one to go into battle together and stopping you from chain 1v6 feeding
216336,"mercy's pistol feels like a peashooter, they should really replace it with a deagle"
216351,"you are playing one of the strongest early champs, if you lose or don't get fb, it's obviously your team's fault and they should know that they are shit."
216389,so it's a soma as a shooter in space.
216419,drunk riot cant tell the difference between each 3 hit proc champion
216434,"but i have no reason to buy an xbox now/i thought this was an xbox conference, why pc?"
216436,you're not allowed to be happy for other people on reddit!
216448,"i guess i hit the head or sth like that, not sure"
216450,as an australian i can confirm everything in this map is accurate and to scale
216458,inb4 zenyatta's health is nerfed to 120
216467,"yes you're always disappointing, this post is no exception"
216496,because visual clarity is bad somehow
216552,"uhm we should be thankful theyre even updating the game pal, you should check your privilege and not be so entitled"
216553,you just described the support/tank life who cares about objectives am i rite
216574,"i agree, one of the best players of all time, also my all time favorite."
216575,same can be said for msi hence eu didn't try
216592,"it's so hard to figure out, i know"
216612,"you actually hear the azir theme now when you're the ascended, completly new game"
216619,lately riot has really shown how much they care about that
216656,thats the code that unlocks an additional 2 cpu cores.
216661,turns out they set the cost to 6 as it was recommended by bcrypt (in 1999 when it came out)
216664,"yep, gotta get that nsa access to all yer porn and stuff, amirite?"
216729,wow that sounds like it's really worth my time
216751,yeah ofc homegrown talent duhhh
216813,yes im sure overwatch changed league demographic
216872,so you're saying most cheaters are women?
216877,because its not stealing if you pretend youre gonna buy it right?
216901,not all mei players are good players either xd
216914,but bruh tanks are boring all you do is sit there and take damage when you could be getting those sweet kills
216923,but that takes more time and i'm a highly ranked exports player.
216938,something console players arent coordinated enough to push with a reinhardt.
216976,"yeah, everything changed suddenly."
216977,if it wasnt for this game no one would've went to see star wars.

217207,man i wonder why the csgo devs don't communicate with the community
217215,"congrats op, you are the first one to think of such a meme."
217216,inb4 travis only interviews clg member
217272,"skarner, because i can ult the enemy alistar right into my team"
217275,but how else will i vent my frustrations about losing a game that surely had absolutely nothing to do with my own mistakes?
217317,"indeed, it is clear that quickshot is not just doing his job, but is in fact is selling out instead."
217371,they let lg win first half 12-3 twice to make the final more exciting

220688,i find it interesting you know what other people like please do tell me more what lies in my future?
220747,wait hold it that's an obvious violation of this subs rules your being edgy without a reaper flair!
220846,like all 11 who happen to live there?
220913,could we please get a worse quality these lines are too well defined and sharp
221134,"yep, nidalee has so much cc and a gap closer that works when you hit a very tough skillshot, very easy"
221168,but you can't get a 75% headshot kill ratio if you only kill 5 players.
221186,but at least we got them far cry's and cod's on sale..
221219,"to be fair they my be super strong wipes, very handy for wiping the cheeto dust and mountain dew ultra xtrememe mega dick flavour off the coffee table after the x-slab's controller has been thrown for loosing another match of halo."

221354,wow can't wait for s1mple to get back

221520,this story doesnt sound at all biased.
221583,"not worth it, i'm going to wait for the ultimate uno remastered game of the year deluxe edition."
221595,so glad to see this isn't an auto-mute and that dms are so reactive !
221689,"i think we should just use real guns and real bullets, that'll end the debate quickly"

222128,no it fucking isn't you bronzie
222152,that pun tho hahahaha lmao xddd
222194,that's what you get for using a rare genji skin.
222220,it's fine as long as the soul of the card stays intact right?
222317,genji needs to attack with his sword at melee attack
222336,they need to spend less now that lcs is doing poorly with viewership numbers and league is past it's peak
222347,yeah but obviously sencux is way better
222352,yes lets have everyone experience at least one seizure i mean they're not going to snap their necks or anything like that from incredibly violent seizures
222500,"remember, it's okay to call people out, just not on the internet."
222507,"this *totally* doesn't look like the 1,000 other minecraft videos out there."
222522,until riot inform them in the last minute that the line has changed therefore they are banned and must be sold in two weeks too.
222543,"no, i need to get my hate speech off this campus"
222545,"you see that is actually a hidden rule in the game where 90% of the time, bastion will get potg 100% of the time"
222551,you could be like all the locks i've played with while i've tanked and just pull the mobs before the tank does!
222597,the human eye can only see 24 degrees
222679,"makes sense, i guess headaches don't exist either then..."

222774,yeah lets just go back to lucian ez meta where everyone was having so much fun
222788,"hmm, i wonder why the coaching style of msi edg is similar to c9"
222800,and that my friends is why *junkrat is balanced*
222804,still holding out for s1mple to form super team signed by nerdrage with rattlesnk release henryg and webber
222844,yes because it was the bronze players who complained about azir
222845,but its a cosmetic which does absolutely nothing for actual gameplay and so i want it for free since blizzard isnt letting me play overwatch right since people with skins are obviously stronger than people without.
222872,they should fix him like they fixed widowmaker
222922,as a zookeeper i'm so glad that what was easily one of the worst days of his keepers lives turned into a fucking meme.
222984,"but beware, coz you are forced to buy them."
223018,he must have a skin changer hack
223037,"nah, you have to ult in your own goal."
223074,my thoughts are that you need to get 6 more hours and quit the game
223112,"obviously none of us are bad, it's our teammates!"
223218,what you fail to see here is that kio was the problem.
223237,nah skins are what makes you win.
223400,guess the launch of legion got pushed back a few years huh?
223419,as if playing with shara on your team isn't torture enough.
223435,this must be the great customer service i keep hearing that blizz has.
223585,vit clearly had the best players in every position.
223590,"thank you, xxpussy_bangerxx, for telling people when they are allowed to be annoyed with people calling everyone cunt"
223640,"toxic queues, just what we want eh."
223659,oh look it's the uncounterable totally op crazy ultimate that genji has which drastically needs a nerf
223674,"hey, but rito has no booths, so people can see the players and maybe shake hands, this is so much better then everything else..."
223683,so good that rift is doing so well
223705,yes because people would have such a hard time choosing between the two
223706,yes because it's so easy to make sure every program and piece of software doesn't conflict with vac
223726,"yeah, nothing beats getting bursted for half your health at level 2 in under 1 sec"
223741,i hope you're not a leatherworker... spoiler tagged for courtesy: [one of the quests for lw involves climbing to the very summit of highmountain itself to read some lore off a skin on the edge of a precipice.]
223761,so they just want to make sure vp staying as premier?
223840,"man, league of legends is dying guys"
223841,"yes, because by clicking this link i gave him ad revenue and hits for his blog"

223949,"think it's just you, might want to reinstall"

224241,"yeah, it's not like i'll get down ranked even further making the game think i'm terrible and making it even harder to get to my actual skill group"
224252,"yes, because that's how hacking overwatch works"
224264,"blizzard, next time you make these events please make crates dupe only."
224277,"maybe peke has financial ties with h2k, and they will be seamlessly trading hybrid with forgiven"
224280,it's truly a shame that a game this good didn't make any money because it released without drm and therefore nobody ever purchased it.
224314,"oh yeah, ulting with genji is a lot easier than ulting with reaper."
224336,like venom mine sombra is widow's sister confirmed
224362,"yes, how would you understand the story?"
224366,enemy was probably tabbed out of the game
224369,the technology isn't there yet.
224375,"oooh, look at this fiesty one, i bet you're a reaper main."
224430,"okay, but only if you mail me $200 dollars first."
224510,"you dont understand, he just got solokilled by one of the strongest 1v1 mages in the game with a supportive champion, that means all his past success is irrelevant now"
224528,"yes, that is *exactly* what i said."
224531,so you aussies talk about your scrimps on the barbie?
224555,my secret route when playing lijang tower is to disconnect my router so i don't have to play it.
224569,"for the sake of the circle jerk of lies, yes... that's exactly what it is"
224587,"this picture is fake, women don't exist on the internet"
224616,"not all head shots, fucking noob"
224620,you're gonna need that $10 for those ports
224622,don't forget to drink plenty of water.
224624,this is a new and exciting question

224779,stewie2k has been known on the scene for so many years.
224816,reported for advocating drug use.
224864,no because they know what's best.
224953,"some of them identify as attack helicopters, it's fine"
224983,but i need a k/d spreadsheet on everyone i'm playing with to properly assess if they're life choices will get me another loot box.
225016,number of active players on the server is roughly equal to those shown in the picture.
225082,one game clearly means he is bad
225090,"in the same sense that we have tiered progression today because there are tiers, right?"
225093,speak for yourself you ugly fuck obv
225103,why according to the koreans their both about the same as wc
225146,"no, deilor best discipline coach in the west ever, have a downvote!"
225161,"well, messi has played for the catalan national team since he was like 13 right?"
225169,"they're not the best teams, they just beat every other team in their own regions duh"
225174,thank you for mentioning something that everyone already knows
225207,"motherfucking serial killers these days, you can't stop em."
225217,definitely a revolutionary idea i don't see on this sub every week

225269,but then how will we see out hit markers?
225281,"doesn't have jontron's signature, totally trash"

225297,also makes sense why you won the lan too
225387,"this is the internet, don't apologize, keep arguing and insult op's mother."
225413,this must be why they laid off 10% of their workforce
225415,i mean we only killed a couple chinese in that one massacre.
225428,"but that will leave ekko with only 2 slows, a stun and a reposition ult he will be way too immobile."
225432,"no fingerless gloves, literally the worst costume ever"
225433,"you can detect sarcasm on the internet, people.. it doesn't need a goddamn"
225436,you have cancer [as your astrological sign... see the importance?]
225522,everyone says its easy but then they pull crap dps
225538,no wonder they are making a new playstation with these crap graphics
225543,totally revolutionary attention to detail
225554,can we please make the game easier?
225571,bootcamping the best region obviously
225707,"that's probably their reasoning, rarely used so it would be ok to get it off, so kevin and his 4 dq friends that doesn't know what skills does isn't playing an infair game due to hidden power."
225714,still better than mordekaiser marksman
225731,reaper reload is still the best
225733,"i think the title is misleading, retiring from professional play implies you have been pro at any point of your career."
225776,"yeah, sure, they should also give hanzo curving arrows and widowmaker the ability to hang upside down."
225778,all it needs is the guitar in t spawn.
225804,"because everyone that played everquest was a fat greasy guy living in thier mom's basement, right?"
225812,dae think 90's pokemon commercial was best amirite?
225838,but... riot is just a small indie... they don't have the capacity to make their own costume kits.
225840,"quick, type player.additem 00039be4 1 in the console."
225882,you mean paying 3 chest for probably 3150 or half each for one single champ would be bad ?
225887,he's given your team false confidence so that he could come in and crush you all.
225897,and an excellent anti cheat system.

225978,well thank god i live in australia
225997,"try pressing play, you will be presented with a number of different gamemodes you can try out ~riot"
226011,he might not throw a molly to lose the round.
226031,"i have 6 cents on my steam account, will that be enough?"
226068,maybe fnx is just wearing a beanie today
226117,"man buying a white shield off an npc or investing the 15s for one off the ah is too much effort, you have no idea."
226160,"we have a long weekend right now, we won't go anywhere"
226168,calling zarya an object after identification is incredibly sexist...
226182,how dare blizzard offer fun intriguing gaming fun for your friends.

226211,maps are completely bad and shouldn't be in the game in any way or form
226217,"it's heavy and pyro all over again, good thing blizzard learned from tf2's mistakes"
226278,"bastion, torb, mccree, tracer..anyone else on the list for you, sir?"

226367,it's actually platinum in brazil
226381,can't imagine why he didn't wind up with a grenade launcher
226410,well that just goes to show how culturally rounded i am...
226414,"he could have done that prior, with duo queue, and those only get boosted up, they'll fall to where they belong once they play also it's a problem with riot not banning him for abusing smurfing and taking money to boost people regardless, i didn't ask for proof of boosting, that's existed since the beta, i wanted to see numbers that support that rank is devauled, i'm sure diamond 5 now accounts for 20% of the playerbase now"
226426,whoa slow down bro they're just having fun and you're a try hard.
226427,"yeah, more free content, what a joke!"
226434,germany and soviet russia certainly thought so
226441,ww [were created by the children of the forest to defeat the first men]
226460,did anyone else think the ct with a galil mounted with a reflex sight on shoots completely embodied the theme of cs:go?
226475,i'm sure league would be a great game if riot kept immediately flopping their game design back and forth between what people were complaining about at the time.
226499,without karrigan they're just astralass
226506,"cause allison road *was* cancelled, but sharon street will be announced soon."
226525,good to see insight from the director and screenwriter

226551,this new mata guy is pretty good china has good players and talents
226578,if you think landing a hook takes no skill you should play him and reap your 100% hook accuracy card.
226584,in his defense you *are* a shitty.
226623,no one was born before 2008... so how can we remember something like this?
226630,because most of the time it's over at first blood
226641,i mean we neeed that space for more shroud clips instead of useful information.
226741,nooo...warowl said therefore it must be absolute fact.
226746,"guys this nothing, just wait for skyrim remastered!"
226770,"how dare you dude, sure, there's probably hundreds if not thousands of league fans that die all the time, but christina is obviously a better human being and more important than all of them!"
226780,yeah it's not like i've made the worlds best serverside anti-cheat for the source engine ever or anything right?
226803,thats why the meta in competitive right now is 5 torbs
226813,tank fizz is so fun and interactive to play against.
226833,wod is great in that it provided a good leveling experience and good raids and then was courteous to give me enough of a break to finish off the content in older expansions i never had time to finish.
226840,"cmon op you still had your mine, only a noob cant make that recovery"
226841,"oh, but her movement is op, you couldn't dunk her, because she headshotted you mid flight."
226846,hurrr the console gamer isn't used to a keyboard and mouse how can i ever respect him now
226850,"seriously, the guy even hid behind minions and the q still hit him."
226871,but don't pre-order or they will turn into demons and stop production!
226894,"yes, out of the thousands/millions watching e3, you are the only one excited for the game."
226898,maybe he meant they'll quickly whip one up in sharefactory
226899,it's almost as if it's a beta or something like that.
226901,worgen female casting animations are really great you'll love 'em trust me - why would i lie to you?
226906,"but kha'zix can only evolve thrice, and four times maximum."
226954,"double damage like in twilight princess hd, instead of 6.5 hearts of damage the guardian will deal 13 hearts of damage!"
226956,"get out of here with your reason and logic - women are playing video games and doing better than i am, and that is unacceptable."
226974,you defintely know what everybody did expect at diablo 3 release.
227024,but who needs a burnout based iteration when we already have that on forza 6 online?
227061,yes but this guy is asking about herobrain
227087,no he's just a person of superior intellect that you and i will never equal
227131,"nah man, the ultimate skin would switch it around!"
227218,"fuck, if i didn't have that god damn low ammo sound i would've won all those 1v5 clutches (which came to me because i baited my teammates)"
227234,"last i heard, they were working on a new spider-man game"
227287,i remember when i first played illaoi i thought her q did zero damage because i only read things one time
227288,can't tell if you're one of 'them' or just being
227327,no that's what dynamic queue is for
227333,but didn't you know that everyone interested in swords is a weeb?
227339,"but please with subtitles during the interviews, so that people are able to understand them"
227359,thats how fnx and fer would play csgo without fallen
227406,but his crimes are worse than murder
227577,"no man, you won't be able to queue up for a ranked 5, nobody ever played that!"
227652,"yes, riot has a long history of valuing flair over balance, as can be see by the extensive and living integration of lore into the core elements of the game."
227670,how are people going to level up their bots without it
227707,sprint focus sprint arena1 sprint duh
227737,but this raises the skill ceiling
227764,"i suppose that's why lighting in real time rendering, and non-real time rendering is its own profession and has encyclopedias written every year about it."
227793,konami found where the guy lives.
227864,"see, it lacks at least one extremely bright color and the head of a mythic beast so obvious shit duh"

228530,"nah, then people would have to actually get on the point, would never work"
228883,"unrealistic, the deag's standing accuracy is too tight in this demonstration"
228997,don't worry dude you deserved that derank you got because you obviously aren't good enough to play with people above that level.
229027,"why play zarya, roadhog's biggest counter, when you can make a reddit post!"
229445,ohh man...clearly not a fan of those awsome gloves rip

229603,gtfo we want the juicy gambling drama
229633,toxic scrub get gud i have skills on hanzo i can out snip the top 1% widowmakers
229720,ugh the realisticness of the physics is sooo good how is that even possible in a video game
229774,it's not gambling it's risk management
230033,the stun + fan the hammer instakill was a lot better.
230103,that's what he gets for trying to go against the na overlords optic.
230287,"i am not feeding, i am initiating the fight."
230292,because that's exactly what plasmasnake9 was implying
230453,"sure, there is no difference between the epitome of toxicity and being rude."
230454,"yeah, that's why it was changed, because it was so easy to play against him."

232231,"legion spoiler: [broxigar appears in a flashback/memory of the war of the ancient, you even gets to help him as illidan. ]"
232248,lose a game without having hanzo genji or tracer in ur team.
232283,because you were so clear on that in your post
232284,because skill dictates someone's right to own a valuable and sought after item
232307,expected a serious video was extremely disappointed as a ryze otp challenger main since season 1
232317,"alright blizz, time for another alternate universe!"
232453,in before it turns out you are the channel owner.

233134,"holy shit imt beat tl, that means imt is stronger than tsm right?"
233188,"thanks for snitching, i'm sure they really appreciate it."
233235,they just had one month to do that skin... and pbe is for rankeds
233242,because the 2 other legit low ranks in the opposite team deserve to get fucked sure..
233283,##!### that's the hardest part!
233316,"confirmed op clickbaited us, was only in it for the seaside"
233317,moe is still salty that he couldn't go to columbus with liquid
233443,what he meant to say is that gorilla harambe had never hurt anyone before so idk why everyone was worried when he started swinging a child around
233480,love it when games introduce new mechanics in the last level!
233526,"well shit, i guess i'm not allowed to reference the movie then"
233533,get_right wasn't going anywhere with nip anyways so good move for him!
233573,oh so these are the high quality pixels that the new xbox can produce
233576,three mid diamonds should be able to take on huni.
233597,yeah because that's the game team ninja is remembered for.
233610,"i think it's because of the flash lol, we all know that no one would ever throw a flash like that unless they are 100% sure that someone is there... and we also know that no one ever uses that spot on cobble!"
233728,believe it or not you're the first person to get suggest this!
233730,"yeah , cause every org that has come into the lcs from promo tournament has been great!"
233774,"total bomb, which was entirely shat up by critics and players, right?"
233807,they're blind you need to guide them out
233820,still worth it to showcase my skill on riven
233822,but theres 18 quintillion planets
233826,"cmon guys it's still everyone knows the client is still in alpha, and for this small indie company is difficult to process so many requests at the same time"
233834,"my winrate is great on a smurf, it allows me to flame any shitter that i play with."
233845,yes they should definetly mention tf 128 bpm in his tooltip
233853,people like you ruin the portal business!
233922,"undertale deserved it much more, just sayin'"
233996,"why are you complaining, they are obv working on fixing the game, rather than some dumb picture"
234056,that's some rusty metal on mirage
234066,"then we'd have add-ons, not mods"
234069,but...its nearly impossible to do that!
234083,"hmmm, a totally blind person wouldn't even be able to see it but i can't argue with that logic"
234130,it means they are trying to be helpful and make you avoid repair costs *thumbsup*
234144,fnatic&lt; epsilon hltv ranking confirmed
234174,do you want to play a tiger or a chicken
234197,but dude just ignite him makes his q heal 800 instead of +1600 that's enough counterplay
234198,thats why iam hitting the towers instead of the champions .. iam not missing them
234201,thanks for fucking up the thread with your political shit.
234209,yea dice totally listened for battlefront
234213,situational awareness is the essence of survival!
234243,isn't is an ostentation of pedants?
234299,"wow, who would have thought that a procedurally generated game about exploring would become predictable and boring."
234317,"yeah, because a book of canon overrides the info given in the game itself"
234323,so funny because he pirates games xd
234328,uh huh i'm sure animation cancels that provide unnecessary power are so core that they're never mentioned in game and get procedurally removed when it's obvious the hero is receiving more power than intended due to a trick is a fucking core aspect
234425,"nah man, he like, mixed it all up again."
234465,u knew it what it was when you signed up
234476,i feel like it would be good if we could see our score all the time as well
234534,lol you could have bought a better pc for the same price.
234546,"yes, tsm lied and riot just believed them"
234582,this is the sacrifice needed to get knack on ps plus
234589,it's to pay for all the quality games they give us every month!
234592,"yeah, the whole $60 for all 4 expansions and base game is sooo much money"
234595,i prefer nanoboosted d.va popping up her ult
234610,idk man if you can't rank up out of silver it's probably just you
234624,that's how he makes it look real
234731,"money is hard to come by, are you making fun of me?"
234740,killing off a playable character to validate the lore is totally a reasonable thing to do in a fps game.
234745,well to be fair to fans skt and samsung white really struggled against intermational teams while stomping all over other koreans
234746,hey man not losing tower is not losing at all
234792,"yeah, the right way to speculate is to get overly excited and hyped about what it might be and then get pissed off when it's not exactly what you thought it was!"
234805,yeah because people don't bitch about anything xbox related or threaten to go to ps4 on this sub at all.
234815,a replacement that's just as toxic
234837,wow okay i see you are clearly the superior human being and i will from now on refer only to you in all matters of taste.
234900,nah zen was fine he only had 99.6% pick rate
234957,but that would take out a huge chunk of valves revenue from csgo
234983,ya the npcs are kinda whiney bitches but they're at least less salty than the people playing this game can be
234993,it obviously stands for heckler &amp; koch.
234998,.. and then we go back to should i buy the gold headphones?
235034,"ok, i'll just play compet... hmmm, i can't seem to find competitive mode."
235035,literally got downvoted yesterday in the just give us a support for weebs thread for saying that its funny how everyone assumes every genji player to be a weeb even when we even aren't... really makes me think about changing my flair to mercy because everyone seems to love mercy
235040,you must've only bought half the game
235047,bruh golden tate/marvin jones/85 year old anquan boldin best receiving core
235070,these evil libraries are taking money from the pockets of innocent publishers!
235071,ah i enjoyed the constant smurfing and hacking involved in cs.. that's about it.
235074,"cmon son, 'z' is for cooldowns sheath/unsheath goes on mouse button 11, get with the program!"
235097,the vlad nerfs are so huge they will ruin him
235209,but this sub is independent from rito
235252,omg je suis en criss en plus pkp a demisionner je suis vrm triste
235303,sounds a like a healty state for him
235307,but how else will i learn azir except putting myself in a high preassure situation?
235315,"monks are totally fine, you just need to make your healers stop healing you above 80%."
235381,"nah bruh, just gotta test that banning the champ work"
235423,yeah because dragons have been so heavily contested since the change.
235442,i feel like im becoming gay every time i see his face
235467,if it carries on like this we'll be the leaders of our factions as well as our class.
235503,because rooting for a different team after yours is knocked out makes you so fake
235512,yeah because steeelback was such a god at last years msi
235517,i guess this leaves you but for one option
235539,as opposed to their massive progress on other maps of course.
235602,"yeah, i'm sure teams are well practiced on nuke after it being in the map pool for 2 weeks."
235623,til reddit is governed by congress and considered public domain.
235626,"that free widowmaker skin, which is literally the only thing making it $80 is so worth it"
235630,"yeah movement speed is pretty useless when rotating, that's why sivir isn't used in mobile, out-rotating comps."
235638,can't argue with that line of thought
235693,they can't release it because it will cause a massive jump in street racing deaths directly linked to the game.
235696,"no dude hacking in overwatch is literally impossible, all hail blizzard for their wizardry"
235743,please be sure to keep everyone posted!
235775,"he solo killed faker that one game, best mid in the west, completely on par with kr mids."
235787,"yes, because everyone knows rednecks are the most dangerous people on earth and shoot anything that moves"
235789,aint none of those are even close to zoids!
235791,but they are koreans so we must value their opinions more
235797,omg this is degrading to women blizzard pls remove
235821,"nah you got it all wrong, if an na team beats anyone, it's because that team sucks."
235883,but...but everyone loves rayman
235892,downvoted cause it's not with awp vs silvers and bots
235931,sorry didn't think i needed the
235961,because ekko/poppy/maokai top every game at msi is so diverse and fun to watch
235965,just buy all the icons from the store
235994,"fuck you, you're the one who's cancer."
236006,"[i thought this jaina is a dreadlord was just a little joke, but after doing the alliance starting experience in the beta i really think she might be.]"
236050,"and you can absolutely mute them in post-game chat, too."
236051,but i have to get that one tracer in the back of our spawn that is obviously not just there to distract the team and waste time.
236054,yes because my god there were literally hundreds of them everyday
236133,do you really think people will pay to download content that should have been in the original release?
236142,is that why we're permabanning him?
236165,"yeah , theres also na import in eu named gamsu"
236186,i wish the game would play ...
236227,that's exactly what a scripter would say if he wanted me to think he wasn't a scripter!
236228,more like team fortress 3 _amiright?_
236256,every raiders fan looks like it is though...
236260,"riot is great at buffs and nerfs, really are."
236272,"yep, nothing like instakill headshots from a full auto weapon to make a good fps game"
236305,"i was joking haha, didn't think i needed to"
236314,over the shoulders is a little too sexual
236315,"forg1ven's toxicity strikes once again, no wonder why the team underperforms"
236360,but i keep charging him and he just kills me so fast he is so op blizzard please nerf
236400,but the multiplayer for doom is so shit!
236418,nah we have 3 widowmaker we got this ez
236425,gotta get that molly off for a safe plant in a 2 v 1
236429,yay rng progression incentives.
236460,i just lock genji in every game
236462,dude get over it... the wait for a match is so short that you can just find another...
236532,the risk about leveling smurfs is that there is no risk.
236533,"don't right click as zarya, dude!"
236539,unless its flusha who can see through the smokes
236544,for a second i thought i was watching keemstar's stream
236556,"his steam inventory is tasty af, gonna have to go with millionaire, only logic reason."
236590,"i mean 4 hours, a year, they're essentially the same"
236601,"call of duty: infinite warfare 2 and 3, probably"
236604,... please tell me you're missing the
236615,"there's this guy from ukraine...uhh...whats his name again...oh right i think he's called s1mple, i feel like he would be a great addition to the team."
236616,"no they're talking about giving it bad scores, you gave it a perfect rating... wow unbelievable looks like blizzard's paying off reviewers!"
236659,i wonder if people will consider aphro calling stixxay the best bot lane partner he's ever had somehow a shots fired at doublelift
236662,but how will my teammates know they are bad if i don't take the time to tell them they are bad?
236679,"this is why you have kids, you can have them grind out achievements, and now the lawn and fetch you beers"
236701,because reviving those two hanzo's is so much better than reviving your reinhardt that is tanking his ass off
236718,how's that windows 9 running on your pc?
236726,"because she's a gamer and all gamers live in basements and eat doritos, duh!"
236727,"you can't discuss it here, you can't create a fantasy league... only place dq is legal is on lol client..."
236740,"scuttle can't talk so you shouldn't be assuming their pronouns either way, cis scum."
236764,i'm using the colourblind settings so this doesn't make sense to me.
236773,because rito isnt a player focused company and are ded set on screwin us with dq
236813,"adds up, instead of getting better he eats wings"
236879,"yes, i am dmg (pre patch)(now sem) and play like global volvo fix pls"
236884,"0/10/1, gotta give him credit for that assist"
236902,"it just got patched unfortunately guys, guess valve was quick to patch this one fast..."
236939,if you buy overwatch you can't see ads for it anymore.
236955,how can it be a wicked painting if its rengar not irelia?
236957,"and it seems i accidentally deleted this post on mobile, awesome."
237013,because you can't have more then one team you are a fan of.
237037,no i'm pretty sure it's just a dx12 tech demo
237063,"sweaty nerd faggot, get a real job"
237088,because they are blinded by the salt that mini sentry is creating to notice his shotgun.
237120,"for sure, spamming arrows in the general direction of the enemy takes a lot of skill."
237137,you are weak if that already got you hyped.
237163,finally releasing the pc version on console!
237185,i think the best way to end these tanks would be for you to apply patch 6.11 (which destroys tank ekko) and for you to apply patch 6.12 later this week (which destroys tank fizz).
237206,yeah i much rather play call of duty: global offensive than to make jumping bullets deal no damage
237214,until they pull another kickstarter
237234,"sheeet man, i got $501, come holla at me and my rich ass, yo"
237253,"bur we all know league is the source of the word toxicity, so we gotta blame it"
237312,oh no my cs:go ptsd is getting triggered
237348,wow very interesting there will be a lot of people watching you while euro is on
237384,"i mean, he is a redditor, of course he knows better than anyone"
237430,give back his fucking knife bro
237434,"yes, more bandaid fixes will solve this huge mess eventually, im sure."
237436,"i'm sure glad that streamer added his dead, emotionless face to the game... it really adds to the experience."
237440,"this is what you need to pay to play yearly titles, and not to mention 400$ upgrade every 6 months, that's why i have a peasantbox"
237461,but we all know that a person's individual skill is solely defined by their team's overall performance at all times.
237469,how the hell did you get my gameplay?
237477,you either responded to wrong person or didn't realize
237521,"even immortals beat them, nip is not top 5, they're overrated as fuck."
237596,time to stock up on lg stickers boys
237633,ugh you sjw's and your obsession with representation
237744,probably they had a widow in attack and that player got bashed on wtf widow in attack omf noob widowmain change so he changed and no tourrete counter for you then.
237747,she wanted to use her pistol cause that's better than damage buff
237748,yeah because this video was totally to showcase the plays from a katarina player !
237757,"hey, don't be dissing my girl, lymle, kay?"
237790,can't we just hate in peace without people like you ruining everything?
237841,*warwick* what a quality jungle choice
237859,"damn, it was so hard to put all the schedules in every article; thanks god we have the option to make people have to change regions to be able to see their own timetable..."
237916,"well i can't think of any friends that live outside my state, so all other states are dead."
237935,yea gonna suck when all their eu teams get knocked out
237963,you arguing that bo5 is to boring but you watch baseball?
237965,i tell you that rek'sai is the worst jungler ever ;)
237992,"wow, i did not see that coming."
238001,you'll be doing awesome with that unleveled artifact weapon of your alternate spec
238019,you'd think he's a terrible owner considering his team members are so unhappy
238042,yeah...licking the orifice of a shit extruder is like pretty awesome.
238062,"no trust me, the 750ti and i3 569408 are totally better than a console, see it runs this benchmark of a multiplatform game at *35fps* on a custom config!"
238132,still calls himself smfc after rank change.
238138,ur right its a conspiracy against taiwan
238238,not to sound rude but : that was pretty rude
238269,maybe soon we'll be able to upgrade our consoles too!
238285,yeah cause those squishy tanks are way better
238547,yeaaa writing something on a tombstone takes sooo much time its unbelievable.
238987,"people don't win contests, it's photoshop."
239512,when has riot not done anything great?
239562,hurt durr name of game in title?
239596,"well if you've never encountered those issues, i'm sure no one else has"
239975,"thorin also admitted to trying a cheat in 1.6 in his 200k subs video time to take the trash out of cs:go boys, les go"
240203,of course tsm is gonna win worlds see how they are steam rolling na
240375,on the same day that hillary doesn't get indicted
240511,man i just watched straight outta compton and the us seems like a very violent country i will never go there.
241051,blizzard just can't get things down huh?
241062,"oh look a throwaway spewing bullshit, the can't possibly be a troll at all."
241073,xbox 1 is ded without skate 4-1
241155,the rule is the louder one the participants gets the quicker you clap
241197,here send it to me for in depth analysis of said case
241318,can't fan the hammer with an smg.
241336,"actually the launch was like 12 minutes late &amp; now this ranked debacle, get your shit together blizzard"
241467,yea because if there wasn't lcs he wouldn't have to practice to mantain this level of mediocrity
241471,so he's basically playing at console fov?
241475,so you're saying the mobile mario kart game is a bad idea?
241561,don't you know your matchmaking rank is important xd?
241660,"i don't think its fair to say that, we got some much needed twitter integration."
241704,don't be a dick aka don't say anything contradictory great policy...
241758,yeah it was a much better decision to just add nuke instead of some shitty map like season.
241837,as a riven main i approve of this bug.
241857,yes let's kill one way valve supports the funding of majors
241859,"jokes on you, trying to get my karma down to my lucky number!"
241866,doesn't that just mean kinda black?
241924,"everyone on my team, every game."
242048,lets just hope rapehorse is a playable character
242180,never you mind all that free shit they gave us and the consistent updates those shark cards are the real dlc
242339,"430690 now but i now know why na is so bad at cs, their pros just smoke pot while paying ppl to 69 with them instead of playing cs..."
242522,"yeah but now ryze has a global, thats much better."
242530,how could i have been so blind?
242531,so i guess valve are good guys after all.
242624,i didn't think it was needed..but
242669,so jealous that my ps4 friends will get to spend their money a month before i do.
242677,fucking genius dude can't think how no one have ever thought about asking for this
242746,"and lets not allow any graphics change at all, ultra all the way because then the game doesn't look the same everywhere"
242770,i did not like it so nobody did like it
242813,*insert generic comment from 'special citizens' on how blizzard developers are better off fixing the dying game.
242825,"no king no king tra lala la [rest in peace, varian.]"
242878,"naw, cheaters aren't best players."
242914,yeah because that worked out for him before
243019,you could've brought your own pc
243107,because online petitions totally have a high success rate.
243108,the black one came out years ago
243178,this is exactly what someone using an aimbot would post.
243191,"stupid adult, if any kids see this he will assume beating innocent turtle creatures is okay, fucking degenerate i feel like i have to put this"
243237,maybe we need to make germany great again?
243258,"man, this game has inevitable bugs, what a shit company riot is"
243377,maybe your keyboard is throwing
243433,cause games are the only way to procrastinate on the computer...

243614,"oh, but the apple app store is way more secure than google play, you never see scammy or malicious apps!"
243673,should've been $40 like ultimate alliance
243748,they need the supply drop money to feed there families.
243775,cheaters dont deserve 128tick anyways.
243839,"it isn't about what *you* see, it's about showing off to other people."
243875,"too bad the envy signatures are on there, otherwise it could have been worth a lot ."
243980,ye because vayne tier scaling with renektons tier dmg early game was completely fine
244197,yeah fuck these people for trying to have some fun in their life
244315,"naw man its obvious he is more knowledgeable, he definitely knows balance."

244407,"dopa back to elo-boosting, i guess."

244707,vlad and viktor are so fun to watch
244747,"yeah, it's kinda sad that reddit made me oblivious to jokes if they don't end with"
244785,yeah because blizzard hasn't and can't create new lore!
244814,what if your internet was fine and u were just being ddos'ed the whole time..
244867,"yes, because downgrading is such a great long-term solution."
244877,costs extra to import digital downloads
244890,"no way he just said that, wow, big news boys, valve does what valve wants to its best interest !"
244911,because it's a goddamn dirty omnic!
244924,not shroood so it doesn't matter
244945,oh yea only a 75% pick in the pros and a balance buff to his ult meter...completely useless after the nerfs.
244991,opinions are only valid if they agree with mine
245021,"right, and smash players should stop wavedashing; just run to where you need to be ahead of time!"
245047,"i'd be a pro player if i cheated, but i don't, so i'll comment about all the people who are better than me as cheaters on reddit and score some massive karma!"
245061,because garena is a lot better than riot
245117,yeah dude pretty sure a 4 year old could do it
245129,yeah watching that video you can clearly see how immobile and easy to hit genji is now.
245179,but i thought you didn't use math once you're out of highschool?
245200,"that is really frustrating, obviously the sound of that m4 is nothing compared to the sound of that pistol.might need to change the m4 sound."
245253,wow okay it's totally fine then
245302,doom is such a terribly optimized title.
245304,but does it compare to the size of no man's sky?
245337,agreed we have such a broken system and valve hates their own game rip csgo
245371,"yes, they should also stop interviewing people in english and instead start doing interviews in the players mother tongue, and have the casters do a 5 month language course for 20 languages so they can pronounce player names!"
245443,yeah im sure the us does none of that..
245510,aimbot doesn't need good ping...
245528,but i want to know that player xy jumped 38 times during the round or player ab bought 8 items
245530,because moe is arab and if you don't like him you must be a racist
245536,"i started maining weedwick when his win rate was 66%, it was total bullshit that they nerfed him again and again and again, so i totally stopped playing him because the nerfs were so unfair."
245560,"nope, claptrap is great, especially in the dlc where you go inside mind"
245627,"phew, wow, you really fucked with him."
245780,to pick dps heroes and yolo into the enemy to get potg regardless of obj obviously.
245799,no i expect everyone to be good at the game day 1 of public access.
245802,"oh no, someone can solo something that isn't relevant to them anymore because they've outgeared it by like 30 ilvls, oh the humanity!"
245810,you must have been carried you lucker dog.
245880,that's why wording matters so much if you want more karma
245895,"yeah, he was that guy that was always laying on the ground dead, right?"
245954,smh... battlefield copying cod by confirming a game with a emoji.
245979,ya finally quinn has the movespeed to roam effectively.
245986,stixxay worlds best adc though right?
245997,i sure wish i knew how to play a game where the only time i was having fun was by making other people feel small because i have shinier achievements than them
246013,while all the rich kids were playing oregon trail all the poors were playing gta iii and legend of zelda.
246025,yeah but it's not the new game!
246053,jensen is an eu mid so we can include him as well!
246146,i guess i will also buy myself a spot now.
246267,"oh look, winston is a monkey who likes peanut butter and banana, racist af."
246286,cause they are the only org that works with tournaments.
246299,yea it's not like they mentioned that the qss changes would buff zed and he most likely would need balance adjustments afterward.
246308,"no you dingus, the tall crazy brown hair dude from seinfeld!"
246328,but how will i show people how big my dick is if i'm not playing the class with the biggest numbers?
246343,"i found a fov scaling bug with soldier's sprint, games literally broken"
246358,so they're just gonna 4v5 everyone lol
246361,"yep, garbage, just leave him in the bin on the way out next to galio."
246389,because criminals and lunatics respect gun freeze zones
246439,"but it must be the best kind of intro, because it's exactly like the intro used by almost every minecraft youtuber ever!"
246471,clearly you got lost...let me get you directions back to dota ;)
246478,no it only works with flashlight of a phone
246521,"and yet it is, strange how people are able to change their minds"
246610,no a major studio release will never be available on dvd in the future.
246714,oh yea im actually thinking that they will raise the salary to 5 million/year per player like in football because... reasons
246731,but wolf only ranked support though.
246817,yeah let's do that before warwick or yorick
246825,"lol red is for suckers, i only bet odd numbers."
246826,"yeah who cares if you can get shot by someone while they're completely behind cover, totally not a big deal."
246828,changed the title for those whos braintumor doesnt allow to understand
246838,right... because the new nuke is everything the community asked for
246878,"yeah, that's why the new nuke is loved by everyone in this subreddit."
246883,"lets pretend like all the fnatic fans knew huni and ro would be amazing, you guys knew the whole time!"
246980,"thanks for your beautifully structured answer, i will be sure to take it into consideration"
247002,"you're not thinking about the cloud, bruh."
247031,"wow, this is completely out of the blue and not at all expected."
247035,it's been far too long since a col roster change
247072,"we do get *one* song from wow in the movie... [the vanilla wow login music plays at the credits, apparently.]"
247108,would be funny if you get banned for not grouping.
247111,nah everyone should just do it good the first time or not try at all
247144,"you didn't get gud, you are just playing kindred"
247155,"it does have a cooldown, it's called reload."
247174,"fucking shills, couple of casual normies ^^^reee"
247189,"well his 50% dmg boost is too strong, blizz pls nerf omg"
247224,"i know it may seem hard at first, but i then learned that i can buy things i want and not buy what i don't."
247230,but... but it's an esport already
247297,the technology just isn't there yet
247301,but with dynamic queue you can just carry him to gold.
247305,yeah guys lets fucking nerf bloodthirster and botrk even more hell yeah!
247320,"idk man, na did carry eu in ww2"
247351,yea lets go back to last season where it was impossible to boost.
247352,"yes, c9 stopping others from qualifying is really good."
247358,"fuck the k/d ratio, its about the w/l ratio :p"
247381,na cs so bad they even have worse maps than eu.
247428,but the enemies are all at their base and i need to rack up more killz!
247442,"naw man, sports are for stupid people."
247457,have you ever seen someone rage in solo queue this season?
247465,this poll would be better if it had rng invovled.
247472,what's the point of even trying if we will just lose to koreans
247512,"no one plays overwatch, he shouldn't bother"
247590,held* bastion at least takes a little skill
247599,it... it's almost like they modeled the dog in the game after a real dog...
247609,"yeah, who needs an overlay when you can just spend more money on a second monitor just to chat"
247628,"[medivh was corrupted by sageras's spirit way before his birth and when medivh died, sargeras's spirit tried to take control of his body]"
247672,"well what can i say, inflation is a bitch :x"
247681,nah man you have to work around the bug ur just an idiot for not releasing realising that
247767,i was expecting a full game with a love story tragedy and a plot twist that would make me remember for decades.
247772,calling it now: spanish flu dlc incoming.
247798,your fault for not killing him noob
247805,how can you say that you are not trying to be offensive when your comment was like reaally offensive?
247809,etc didn't have an i in it at all.
247815,"you're silver 1, you wouldn't understand"
247817,"hey, that yee lmao hasn't mentioned roca but he is probably cheating too!"
247821,because the ps4 is ohh so quiet..
247844,"the at least changed the name of the riot pls list and made it shorter, so they definitely want to improve"
247856,nip like to keep the bloodline pure thats why they got rid of allu
247888,i have no idea why you would think r/overwatch would enjoy this.
247921,yeah cause every departments works on the same thing amirite?
247933,inb4 sean went to echo to get away from n0thing
247954,"yeah but that's what men want, a fantasy where you're a shirtless, muscled badass"
247968,"shit, and here i thought it meant that it was time to push ahead by myself as reaper, and then it gave me permission to demand heals."
248010,that was sarcasm... but i guess people are too young on this sub to understand that... my bad next time i will do
248029,"damn, then riot will ban those who opt out"
248041,"yes, i totally wanna get in touch with this community"
248056,"op said summer, not the whole year"
248140,"partial genocide of jews, conquering nations and countries, arising a world threatening army-- yeah totally easy being worse than hitler"
248143,"dude, he's like 9 give him a break"
248176,"yes and that shows really well here, you act like a mature adult that has his life together"
248178,"look at counter strike, there's first bullet in accuracy and every loves it."
248192,why would monte want to be like krepo?
248195,"valve thinks we need more rng in the game, they should just change the cocking time to a random float between 1 and 2 seconds."
248203,this better be how good skyrim remastered looks
248206,but aren't they all kids who've already had sex with my mom
248236,"well actually, if you take away the votes from fucking old uneducated racist scum who won't live to see the effects of their vote, then remain actually won."
248267,yellowstar is not a superstar either
248280,"[just so you know, the titan's are basically dead, and only their spirits are alive.]"
248286,"yeah but ethics, journalism, patriarchy, xenophobia, and you're probably a racist too"
248305,and every time i go for a cs it levels up and i miss my last-hit.
248371,"wow, i didn't know they played the game too"
248398,i really love her hhmmm and yeah while someone else is talking on the analyst desk
248449,yeah thats why steam is broken.
248452,fnx with the 1 awp kill from saving
248464,he would be unbanned as soon as valve releases left for dead 3
248475,confirmed all dragon lore users are bad with the awp
248519,what do you mean they're all from na
248556,this must be why noone ever complains about leavers causing losses in tf2.
248622,now stand conspicuously outside a police station with it on.
248665,"well, i guess you dropped this then:"
248690,oh look this is first time i see this gif on reddit.
248806,"yes, i definitely left the games **on purpose** :\^)."
248812,but he's got gold medal damage.
248817,i'm sure the kind of friends worth making are just like him.
249054,that series must be brimming with originality.
249530,"but niko buys a deagle on pistol round, so he has t do it too"
249538,jokes on you when i multibox bastion on pc
250295,"you guys only have a 75% winrate, git gud."
250802,yeah i mean they should definitely wait until season 2 to fix this because if we don't give it time they wont be able to figure out whether this is the right way to handle this...
250868,hes gotta get time to toggle somehow
250948,but the overload (2) makes it balanced
251304,"yep, i miss watching the epic way the cts masterfully throw their smokes onto chokepoints."
251499,"yeah seeing all those old wrinkly people, that sure sounds great."
251597,"i mean, if there was a spell to change your race, don't you think there wouldn't be any black wizards?"
251728,is this the video of you playing with 512x512?
251993,oh no not teamwork in a team game!
252059,dude you are being so toxic right now...
252074,maybe league has less viewbots now too
252137,because nintendo can never do anything wrong of course.
252339,but you are wrong and should feel bad and feel like a victim of sexual assault by your parents.
252478,reddit: where sarcasm can't be used without
252615,tarik to join the ibp boyz for match fixing?
252662,"wow, i've never seen this before!"
252703,they gave us a $15 discount what's wrong with you
252705,it seems the guys was right and didn't need to delete the fake posts.
252742,because people can't say his name right
252765,"the same $ taken away and possible jail time, hope its worth"
252962,im basically global because crossfire was my 1.6.
253115,"so s1mple is cheating as well, no suprise to me"
253173,"nah bro, approximately 800,000 people out of the millions upon millions of people who play this game on a regular basis...we're such a good sample to take their data from."
253278,"i'm pretty sure that the nes classic will be able to maintain 60fps , so therefore it's better than the xbone, and the ps4!"
253376,"yes, i will support this developers shitty attitude by buying payday 2 a second time on another platform just to get it to work"
253386,"dam, i wish i was as good as you at this game."
253452,"yeah definitely agree, i mean look at splyce and how trash they are..."
253663,assuming someone like zyra isn't basically nude
253691,yet their still the best and do no wrong
253715,damn dardoch back at it again with the toxicity..
253778,im actually offended by the fact that she is asian washing.

253914,yes please make a useless hero even more useless by giving a sniper damagedropoff
253998,dude cmon its not their bad he is a bit slow
253999,he isn't elo boosting he is just using dynamic queue
254138,cause lebron is wearing a rockets jersey
254225,* zika and flesh-eating viruses on the loose * lawlessness due to police taking a break * olympic village basically uninhabitable * poor people being displaced * lake where the water events take place polluted to hell 10/10 would do over again xdxdxdxdxdxd
254232,yeah fuck riot it would be the best if we only had 5 man korean teams everywhere soon
254291,if we buy enough loot boxes if we could sue the banned people!
254300,this site is full of reputable information
254355,"but at least you can customize your character..that makes it worth it, right?"
254376,this game seems like a shit copy of lucio ball imo
254455,isai could be the best melee player in the world if he tried
254510,"well, to be fair you did suck, you couldn't win 4v6, what are you some kind of noob?"
254526,it's already in dota so they wont implement it
254536,nothing like a hard fought round where you win with less than 10 seconds left only to lose the next round in one single push
254576,"well, if you're not shouting yar har fiddle de dee and bustin' caps with your offhand bb gun, and throwing cannon ball z are you *really* living the rogue dream?"
254692,no in legiom you have to choose 1 specc which you have to play forever without being allowed to play another specc
254729,so you're saying we should get disney to make the next warcraft movie for kids?
254827,valve servers are always taking a dump
254911,"yeah, i would rather havethat riot would give 20 mil to the already top teams compared to the shit system lol has where they provide funds and chances to cs tier 2 teams and salery for the bottom of the league teams"
254913,why don't you complain the artist who built that world?
254925,it'll happen at the same time as the modding api.
254960,"guys, i been playing nintendo since the game cube and this meme is ancient"
255016,but fans told me they were building the pc version and then porting to ps4... surely they cannot be wrong!
255045,so i found this site lolottlo no the owner or anything but gamble there lol
255052,"but you cant see other players, worst game ever"
255111,"i enjoy the new theme, you guys are just being babies."
255139,he started leaving his game open so redditors couldn't complain about his lack of hours
255142,sick roast right here apply cold ice to the burn sold for a price higher than griknot's self esteem... $3
255200,but what are they going to add to the ps4s v2.13 if they allowed all the old features present in last gen to be available now?
255221,esl just needs more time to find out how to get 3 former fnatic members into pro league
255269,if i can't have every skin for free the game is trash and should be treated as such.
255328,wonder why don't they sell them as a box with random t-shirt
255332,"yes, let's remove every play style that we don't like or agree with, that will be healthy for the meta and attract a more diverse player base."
255365,"the whole premise of deus ex is to fight the illuminati, so makes sense for media not to mention it."
255386,[lich king is the leader of the death knights in the legion]
255425,definitely not used over 9000 times previously
255426,well it shouldn't really matter because of favor the shooter right?
255438,yes they should just give shit away for free instead
255445,ive got top damage and elims as hanzo so you switch
255530,that high dmg team comp with 3 infernal drakes definitely scripted
255531,persona 4 has it's own controllers?
255547,you can play on consols but i wouldnt call that competitive
255555,"fencer here, and no one swings on their left, that's why we call crab walk to make sure you're on the right side.."
255560,those games where s1mple bottom fragged en route to the finals liquid just fell apart because no one else could carry the weight.
255563,noo don't forget they nerfed symmetra's turret damage
255639,"it's clearly because they are super old, you can tell because they also have hunchbacks.."
255672,tryndamere: if monte cares so much about casters getting payed why doesn't he give them money from his pool of money from casting league of legenderios.
255712,if you want victorious skin that badly just pay for boost in the first place.
255721,i know right this is clearly alliance bias by blizzard!
255741,won't play until fixed... outraged!
255746,no we say lit haven't you learned already
255891,"why on earth would they do that, when they have things like video games to distract them and comforts beyond imagination?"
255903,i'm pretty sure they just reduce your damage if you're doing well
255931,"no, that would ruin the player and crowd interaction"
255939,"yeah, but he put it in quotes so it doesn't count."
255947,"but muh na midlaner, he's just as good as all the imports, hes most consistent, he doesn't get carrried by the koreans"
255973,because there isn't totally a free level 100 boost for buying the game or anything
255991,bjergsen and doublelift are the best players in the west by far
256033,"yeah, because if there's a takeaway from this past weekend of games it's that perkz looks stronger than bjerg/double."
256088,"because if the graphics aren't top notch, the game is garbage."
256113,"no, he invests league money into other games, sub optimal owner."
256159,nuke update ... almost forgot about this awesome addition
256166,"oh that's why, it's on the ps4!"
256313,but brah everyone knows the reason why everyone isnt one tapping is due to first shot inaccuracy which sg barely has
256318,but krepo should talk more about the free tower trade every game!
256328,"yeah, because cod is always struggling for good sales."
256336,shame you aren't a fan of a better game...
256355,that guy that wants to gank for you until you're 0/3 at 6 mins and would only cause a double kill if he ganked at that point.
256365,orange shank gank plank gang useless
256370,yeah conditions only come from age not how you behave when you are young.
256404,"the bigger the hero, the less help they need to push the payload, right?"
256417,fiora was clearly a better player.
256447,"as a canadian, at least i have optic to repersent na cs !"
256495,"don't force gender stereotypes on game characters, man."
256574,"we must have really bad analysts then, because clg was clearly better than everyone else, before msi started."
256576,why do girls have to ruin everything.
256581,"yes, because the battlefield series defining features are realism and it's mature community"
256585,it's perfect for when you have girls over.
256603,"[tirion fordring, i have good news for you.]"
256619,"shhh we cant stand behind ea,what are we hypocrites?"
256627,i forgot you cant share your opinion on reddit
256646,i don't need them real titties if i can get my virtual ones.
256679,"but his glasses break, his vision's gotta get worse."
256689,"this is fake, none of these bastions turned around immediately and melted her in 0.2s"
256723,"why not make everything not one tappable, seems like a fair solution"
256736,yeah because people are buying uncharted strictly for the multiplayer
256741,"personally, i think he's talking about battlefront."
256745,i'm a kass main since season 2 and i don't think he needs buffs
256805,star wars battlefront 2 was released ten years ago!
256850,"what, you didnt love the blatant cheating ai at higher difficulties?"
256937,yeah his waveclear is so bad for example and farming is so hard!
256971,hey this is a our western kespa
257008,cause item/entity duplication is a feature.
257016,yes because the whole of reddit is centred around americans
257070,great news to anyone (including myself) who bought a 980ti in the past six months.
257079,"sure, and while we're at it let's make the self bleed never take you below 1 hp"
257122,"wesa regulation, they don't control their profiles anymore"
257152,"yeah i could play just like roca, just not trying hard enough"
257168,adjusting the speed of the aimlock to not snap too hard i think
257198,nah man bjerg just needs to firstpick zed every game and they will win worlds.
257213,what a hard struggle being able to make so many friends easily
257223,how much money did you pay to get the shaq on your youtube video?
257239,just use ignite and take your adc's kills
257242,yeah games without exoskeletons and jetpacks suck.
257253,can't wait to play xcom 2 on ps4!
257278,1v1 me minestrike metchmeker men)))
257284,"but they main widow, so they can't change."
257307,"you guys are on vacation, no need for ip boost."
257351,gz you're probably the first one coming up with that theory!
257361,"since they changed fid's passive, they needed a new champ to hold the title of worst passive."
257391,"yeah, why would anyone enjoy rewards and extra levels of customization or sharing exclusive experiences with the world at large?"
257410,worse blizzard release since warlords of draenor
257436,"no, the rarity of the skin is a seeded rng, basically, the cooler the skin the likelier it is to have a high rarity, but it's very possible to get a really cool skin with shitty rarity, such is the way of things, unfortunately."
257440,why would i build sightstone it gives me no fucking ap?
257459,use steams amazing in game music feature
257488,"no, making reddit post takes less effort"
257499,"i'm sure there's no right way to both getting it right and doing it promptly, i mean it's not like other companies managed to do it before."
257603,considering the saints in the community he definitely should be embarrassed.
257608,"we smart, we loyal, we make deals and pussy out ..."
257614,but you can just play normals together!
257616,i didn't know they had an omnic crisis campaign
257671,guess being the most 1337 h can only hide you for so long.
257692,they should just whine on youtube comments like we all do.
257697,"yeah, definitely keep adren since he's doing so much better with igling and fragging now..."
257702,"well if they go the c9 way of developing talent, this might up as dyrus, theoddone, regi, gleeb and chaox."
257725,"my god, it's a cylinder-shaped *neck massager*, what heathen would use it for such a thing?"
257730,i know thats why the top support in the world like mata and gorilla are playing ranged support now.
257777,"yeah for sure, because of the shitstorm riot caused this week i know that ow won't have any toxic premades"

268383,but all the surveys say that ppl are really happy with the dynq.
268391,im a great player but my team keeps me down
268438,but snipers are the best for pushing the payload

275207,increasing the speed of rivens animation would make her balanced and also increase her play rate
275227,as tank i have an issue with this complaint and feel nothing would be solved
275230,but having xbox exclusives on pc will hurt the sales of the game on xbox
275231,that's quality content i don't know what you're talking about

275751,so that's where fnatic hides their cheats
275753,it's almost like blizzard is a business or something...
275876,"yeah, real diversity having 6 heroes that are the current meta with no space for the other 16."

276757,"yea, cause fuck genetics amirte?"
276780,"i have 61%, now this explains why we get a lot of dodgers.."

277010,we tend to forget those things we don't want to exist .
277075,because shoveling only uses the arm muscles
277077,this thread is just one big giant
277161,because it's ok for an adc to build assassin items and one shot a mid laner across the map but if rengar does it he is unhealthy for the game
277183,you cheated and you show is the demo after the game when you disabled cheats.
277191,wow stunning plays from the up and coming team huehue i look forward to seeing what they can do in the future
277195,faked rivalry's are so good tho

277446,it just doesn't feel right if all the information is available ingame and you don't have to use online resources to search it.
277527,but fiora used to be op so she must be easy to play
277579,...and oddjob fits better in smaller screens!
277623,not their fucking problem you don't have friends you lonely basement troll
277640,but i right click them and they still don't die
277657,ya its definitely the bots that ruined the game
277690,took him so long time to heal his cheats
277754,that's a really important issue...
277781,accurate af their name should be changed to energetic anal
277811,but the human eye can only see in 30fps...
277837,what if his player model isn't an edit but actual cheats
277853,i'm glad amazing content like this is totally fine while other more interesting stuff is removed because relevancy to the game
277869,yea he became really good all the sudden a couple days ago then somehow kept getting better.
277923,next time clean the cocaine leftovers at least
277960,the diverse angles from which i saw hanzo firing his q through a wall as potg
277972,he was clearly resisting arrest
277978,finally no more reasons to whiff on forklift guy !
277999,that one awkward day when you wore yoga pants to an esports event.
278009,yeah i think he must be really bad too
278019,annie is actually a 500 year old
278051,he named it after the achievement in wow.
278055,they'd probably get fined tho clg.br
278067,"uh, i'll have you know that faker is complete garbage at any champion he loses a game on, and if he loses where more than one game in a row he's tilted."
278102,pc gamers have proven themselves resilient to macro headwinds it's because of our immense body mass
278141,breaking news a silver 3 nip fangay gets destroyed by an incoming nip player
278145,"olof didn't play, doesn't count."
278154,you should post the exact same thing a 3rd time because people are clearly wrong and need to read you words.
278177,i'm a gold 5 support main but i could do what he did np
278185,i think that the weapons should backfire and hit the player right in the head when you jump and shoot at the same time.
278194,yeh because trick2g is a top tier player
278252,"[leading the horde or alliance, apparently.]"
278367,wow i haven't seen this idea before!
278406,"yeah, each sold over 20 million copies each, horrible numbers those.."
278449,i watched him shoot like 30 times and it did it every time.
278465,"haha yeah he should just give in to a stereotype that i'm not even sure exists, whatever it takes to convince my mom playing league all day is a viable career."
278558,clearly a kitten t-shirt and long hair on a boy is a gateway into drugs and hard partying.
278598,"*but guys, i thought nobody on xbox played japanese games*..."
278629,let hiko tk more he'll be happy.
278639,"just like disney is buying out critics for civil war, right?"
278712,because obviously you get essence by demonstrating your mastery with said champ
278766,this shit is why we need a wall.
278798,so what do they say if they're on the enemy team?
278810,nah man surely we need 2 mccrees and a genji on defence
278829,well american critics are way beyond hodors intellect.
278832,i guess it's true what they say about video games making people violent!
278857,"because when you're a flanking assassin, you should always announce when you teleport!"
278866,"as a mercy main, i can assure you that this is bad advice."
278896,there's this ukrainian kid that i hear is super friendly and an overall great teammate that would make your cs:go experience amazing!
278920,source 2 is just around the corner which will fix the issue.
278934,yeah but fuck the 1% because i am a bronze idiot who got boosted to silver by his 4 gold friends
278935,"roadhog is just thicc, he's a beautiful man and people clearly don't know what they're talking about if they think he's fat!"
278977,too bad his rank doesn't matter anymore cuz of dynamic queue
278984,"at ubisoft, cinematic experience is key to the game."
278992,yeah but they need to do it for purely altruistic reasons.
278993,and i'm pretty sure that's illegal in most places.
279017,i'm sure gamestop will start taking pre-orders next week.
279044,"well, if you want a case instead, i'm willing to trade."
279095,we don't need tanks or heals if we just keep killing the enemies
279151,we are the first of our kind to not have a minimap on a competative game.
279160,dude i get it america has guns but come on don't compare it to counter strike
279173,"completely, unredeemably unplayable..."
279262,"yes there's an extra e there,so its butnurnesze.it makes way more sense now"
279297,without the description i instantly thought that was a picture of a plane
279311,yeah bro but she has to scope in and *only* has a submachine gun if you get close to her
279319,"pfft, i'm already tanking.w with genji, duh."
279350,"0/10 misleading title, house not made of boats."
279354,"i paid $60 for this game if i wanan camp on attack and not play the objective i should be able to, who are you to tell me how the game should be played"
279393,that's the key to a great relationship!
279409,yes because mm is so competitive im really killing the careers of everyone
279416,"it's not a river, it's a lake with a current and a big island in the middle!"
279425,i heard blizzard was uninstalling these from people who've played more than 12h a day

279583,i'm so happy that's what we are now known for.
279604,"thanks valve, for fucking up the game once again"
279634,"cuz everything else in the game is obtainable irl, right?"
279635,gotta love how unbiased neogaf is.
279684,i forgot the only role to fill is support
279688,yeah it must suck to play on the beta servers
279705,yeah because the content last week was so much better.
279732,"hanzo/genji/reaper: always, because i am the only good one on my team."
279745,just learn the algorithm and anticipate it
279793,immortals be like: nah i dont like majors they are too mainstream
279848,noo man we cant get logic here dynamic queue divided lol in 2
279853,because your smiley faces are sooo much more proper and better at conveying your excitement.
279881,because the e key is never used by any other hero ever and learning to use it is pointless.
279934,i'm just so happy that i spent 150 bucks on one without a bluetooth feature!
279945,i thought zelda was that little green elf guy...

280161,this is completely new information that this subreddit didn't expect.
280170,apparently i really did need to add
280173,because valve gives them more attention than us
280196,99 out 100 vac bans are false positives.
280232,"it's obvious, nip got them to join the server to distract fnatic"
280302,"no, because they are already on the superior console."
280316,yeah but you were 3/4/13 not really that impressive when you consider that.
280319,dont you know that we are supposed to hate on gilius here?
280346,rude just means most people in the csgo community
280369,"yeah, he missed one shot, so i guess he's a scrub?"
280375,i am super offended and triggered from this game.
280386,i would leave too after that production quality
280673,"nah dude riot is either willfully ignorant or downright evil, dont you know runes that you cant even buy with real money make the game pay to win"
281007,7 years so when am i getting my $60
281394,thats sandbox mode and people will be toxic
281990,hero stacking is integral part of the game
281998,"well, i use the skin and i'm a guy so back off"
282187,especially the e particles are insane
282709,"salty nv fan, oh wait... fak too, total bs volvo pls fix."
282749,they must be hiding all the good pokemon in the station!
282886,why do you spray every time you shoot?
282901,thats probably because you play zenyatta!
282937,the sin of sloth is indeed a very serious business.
282955,i know that sega did a lot of drugs in the 90s.
283113,[it actually reveals a rare dreadlord in dalaran who you can then kill for oh resources and artifact power.]
283309,shen had sustain on q and a shield with 14 sec cooldown he didnt need mr
283401,"pretty sure that type of person would say that regardless of how much time you had on any character, he won that one fight so he's clearly better in every way."
283633,"don't worry, i'm sure they will release trophy capsules eventually"
283656,"yeah, but how has league been doing since the release of pokemon go?"
283714,"there is a difference between shitty and simply misunderstood, your unrefined peasant eye couldn't tell the difference between a shit post and the next van gogh."
283878,"well, that really showed me how wrong i am"
283989,try to aim next time and not hip fire like an idiot.
284118,it's your fault for not playing ingress~
284155,"genji is fine, nerf is not needed"
284207,o no the people who refuse to turn up the fov are at a disadvantage how could blizzard do this to them
284223,because playstation fanboys won't let us due to of 900p 30fps :(
284228,"shhh, you'll make them depressed."
284245,"i was annoyed when he missed that spray, then exuberant when he got 4 kills about 2 rounds later also!"
284377,"if you played all of that time, you're the sucker."
284450,"yea, because america is the only country with murder"
284667,guess we now know what happened to the rest of trumps hands... tracer stole them like she stole the jobs of hard working american overwatch members!
284669,the csgowild scandal didn't change your opinion?
284881,"gee, i cant wait till this sub is full of esports match discussions, and esports drama and the mods sign some nda with the devs."
284902,loved those intentional xpeke baits
284903,pretty sure rick fox was in that bathroom and coordinated keith and big to give tsm members details on a throw deal which he would pay for
285096,but the oldschool dev team is massive compared to riot.
285128,what are you saying we've deduced sombra is good at computers and likes to write in leet.
285210,"you're right, one bad game means he no longer has good mechanics"
285230,but whenever i talk i get a ban
285262,because bully champions aren't picked in a world where lane swap is possible.
285454,"nah, just run your hands through your hair a few times to get rid of charge buildup"
285505,"yes, its a great idea to make 1 tk a kickable offense."
285552,atleast 2015 fnc didn't lose to 5-12 team
285558,isn't that what zeus said to guardian
285579,my intel integrated hd 530 can run it on ultra
285608,the ability that gives me movement speed doesn't count!
285630,i'm really finding myself hating csgo because i can't buy a reasonably priced knife...
285636,"yea, because losing a bg before and getting only 50 honor was so much better..."
285644,"pls, if he would have been from eu he wouldnt have a personality hurrdurr"
285862,hackers might track me down if i give up too much information.
285877,"oh my god a single wire, the whole thing is complete shit now!"
285888,yeah but you're so entitled m8!
285898,"how very original, you are the first to make that joke"
285940,this ain't your mom's low orbit ion cannon!
286131,good play and all but i think torbjorn deserved it more
286139,you know.. adding creeps in cs go and pudge.
286212,u sure this isnt a full tank nauti montage?
286215,but...i thought nobody had a reason to buy an xbox one s with scorpio coming out next year?
286246,"the sounds are linked to your k/d, the better your k/d the more powerful the guns sound."
286268,finally my copy of cs:go will be able to access more than 4gb of ram.
286415,then i guess it's safe to say tsm will beat the tigers on the basis that they will fall apart at worlds because china did so last year
286436,"genji's lmb, genji's rmb, genji's shift, genji's e and genji's q."

286662,look like we need more threads right
286681,"but he's fine, he needs no changes."
286704,fucking 60 tick servers man they need to get it together and get 128 tick before the game is actually playable
286732,"i love having shitty awp movement, broken animations, nerfed rifles, head dinks etc."
286745,"i like playing games that weren't designed for ps4 with a ps4 controller such as no man's sky, the witcher 3, dark souls iii, etc..."
286766,no one was buying the character boosts
286767,because the game was so easy before that it was just a boring walk killing hopeless minions.
286833,yes because rules can never change
286851,oh no you can only jump twice what a distaster
286864,you don't think the chess event would be fun with 4 randoms?
286889,can't wait to augment my preorder!
286940,yes because africa is right next to germany this seems to be correct.
286943,how is a weasel on a glock disappointing?
286947,he should just get a new account
287020,nah mate you make maps for csgo you must be an entitled 12 year old
287032,i'm sure valve will retract the awp nerf any day now.
287041,"nah if he really wanted it, he'd find some dicks to suck behind walmart"
287044,tarik must've seen their new csgo house tour.
287056,she doesn't do any damage so she's useless
287062,because riot wants the same experience in ranked and proffessional play those banners make it so uncomfortable to watch proffessional play as a ranked player
287072,because they prefer to use denuvo.
287103,"as a gnar vs gp , that clearly shows darshan is the better ..."
287108,"ah, it all makes perfect sense now"
287171,"maybe if junkrat is crouching as he does his ultimate , his tires footsteps become quiet"
287189,i'd prefer a playstation foursie
287211,\*ahem\* i'll have you know i main dps mercy
287273,sure haven't seen this joke before.
287310,lul 2016 someone plays league lul
287350,inb4 valve makes a crossover attempt with overwatch to say that all the characters in their game are part of the soldier enhancement program from overwatch and that's why they're so fast.
287392,yes clearly when two enemies are standing still but you still miss its obv the internet to blame
287401,but csgo is the only game with hitreg issues
287434,but the human eye can only see 20fps
287450,"yeah, it'll take a mortal reminder"
287454,"oooh so that's why melee animation cancel got nerfed, so that genji can easily sheathe it once it stops wobbling"
287458,"haha, it's all about efficiency"
287488,hanzo is the reason jeff left the hero deletion door open in that interview
287515,there is no such thing as luck with hanzo
287519,are we supposed to read more than the title?
287532,looks like jin air decided to have a bad day today as well
287559,"yeah man, every time janna wins a game i feel totally cheated and felt as if janna was way too strong."
287586,nah man little black drones and giant vibrant blue arrows are exactly the same!
287592,"can't we just cut the bullshit and force everyone in qp to always play rein, zarya, lucio, zen, mccree and whatever flavor of the month character gets the 6th comp spot?"
287600,oh that's the easter egg following 'the last bastion'
287624,i'm global i just choose not to rank up
287657,"yeah, not like holding mouse 1 with 120 dps is hard at all."
287661,"lcs in canary islands, san marino or malta."
287702,if you can play offline multiplayer why would you pay the hostage fee for online access?
287751,yeah those late game 300 hp every 6 secs if he is at 10% hp out of 3k hp seems op
287754,is that a sick edit or just standard 4:3?
287811,all you have to say is that you previously owned the games you have back up files
287830,"if only tsm had qualified, then bjergsen would be !"
287887,because dumb americans don't understand ties
287909,"serbs, croats, what's the difference"
287917,"yeah, shit, damn her for being female!"
287953,"just like kinect then, i'm sure hololens 2 will be better"
287959,"adc's also have hp and armour per level, therefore they're tanks, right?"
287967,"yeah, q+flash/e through minions doesn't exist"
287981,any chance you get your hands on the cologne 2015 team povs?
287992,"sure is greating running the same content for a year, especially when you have all these both same expac raids to fall back on!"
288000,so reddit has to not pertain to real life in anyway?
288036,nintendo is totally nsa (nintendo's spy agency!)
288067,you mean you don't want to see the crowd in the middle of a team fight?
288078,yes because we live in north korea where players have to listen to management or else they get fired.
288079,"yea man, when a team replaces 4 members its for sure gonna fail..."
288093,"yes, because measuring players against one another while they are being in different teams, regions and roles while also pulling off a *team* game is going to be so accurate."
288106,"fuck rito, a company should not hold any power over it's own product"
288184,"espanola epinatas, they were top in their conference last trimester."
288189,"skarner 2nd highest win rate, galio 3rd highest, obviously needs nerfs"
288254,are you just pretty tall or are all of them the size of a bunch of hobbits?
288271,how dare you undervalue sjokz lol opinions...
288292,as an omnic main i find this comment racist.
288313,so then why do i consistently play vs high gold and plat players in silver but dont rank up
288332,combines my two favorite things: smug superiority and comparing myself to nazis
288418,"surefour will easily grab $10k, because he is a very skilled player"
288425,nice walls knowing the last guy was in palace
288427,you were clearly hitting his legs.
288444,yeah sure only americans follow eu lcs (or lcs in general for that matter)
288461,"yeah, this is also why smash bros never took off"
288479,i dont see the difference to the version i played on my xbox 360
288480,yep valve is a perfect ethical cooperation
288519,i think scarra's ward is one of the most advanced and important moves in the game.
288531,"but azir doesn't need a nerf, he's never picked because he is always banned!"
288532,"false, evem though his team lost, s1mple wins because his hltv rating was above 1.0"
288565,because none of those things exist in real life.
288575,"yeah, forgiven is such a great team player"
288579,"but i thought hybrid was trying out for tsm, surely that means he's in tsm alrdy"
288599,oh look a totally non-biased review for a game!
288655,well technically it's a sport for some
288702,that all seems pretty groundbreaking.
288755,maybe he wanted it to combine with a
288764,"that already exists, stattrack ak-47 cartel"
288795,wow can't believe you didn't save for half time
288810,was recently added a treant hero in the game
288814,it's almost like they used the same idea from hearthstone.
288830,saving this to repost on valentine's day 2017.
288841,at least someone told him to kill himself
288885,"nah, people who play games don't leave the house."
288904,i think league is making me doing enough math already when i try to add up the cost of my items what to see what i can buy.
288971,but why play dominion when you can just play overwatch?
288985,those matches were so fun to watch
288988,"wait, he doesn't already do that?"
288995,"eh, you aren't the real america though."
289010,because players can't perform badly on almost winning teams.
289055,but his stun isn't fair it kills you without you being able to do anything
289056,upload your porn to a cloud server.
289137,"dupes only get you 1/5 of the original price, which means i can just afford an epic skin from both drops, gr8 trade"
289147,runic echos for that sweet movement speed.
289152,"has nothing to do with roster changes at all , james is the biggest god in cs history."
289156,"because lol is exactly like starcraft/ow/cs:go/dota and theyll definitely be at the top of those games too, since after all pro competetive games are identical to one another and all, totally making it a stable financial decision for them to make"
289163,"the don't make mistakes, they just fuck up about communicating with the playerbase."
289177,"yeah, because this whole situation is about me."
289179,"well, duh, you suck ass unless you get all five golds"
289198,then you'll be right at home with the ops setup!
289228,"yeah, 'cause nothing can possibly be done in an extra .6 sec that might save your life or the life of your teammate."
289238,the human eye can only see 24 ticks per second
289284,"stealing overwatch ideas, how original"
289302,"maybe it is a fair comparison, maybe it's a comparison between a $350 ps4 and a computer built for $350 (including m/kb)."
289303,no clearly the fan remake will have enough money to fight a legal battle with disney
289346,psssh they only won *starladder* buddy come on anyone on this sub could do that
289368,omg the best team is winning thats so booring man .. the team with the highest level of play is winning .. we can't allow that
289417,"none of them would ever rage, especially not flamie"
289422,ever since he (and niko) joimed mouz they started winning!
289447,maybe your friends are trying to tell you something
289488,yeah this is the 42nd stack mf qs on baron to 1-shot it video i've seen this week.
289511,imo every team comp should have at least three winstons.
289524,"yea pasha has gotten so old now, esl gotta step up their game..."
289528,but then how can we ask to get the address of the run it down mid player from last game?
289539,who still plays call of duty lol
289554,hey screw you for wanting new games!
289580,"if it's not the highest settings, with at least three graphical enhancement mods, then it's garbage!"
289615,and an active penalty would totally stop them from trolling.
289631,i hear there's already controversy about the mission where you shoot archduke franz ferdinand.
289651,"well imt is the second best team in the world , so tsm dropping a game against them is not a big deal"
289653,time for him to stream under the game legend1
289654,"it's simple, skt is just sandbagging"
289676,for the amount of bullets he's catching.. tank ain't that bad a guess :p
289696,this is still koosta just talking shit
289713,but bending at the waist to put a game in is nostalgic.
289717,oh they are announcing gta5 for wii u tomorrow.
289793,"listen buddy, there's no 'team' in 'one man apocalypse'"
289802,"no, that's just the ultimate team"
289814,i hope it's another free avatar shirt.
289833,better refund that boosted account
289862,would never happen would increase toxicity
289880,"nice advice, i think you should give it to competitive pros as well.."
289882,but i bought a lot of stuff from a russian guy in a back alley and never had a problem.
289907,"its his highlight, the title is"
289935,it's because meteos told riot that you are toxic - and ya' know riot doesn't support toxic players so you have no right in the community
289950,god i can't wait till this game
289982,"it's super hard to count to 2,3, or 4."
289986,lift your mouse when you are hovering over enemy players through walls.
289999,yea cause we should all have every cosmetic that we want/is in the game a month after release
290026,someone else will push i need to get kills
290045,"lets make a sniper for our fps that focuses on close(ish)-range fights sure thing, let's make her a decent close-range fighter too, in addition to being the only hero who can reliably fight long-ranged combat i dont see anything wrong with that leaked blizz dev talk about widowmaker brainstorming"
290169,"it's called gold nova master, learn 2 play scroob"
290188,"pc masterful race calling in ( via telecom), we had this 10 years before nintendo even announced it"
290254,the same way dailymotion is perfectly fine video site right now
290289,because obviously steve has orchestrated this huge cover-up to prevent anyone from finding out that piglet is being abused and the entire team hates him
290313,"he should also be able to triple jump, teleport and always have his ult up"
290329,"maybe they're going the mgs twin snakes route, and adding bullet time cutscenes."
290337,"yeah, every time i use my microphone i get called out for being a guy."
290341,look on the bright side they got 14 round vs lowandlions
290390,data show that they are right though.
290398,"i mean trash talk is pretty toxic, aphro should probably get banned for this"
290486,"i can't wait to play against hecarim, sona, ezreal and nidalee all the time!"
290496,i miss the days when shaco just placed 5 boxes at red and then went to the lane he wanted to gank at level 2 because 5 boxes instakilled the camp
290533,we don't want kikoo cod player on this awesome game ...
290562,i might actually respect skyrim again if ulfric becomes president.
290589,"yea, because you can use point and click abilities vs the sweepers shadows."
290603,yes it reminds me of that other game where you hit things with a hammer and paint comes out.
290644,"thanks for mobile link, it really loads well on a desktop browser."
290684,your post history instills me with confidence.
290857,why is nip at the start of it?
290862,haven't you heard of the term mad doctor before?
291040,there was a story in the original titanfall?
291386,yeah please we should ban people for playing in a group they kill my solo enjoyment and i mean multiplayer competitive games are made for playing solo q so why does blizzard even force me to play in a group?
291387,"make it at least so only silvers+ can queue for competitive, thats only 501 levels and people might be knowing how to play at least 1 character somewhat ok by now..."
291866,wow good thing inferno is in the competitive pool
292284,nintendo targets 11 year olds which is a time when girls tend to be taller than boys.
292494,10/10 did not expect wall joke when reading the title
292585,you don't have many friends do you m8?
292869,"this is my curse, as in his curse is having to play with such bad teammates which are the cause of his death."
293356,where are the outrages that there are no women or non-white males in the group?
293536,nah he's gonna throw it at bethesda because of fallout 4
293668,"what you dont like rito pls, dynamic queue ,sphaghetti ,going to overwatch and sandbox"
293813,"yeah, cuz that's how it worked in s3."
293944,cause that seems like a financially smart decision.
293982,"i don't think this would fit into overwatch, since it isn't a stereotype/copy of something and is actually original character."
294012,because obviously microtransactions are the future
294073,how about instead of the usual bo3 we have a bo2 and if it ties we have a decider map!
294343,how about a feature that would allow players to just tell everything 5 times faster with voice!
294475,"go play source or 1.6, lots of skins there"
294514,because nintendo wants to give sony and microsoft a chance.
294637,"twitch chat is a great way to judge a community, all other games are super respectful in chat"
294799,the feature blizz added in cara but was removed due to no one using it
294811,"ah yes but they have 30+ buttons, it's not pressing them that matters, just having them."
294874,you are so bad your team loses immediately when you join.
294912,some spoilers included in patch notes [king anduin replacing wrynn and high overlord saurfang replacing vol'jin]
294921,"its too bad the ps4 version isn't as cinematic, being 60fps and all."
294942,"oh shit, the new patch could have added a sneak peak at one of the monitors in hollywood."
295023,"yea, just copy what kennys and jw did in their prime and you should be fine"
295121,"hey bruh, we are at war with fucking sjws, we dont have time to think calmly,"
295222,"don't blame you, usually people do"
295279,looks like i am joining na'vi' guys.
295294,and of course reddit users are the only people to buy video games
295476,skins should be reworked again its like rito isnt even trying
295514,yeah how dare they reward a mid range and quite thin skill shot you should try vsing a blitzcrank if you think illaois e is bad
295574,both pale in comparison to hai's jungling.
295649,"there's no way there could ever be 4,000 people in the country/world that would want to attend this live"
295675,his name is isn't firelady225s now is it
295795,the post says least favorite not your favorite
295827,"i have 2 of them stacked, more consistency.."
295860,"i gotta hand it to him, his coding stands up to the pressure everytime."
295878,it's as if there wasn't a thread or two about the time change announcements from redditors during the weeks of the time change this year.
295884,no but windows 10 is the best nobody ever has problems with it
295945,"i once played a pug with hiko, pretty much confirmed to liquid"
295946,"nah man, he has cheats for nades as well"
295987,yeah every good player that isn't on tsm is overrated honestly
295990,and all statements are 100% true too.
296117,playing pacman has been proven to teach you how to play against a fed malzahar
296140,can't wait to never be able to mog combat weapons into fist weapons.
296153,a speed run where they know where everything is on a certain seed that sounds real interesting and much more impressive
296183,yes and s1mple doesn't deserve anything bc he is savior of na
296213,"yeah, i'm sure the developers are there for peanuts &amp; free video games, it's such a non-competitive industry that they **have to** stick with ubisoft."
296217,"yes, because one kid can really represent a whole country."
296234,they did it to match their overwatch sensitivity
296330,should be really hard to find someone to offer to make one of the most iconic games in history
296331,maybe he didn't understand german
296424,"hell, [a draenei rogue is pretty important to the subtlety artifact quest.]"
296489,can some one make a video that has all of them
296546,nah i'm playing mine with it floating.
296570,"valve can't count to three, remember?"
296628,spoiler: [he gets his throat cut apparently.]
296643,that's still not 100% evidence bro
296671,shahzam is the best awper in na
296675,"i'm rank 27, why haven't i received a letter though i'm better than everyone else in my team"
296712,"wow, i'm so glad people who don't pay can now play."
296723,yeah you just need some ***really*** advanced cheats hack valves server to change the serverside calculated spread
296747,8gb is all you will ever need forever!
296772,stewie would never play with that online asian piece of shit
296774,"ah right, because if someone else flames first it's completely fine to flame back!"
296814,i think that kind of ability is useless since my team is basically deaf anyway :(
296845,this will be great for bitcoin!
296860,"that will be two gold please, one for the flair and one for all the bitches you will be picking up with that flair."
296879,"no, they're going to remove them next snapshot."
296880,but the human eye can only see in 30fps
296907,"i want to see whoever was in charge of this sacked at ign, this is a atrocity"
296939,females are just inferior gamers; except it.
296977,the free righteous glory as an adc against kled braum and malphite is amazing
296979,everyone knows system 32 is a virus!
296980,maybe that's why he's such a piece of shit!
296990,because it's fun to poke fun at colorblind people.
297012,"okey, i think this is fastest bo5 ever"
297205,"because pros are never wrong, nor have knee-jerk reactions, nor jump on bandwagons as badly as the rest of this stupid community."
297223,at least there are still delays
297268,"yeah, lets keep bitching and being annoying even tho they listened to criticism and improved!"
297278,yeah because the pros turned this piece of shit game made by hidden path into the playable competitive shooter we have now.
297333,but then i can't tell the devs how they're ruining the game and it's all their fault and only i can fix it.
297364,cant you just run dx12tovulkan.exe
297376,"i dunno man, origen didn't do that well in spring but spring doesn't matter anyway remember?"
297398,played in lck finals = bad champion
297406,but how do you know what button is which?
297442,"ah yes, bjergsen's aurelian sol, well known and feared across multiple regions"
297524,"i'll stick to my stinking poop pipes, thank you very much!"
297528,"a company creates a successful business model for themselves, we should be thankful!"
297559,clearly she has adhd because she giggles uncontrollably and is not serious

297593,and a very elaborate opinion at that.
297619,i hope it doesn't take that long
297702,you could have downloaded a hi-res photo and stared at that for an hour if that's all you wanted
297704,everyone lnows everything on the internet is 100% true
297706,downvoted because not pc player
297726,i really hope that other teams understand how tsm works and end up adapting/applying that to their own players so that we can finally see higher levels of competition.
297732,i have 0 rp get wrekt scrub lol
297742,maybe they were only using 1 sig fig and had to round up?
297746,no sir your opinion is wrong...and that is a fact!
297753,thats what you get for being a goblin
297801,but they took away huhi's champion pool!
297805,"shhh, he's too cool to know the name"
297826,gotta hand it to you...that logic is pretty flawless
297874,fuck you and your apexis crystals.
297884,pretty sure i watched him lvling an account a month or 2 ago he is a quick learner nice draven
297929,"yeah, the 1200 queue was not an indicator"
297988,"dude, you cant say that black people smell, thats racist..."
298012,if it doesn't do well in japan it doesn't matter anywhere else.
298041,bitcoin mining with their client
298048,"gasp, my lungs, this was so funny i cannot breathe...wheeeze."
298121,"yes, that's *totally* what happens in hots."
298195,i won a game vs zed without qss ama
298225,yeah i guess nobody should comment because this isn't an appropriate place for speculation and reaction to the latest patch.
298237,no dude the first 48 hours of the game will dictate the entire future!
298258,"just had a game 3 ocean's in a row and they got all of them at 20mins, it was fun"
298318,not enough drones flying around?
298430,"don't ruin the circlejerk, stixxay is one of the best adc's in the world"
298431,naw bro everyone is obviously just playing him because he's so fun to play
298432,...you mean i can't just play roadhead each game all game and hook some bitches?
298452,is that a new item or something?
298467,i thought pcs were way cheaper and more cost effective than consoles.
298570,mega zubat and mega entei confirmed
298590,so many less cheaters now that i'm playing in prime.
298603,evolve did the same thing and was a smashing success!
298634,"this was an upset, everyone knows fnatic are shit now"
298644,it's out on my birthday :) someone here should by it for me.
298669,"oh but if owners of renegade are above profiteering and are 100% for player interests like badawi said, selling at a lower price should be no issue at all!"
298681,"try countering bastion as hanzo, genji, or widowmaker!"
298845,yeah this snoopeh guy seems like an outgoing big persona ego
298951,and that's why you are less skilled
299067,rekkles is just an mg scrub :')
299081,be a waste of time as the human eye can't see above 1080p/30fps anyway
299093,its obviously about all the frozen wow accounts waiting for legion.
299109,hey man stfu im stuck in bronze 3 because 4 man queues camp my lane elo hell gg riot games
299146,obviously they weren't as popular so no one cares
299175,":))) yeah haha and all of the 180 up voters too, we are all sheltered"
299245,"same, seems way more rare than they did in the beta... but at least there are cash boxes now"
299293,you're an awesome guy and we all hope to find you or someone like you in our games!
299309,"cmon man, idk where you're from but around where i live, 13 year olds are way more mature than 12 year olds, and have a much more refined and sophisticated taste."
299311,"stop using your dragon ult so well, goshh."
299342,i think it'd be a pretty good idea to lose a cash cow like live.
299381,if it isn't talked about every 20 minutes then the hype isn't real!
299387,but i thought fat pigs belonged in the usa?
299410,but i still prefer rise of the tomb raider as a dx12 benchmark to see how amd performs vs nvidia.
299430,y'all did notice the face changed?
299447,the best part in my opinion is the movie does something that's pretty rare (yeah we know the story but still spoilers) [the bad guys win]
299462,almost as much effort as those bastions were having
299471,i keep having a really similar experience when i'm against solider 76
299472,"yeah, that's why they release more and more 750 rp skins"
299473,that's why he complains about 750 rp skins
299480,"i think this option promotes toxicity, and i really think it needs to be removed for the sake of the game"
299485,"yeah, fisting someone's uncle isn't offensive at all.."
299498,such a drop in their profits for them
299509,yeah g2 is surely going to get worse after being first place and getting an amazing bot lane
299512,mccree's flashbang needs a 30 second duration increase!
299553,i thought that's the way you pronounced it...
299572,"oh its that scout guy who got banned and all, lol m9 git rekt and git gud lul."
299584,from the physical damage phoenix stance gives.
299585,what would a gold nova 1 would know about sand blocking bullets anyway ^
299600,the empirical data driving the discussion is just fluff
299606,"yup, it's that simple... flick the switch shuhei!"
299622,its just a small start-up indie company
299727,finally i can avoid all the noobs on my team!
299728,going to be so fun now that there will be 2 or more tracers in every game.
299729,1/1.000.000 because that's when you'll be 7/1 with a vel'koz amirite guise?
299755,hey we all know riot - a great company that always listens to community feedback and is trying to adjust the game to their likes
299762,"yes, people are playing lol and not dota, it mean that the game is very unbalanced and trash compared to the masterpiece league of legends !"
299763,why would anyone trashtalk the wonderful company that is riot games ?
299779,how dare you disrespect the best top laner in north america
299781,yeah today was definitely his fault
299795,"its true, my gtx970 also digivolved in a gtx1080 today"
299806,-hey +look downvoted for not being a true fan
299820,"nope, there couldn't possibly be any explanation other than the one implied by these two side-by-side images!"
299826,but people that use that are plebs
299856,"blitz has a 17% play rate and a 53.5% wr, clearly deserves a nerf."
299857,must have been a lot of extra effort.
299883,but those missions that go away as you progress..
299934,"hmm, i wonder if maybe that could possibly be its intended purpose..."
299936,i have been saying this since release but muh defenders are defending rather than having equal playground
299938,probably would have just been a bunch of beeping and white noise
299943,literally no difference between silver 1 and global
299948,"well if you have 29 chromosome pairs, then you really should be generous and not greedy"
299953,hey man i'm just trying to have fun alright.
299959,it really gutted the champion though just like how the loss of leblanc's silence made her completely unviable.
299962,"yeah, all games should have a qwop styled walking!"
299988,maybe if cloud drake would give true damage to that team's ultimate abilities that would be a meaningful buff to make it more attractive.
300001,cause cool people have girlfriends and have sex with them 24/7 and only watch things related to current events
300009,yea they almost beat fnatic in the columbus group stage but let a lot of rounds go
300015,"yes, leave your adc so they die, what a good plan!"
300018,imo there should be no ranks and maybe handicap better players to make it an even playing field
300030,its definitly your teammates and dynamicq who are holding you back right?
300036,ofc nobody going to investigate this because nv would never throw right?
300090,arent they always 12 years old?
300098,reddit e-stalking young kids smh
300115,"they're not tits, they're chest tumors, i'd like to see you live in a wasteland and have a perfect body!"
300121,"unfortunately, riot doesn't have the money to do this."
300144,the new disney/pixar movie moana has the rock playing as roadhog
300189,"kda and damage dealt... in the end vision, peeling and utility are not going to win you games right?"
300207,3rd hit should be % health true damage so he'll be more in line with the new champions.
300218,because they would obviously expect olof to jump out with balls of steel after the round is over and shit all over their faces.
300225,eh the ravens one looked all right
300231,"yes, i also hate when games have more than one token strong female character especially when they are playable."
300253,"meanwhile at bungie: we, uh, nerfed fusion rifles, yes?"
300267,yeah but he's toxic so we can never mention him
300275,volvo always knows best with their numbers and statistics.
300280,kio kicked after eleague cumfirmed kappa
300288,"you are stupid man, when league released we already had million's of viewers on twitch."
300297,"sounds awesome, i always wanted to get gassed to death!"
300298,"yeah, i just bought this cheat for 100$ and i can only cheat in warmup."
300380,reloading his shurikens resets it too.
300405,at least it had that hardcore end game content that everyone wanted.
300477,"you're not allowed to like it, you have to jump on the hate train and not realize games can have spin off titles and something main stream may be in production"
300483,"hey guys, can someone upload this to a torrent?"
300492,"you always forget league of legends is a game for kids &amp; kids shouldnt read that you banged their mothers, even if you did."
300496,they are probably busy cancelling their heavily rumored spiderman game now that they found out that insomniac was already working on one
300517,"get this player on an esports team asap, the skill is real."
300529,yes this totally fixed the underlying problem with itemization
300533,"with a viewmodel like that, he's asking for it"
300600,"yeah man, season 3 rengar or remove them from the game, good fix"
300613,"i know, fuck your team for getting killed..."
300621,ok but have you tried turning if off and on
300660,"damn, this gif is funny **every damn year**"
300662,lol tbh he's right gosu's a seasoned veteran
300684,jdm is in no way winning every game for them
300695,but miss harvey is a 5x world champion
300700,"oh, so the germans get free pyrovision goggles?"
300708,not as cool as you are for telling him how cool he is!
300754,"that's why his projectiles are so easy to land, he was designed for them."
300764,taking a game off white is considered choking by people all throughout the league community.
300822,and i'm certain that team is a guaranteed win every time and there's nothing that can beat it
300847,"welp, time to buy the whole series before they raise prices"
300911,"but you cant play on the couch, amirite?"
300954,wow 2 whole maps holy shittt.
300972,i find your replays pretty hilarious too
301028,"yeah, teams gain a lot from access to the voice comms of a team who throws an 8k gold lead by being unable to win a team fight"
301033,"i love watching laneswap and turret trades, and not seeing a first blood until 20 minutes."
301061,"naww, rito bias against clg means even if they win they won't get interviewed"
301080,yea lets make champs and skins free also
301116,thats because he always follows spirit cause klaj knows spirit will get caught
301131,wewt one whole mob let me hold my breath i can't wait
301164,"i use the m4a4, those extra bullets come-in handy when you want to spam through the smoke, especially when your ~~hacks~~ game sense tells you there is a guy on the other side of the smoke"
301177,"yeah same reason why ppl got banned for using a vo for league, and not a script programm"
301349,now all we need is a bard rework
302124,vacationed too hard they got burnt out by semi at worlds
302248,yeah the blizzard official forums is such a good source of information
302711,i will definitely enjoy playing against ryze.
302829,anyone on a mac would lose lane
303248,"as a non torbjorn main, nothing personal... but fuck you and your feels."
303671,*obviously* that was just muscle memory from an old fps
303862,that's a weird way to spell reaper
303895,he's stupid for thinking g2/titan can get out of groups at major
303951,are you calling this sub racist
303969,so standard matchmaking for shara?
303991,yeah adults shouldn't play games what the fuck is wrong with them
304091,"nah, he's an expert, nip have to hire him"
304434,it's hard when you always have a res active to get 3.
304537,"no, literally no one on this sub except for you."
304567,rather riot keeping their heads high
304658,you like hard champion but you are still not out of silver due to bad team
304781,good thing ana's ult isnt broken
304856,"fnc had to wait like 4 years for their skins,wheres the justice riot?"
304926,"yes, sure the kids are clamoring for oldschool hard to play games"
304982,and...thats why your friend is better than jdm
305011,[au guldan is well on his way to being a demon and is the focus of a content patch raid]
305152,oh i'm so glad the xenobiologists of reddit are here to tell us how unrealistic this all is.
305246,so glad they're only nerfing the turret damage on console and not changing anything else that is totally not broken with his kit.
305275,don't you mean postmxn and humxn
305418,"tsm is clearly the most dominant team so far, they've won all their games in a convincing manner"
305543,is there any other type of riven?
305578,because that's never happened before
305582,hanzo's hitboxes were nerfed in this patch.
305652,thanks for being such a supportive member of the overwatch community.
305665,this is clearly fake because we all know widow maker is garbage tier since her nerf
305739,"yeah, the polite answer is... aw you special little snowflake, of course i see everything you're saying and we will rush to change this aspect of the game just to appease you"
305762,yeah fuck people who don't approve of illegal and shady sites sponsoring teams!
305798,"i didn't see him crouch, so this is legit."
305814,ye because vayne has never been played in competitive or carried games before
305821,we're used of ties so probably.
305881,the voice line is sideways whispers
305905,yeah because 2016 is already over
305910,this sounds like a brilliant idea that certainly wouldn't lead to abuse.
305913,because it is not their highest priority right now.
306003,"first they remove subs dance bar, now it turns out vanish and stealth itself is buggy and soon a class will get added that straight up sees stealthed targets, feels good to play a rogue right about now."
306031,he's actually not his wingman but his shadow
306050,"oh yeah of course it is boring to watch that's why this new game already has multiple tournaments being run, with decent sized prize pools"
306117,this would be called cheating by using modded controllers etc... nintendo should ban you!
306119,dude im not sure people in this subreddit might not see the
306148,fking valve white knights this is why i switched to overwatch where the hitreg and tickrate is flawless
306218,"good move, because its not like theres a shit ton of paid dlc"
306391,or maybe he just uses google chrome
306405,and possibly playing games iswell
306411,yes but telling a guy you bought an operation (cosmetic) what you think apparently is bad
306412,because they can play with friends
306433,why would i only want half of a wing?
306518,just wait untill they smash tsm
306522,so then the 10th place team can qualify for the gauntlet and eventually make it to worlds
306558,"of course not, its a scoll not a long ass book"
306618,yea cant wait to see team ember reach the top
306687,"**yeah man, because fuck what other people think and like, even if it is harmless**"
306717,nah forgiven is always the toxic egoistic adc who cant finish a split with a team
306798,"don't worry guys, i'm sure the streamers will be testing this for us plebs without beta."
306859,but it can't be a joke if it isn't real!
306865,"i have both a troll monk and a pandaren rogue, i feel like a special snowflake"
306892,if only bjerg was not in this game imt would have won!
306918,that's a wonderful way to check for a competent healer.
306990,"yeah, i don't know why tsm fans are downvoting"
307043,nah og doesn't need coaches they are all veterans
307064,i really love getting videos of people blaring music into their mic for a 5 second clip of them getting a double kill.
307079,"yeah how dare he have a challenger team with up and coming talent that isn't usually found in the lcs, while competing with spring splits c9 lcs squad."
307147,"mount up, go to the nearest enemy player, and just start pressing hotkeys."
307163,"but a high skill ceiling means that character should be allowed to do anything, as long as it looks mlg pro, right?"
307222,"but, i put this awesome filter on it!"
307240,because everyone is a pro-gamer or streamer.
307247,"i wish people would stop making these, blizzard is gonna run out of new skins because people already made them."
307281,"hm, raging about how other people spend their own time/money seems reasonable..."
307306,"ya, brb, getting an emmy nomination myself"
307316,"i really like this art style, but tbh the butt ruins it for me"
307321,can't even load a simple magazine; no wonder your wife left you.
307339,"swag getting unbanned, you heard it here first"
307371,"why not everyone just play games for your own enjoyment, nah that's crazy talk never mind"
307410,whaaatt... it's not like nintendo to try and sue someone for even slightly referencing one of their properties...
307415,i would have great game sense too with an aimlock key
307424,the answer is obvious here: you missed the genji because that is jeff kaplan and he has a special lead developer aura that protects him from mccree damage.
307441,but her laning phase is so interactive
307502,but that's like a different planet.
307510,how can i see the cracks when the shield is behind me?
307518,instal shaders and post again for sweet karma.
307572,"the obvious solution is to get newer, better, friends."
307588,"thinking fat people are gross means the same thing as hating women, doncha know?"
307665,starting to believe this game is not real... just one or two planets that they show off at different events and it's all just a dream...
307722,apart from thorin who saw this coming in early 2015
307738,but... but... you need to like what i say you need to like!
307771,it's in the patch notes ^^^somewhere lazy people.
307796,then they will have to introduce standard
307806,huhi is a 5x better syndra player.
307825,but i thought playing vs higher skilled players made you better ?
307849,because pros are never wrong and don't have knee-jerk reactions or bandwagon as bad as the rest of this retarded community
307910,who would have thought that pushing the os as an update automatically and installing it without consent would have worked as much?
307994,more like majority owner of esl or wesa
308151,"nah, they haven't increased the prince in 4 years, why would it possibly be linked to rising costs of buisness."
308188,the nixxiom how to guide is better
308221,the following is where mercy is best mercy v symm turret mercy v torb turret (not mc turret) mercy v junkrat trap
308232,"man, i guess the rumors of him being replaced are stopped because he had 1 good game"
308305,yeah cause changing the flair is so difficult
308329,"someone should have done some more research, because spoilers, [this is not where he actually dies...]"
308430,but dude being passive aggressive is so much more fun
308496,well we do know that she who has the information has the power...
308555,oh wow who knew u could jump with a scout and have it be accurate
308609,but muh world champion and best adc fantasy
308637,will prob never happen.. but nice try :/ cs go was never great anyway
308687,"yeah he became a billionaire by being an un-charismatic, un-creative, idiot"
308695,"it's been while since i played left 4 dead, but that seems about right."
308766,"yeah, don't play a dps class because everyone finds it boring."
308774,don't you just love our 'straya tax!
308808,we don't joke about war in the balkans
308851,because clearly the new cod is just a strait up rip off of halo.
308885,wait this first time i have seen this info since last night.
308899,skt sponsoring nba team confirmed
308913,nah i trust op over valve's economists
308960,"yea, tank/juggernauts champs are pretty bad right now .. :/"
308979,it's not like we already knew malz was broken like 2 weeks ago or anything
309077,yea and let us kill hanzos dragons with 2 shots please
309146,right cuz harm requires intent.
309169,ahhh i love 3 seconds roots with a 0.75 ap ratio
309183,only flashes that work in every possible situation without fail are useful and i will hate on every other contribution.
309191,yeah it's totally not like widow had vision up
309201,because being hit in the shoulder is worse than the heart.
309213,"yep, we found the console gamer"
309224,but you would get support any way so its not different for him
309229,i see that you have a degree in game design.
309233,"yes, clearly the vocal minority will be upvoted to the top for no reason at all."
309337,electro therapy will do wonders
309428,maybe that's why scripters use spacebar
309437,like anybody actually writes to you
309449,"more than once, there are some big things going down, for instance, [lol not spoiling]"
309470,i thought the human eye couldn't see past 30 fps?
309483,"after failing to stop scream's ninja defuse, flusha knew it was time to toggle"
309502,"from what i've seen, [that's actually kind of what happens during the demon hunter order hall campaign.]"
309523,who cares about this no show bronze adc we have peco
309570,yeah i've never played a game with realistic fall mechanics
309573,"i always wanted xx x xx, hopefully that'll be available."
309604,"i don't see the problem, just spamming a door."
309619,because once you get to silver you can actually get gold from cs
309624,thank you for spoiling the story.
309637,no they will but it has happened for far less too
309641,"that is like, 36 games when the summer sale hits!"
309681,tell me the point of stone brick if you can't get stone back
309687,i plan run to the junglers start get auto'd by coming out of fog of war then flash into the mid turret.
309713,"well you know, germans are historically opposed to violence and all that"
309715,obviously those who are transgender are on par if not worse than a racist group known for lynching people
309727,no he used the dragons through him... as in they went through him!
309755,just put em to work and feed em that'll make em happy
309763,incoming overwatch -prehistoric expac coming fall 2017 introduces a level cap and new set of heroes
309776,"nah man, we just knew there was a reason not to"
309809,"he has a low pick rate though, so he should get a free pass on winrate"
309813,"wow its like taking an instrumental and playing it at a faster tempo, why hasn't anyone thought of this before for all music"
309898,clearly in beta with all the skills on those action bars!
309900,"ladies and gentlemen, welcome to"
309917,maybe microsoft bricked the console on purpose
309973,insider information here folks!
309975,you get one or the other with those two
310073,everybody is getting challenger there... i might aswell go to korea aswell
310095,yeah pyth hasn't achieved anything better than na since
310106,so lets all play the original game and ignore all others in the same genre because thats what superior people do
310111,"because that's totally what happens in hearthstone, a completely f2p game that does the same thing."
310112,maybe eleague should signup phantomlord for the intervals?
310134,tfw r/overwatch becomes a porn sub
310140,"psh, this will be useless when i can't use it at the next major"
310154,have you built a processor yourself?
310160,"books: [in the books, she is a huge badass leader of a giant pack of wolves in the riverlands.]"
310184,well fuck i went to every team's gaming house and swag was at all of them but c9s
310190,"pretty salty announcement that's what it stands for, so i don't get how rants fall outside that category."
310210,this is problematic because you're saying that the woman should be shot first which enforces the patriariarchy.
310249,"your ruse is up, you only made this video to beg s1mple to come back didn't you?"
310256,yes the fury x is the clear winner here!
310298,"sure, because they will totally listen to me"
310323,but.. but.. dynamic queue is suposed to reduce toxicity!
310329,"wow maybe, i think they will still add content to it in 2100"
310330,riot can't ban her... she has boobs!
310341,"yes, riot has a secret agenda where they want to destroy their game with dynamic queue, but revive it at the same time with discounts cuz xd!"
310365,even lyte thought these decisions were too toxic and ducked out quick
310373,but phantomlex said he was cheating hes cheating hes cheating hes cheating phantom lex is a top tier player he could easily be in fply and rank
310406,"wow, you are so cool, be my friend please."
310420,"maybe not, we still got complexity in the groups!"
310427,but korea has much more practice in bo1 because they play 2-3x as many bo1s during their season
310439,yes because losing 1 of 18 best of series is a good indicator of the results of an entire season.
310450,you're telling me all offensive heroes doesn't work?
310468,yeah cus that's totally the same

310508,"if you can't beat her, beat her."
310512,"while everyone was searching for the gold sound, i was looking at one thing: [bewbs]"
310519,because esea ac is the best and if it doesn't detect him then obviously he is leigt
310520,just let your account decay for a few months.
310529,"rip worst players, so much potential on that team"
310543,"nah reddit is biased,league is at its peak atm-dq rly is amazing- and the top% are just egoistic kids who dont know anything!"
310569,bastion got nerfed so hard he is literally unplayable
310570,can we just upvote because this is clearly an amazing giveaway?
310578,"i prefer imovie over sony vegas, but that's just my two cents."
310604,really feel like i know more about the character now
310626,"well he can't pass without making sure everyone else knows he's going to pass, otherwise what's the point?"
310636,yes but are they better than tsm?
310664,yeah but csgo is dying now check reddit
310727,"probably fired the guy responsible and splitting up their salary to give us all $10, haha.."
310740,oh yeah that corn is real hard to come by these days...
310783,shit i didn't think i needed the
310806,shroud would still have 10 kills
310834,so you're saying we need a scorpio s in order to do both?
310869,but im practicing for survival...
310885,"oh well i am not good at this as you might guess :d , get a dlore or a knight and give it to me :d"
310909,"wow, i didn't know you can actually use your skills to kill someone, thanks for the combo write-up and in-depth analysis."
310919,he cant be the king of reddit since he is not from na
310922,why doesn't rito listen to the community though?
310941,we got 5 more minutes don't lose hope
310982,"not black though, 3/10 would not classify as a win for the fight for social justice."
310994,"okay, but then stop playing thresh, blitzcrank, morgana, etc as well because they have skillshots."
311029,"whelp, solo players get a pat on the back, i think the issue is all solved here boys, nothing more to see"
311056,so they won't upscale the dull games as well?
311069,"nice subtle trolling mate, can you be more obvious please?"
311111,he cannot handle strong russian woman
311116,"what texture pack is that, it's so minimalistic!"
311136,your ability to evaluate your own actions is pretty good
311148,immortals be like nah i dont like majors
311176,"oh hey, brazil's football team didn't lost to germany, they lost for themselves :^) of course, let's give credit for the german players for scoring the goals."
311212,you mean the beta is supposed your personal playground and that it shouldn't be used to test for potentially game breaking issues?
311291,lol skyrim remastered will top this
311362,"typical genji player, doesn't contest the point."
311367,it's all a ploy to slowly turn everyone away from consoles and towards the true master race
311378,"i didn't know you could install steam on a mac, it's not like it can play games"
311381,that's because short guys can't protect women or make them feel safe!
311382,but why can't it destroy the gate and then the lock?
311395,"didnt matter that he dc'd tho since you still had your 4 friends, having 6 people on the rift would have been awkward anyway"
311412,"false, i was playing torb and got dropped."
311415,"it's in the known issues list, great testing pal"
311455,man nip falling from 1st to 5th is harsh
311556,"since clear skies was a prequel, soc should obviously be counted as a sequel to that game."
311582,"yes, math puzzles instead of csgo."
311729,"go away with that logic, k0nfig is a hacker"
311778,"how is man city considered an english team, they only have 2 english starters"
311783,that's cool it's not like i wanted to play
311788,"gee, they were so disrespectful towards olof right now..."
311850,but tsm will surely close the gap
311867,yeah because lanebullys like renekton or riven were so viable in the laneswap era
311908,"wow, i can't believe halo ripped off cod all those years before"
313483,they can't shoot a head how would they shoot a toe?
313575,ethan must have lost a lot of skins for him to hunt this information down
313840,yeah and when your cooldown for bork or randuins is coming up they should flash some lights to remind you
314058,yes how dare someone attempts to defend sticker star to downvote hell with you
314111,well youtube works fine for the 100k people watching it so i have my doubts.
314221,gotta advertise the new all chat man.
314276,"only if it has exo suits and supply drops, otherwise i won't be able to play it."
314296,i can't trust a news site that doesn't use words like blast eviscerated or slammed in their headlines.
314399,"thanks, i was wondering what i wasn't watching today."
314506,"yeah single player is overrated, i just want to be killed over and over again until i quit."
314518,back before casuals ruined the game in beta
314570,[they're recruiting him to be one of the four horseman]
314786,why doesnt flusha have any skins because its only a matter of time before he gets vac'd
314798,liquid is clearly cheating of course
314841,that's a very interesting mod and resource pack you have there.
314965,the viewer counts were low this game becase c9 fans weren't watching this major
315054,"yeah, dude; you're supposed to let them try and cap the point."
315074,but does ice cream have an app on your ice cream sandwich?
315497,"yup, cause that's what gave it away"
315556,all the time...sure we all believe this.
315625,"applying a purple orb from a long range to make your enemies take more damage without affecting them in any other way so you can throw your pure spiritual energy at them is also weird, blizzard should make kits more realistic"
315754,yeah just like he regrets publishing the ibuypower thing.
315813,"hey let's be easy on them, they couldn't set up the stage facing another direction because after all humanity has not figured out the pattern yet of where the sun comes up/down or where it's located at a certain time of the day."
315861,"i was born in 2000, id be pro too if my team wasn't holding me back"
315874,"give em a chance man, riot is just a small company."
315948,it would lower his skillcap and make him a noob champ
315964,"somday we will have an emerald nightmare expac, then we will have an expac where we go back in time to where it was the emerald dream."
315965,no demon hunter's spec is havoc
316058,"don't worry, once the tribunal goes live you'll get to work on helping clean up summoner's rift!"
316092,e-leagueal reference game on point
316151,its too strong so riot doesn't want you to know
316213,nobody cares about playing the game any more just e-celebs and drama
316270,yeah those challenger teams can't do anything about him.
316477,i think the real problem here is that the m4 isn't a 1 hit headshot
316529,dude get the fuck out with your logic bullshit
316573,yea bring back the old queue where i had to fight for my role and people trolled because they didnt want to follow pick order!
316574,people would just transfer to eu and get free level 7 on every champ and transfer back to na.
316575,"yea man, riot only has 3 workers and they all work on skins!"
316629,bengi only has 2 legs so he couldn't do the spider form
316733,"naw man, they just wanted to sit at the big pc gamer table."
316754,hmm never seen anything like that before...
316804,1/10... no social club ban message.
316873,lets her snipe from higher places y'know

316945,of course not when we are losing it's obviously not my fault.
316946,"wow, i've never seen a comment like this!"
316990,but the word league is in it
316997,i for one blame hltv since they clearly provided the stats
317086,they literally employed pr people to stay silent
317093,you shouldn't have to lose the game just to have a ward skin
317103,"nah man, matchmaking is balanced, thank you valve for prime mm."
317104,dont think i have seen urgot in a year and many people do it
317149,yea cause he is getting kicked obv
317237,"okay, let's see here... wings, new boats, beetroots, expanded end... yeah we don't need that, we have polar bears now!"
317268,"damnit, there i was thinking i was a badass facing the tank..."
317280,finally valve cought him cheating and thats how they make him retire
317391,"1,070 points (71% upvoted) *sooo* unpopular."
317454,broken shore spoilers broken shore spoilers broken shore spoilers [tell that to tirion fordring.]
317473,they did such a good job with e-league
317486,that didn't stop splyce aka best team in world why should it stop c9
317493,"i believe illidan actually makes a comment about this in the demon hunter starting zone when [you have to sacrifice someone to open a portal for your allies and you choose to sacrifice yourself, illidan comments that your soul is able to return to your body and revive yourself just like he can.]"
317505,wow this tournament just keeps on getting stacked and stacked.
317555,"dope, now i can abuse all the genji mains"
317574,to inflate the install size so people think its better.

317708,her crosshair placement is amazing...
317863,even is he is cheating reporting him won't do jackshit lmao
317876,"they should go even further and just let anybody make games with their characters too, and also let them sell them and make money off of them as well"
317888,"no matter what people say to you dardoch, tyler1 fans accept your new found toxicity and welcome you."
317968,yea its fun to watch the other facition fight demons while you sit on your flying mount
317974,illaoi such a fun champion to play against
318045,yea tbh when michael phelps started doing drugs i thought he was really cool and drugs were ok.
318066,"and you, of course, would altruistically refuse the billions of dollars and keep churning out code"
318067,how dare you want to spend your money on something you want and not what i tell you to spend it on
318124,uhh i one shot the lich king the other day i think i can handle some demons
318186,because every church is like this.
318280,"ehm, what is that yellow color?"
318285,"yeah, because these features are written and tested in two weeks"
318312,olof must have seen flusha's custom cheat and decided not to play with them.
318345,every time someone died: he's lagging so fucking funny.
318372,"yeah, sweep it under rug already!"
318406,damn i was expecting locodoco to win this one
318407,can't wait to buy it next year!
318455,sounds like we need more teams in regional leagues.
318470,well can you at least unban steel and dazed because na has no good igl's
318521,"get to a low enough elo, usually they counter themselves."
318555,neon pink and colorful af skins.
318600,"it's ok, china is worse than na now, at least clg got 2nd place in msi"
318601,"yeah, i'm sure he's the one picking these things with no say from his team or coach."
318602,never thought it like that thanks!
318626,"become otp, play 1 champ, problem solved"
318654,"they kinda are batting for their own team, getting an xbox could make them a filithy gajjin."
318685,"i agree, when i'm learning something i like to just fucking wing it and see what happens with absolutely no research whatsoever."
318725,there was this p.t thing that looked kinda awesome..haven't heard much since it got released.
318747,"actually they do, because they have no range."
318748,"good move, riot, release champion update to cover up the shitstorm caused by monte ;)"
318781,but they wont buy the previous games then!
318789,"you just dont get it, it cant be overhyped when its a game **i** like!"
318820,"ah, but this time it's a count up."
318828,defense heroes can't even defend themselves.
318846,"i googled for hours didnt find that xyz cheat, maybe valve deleted them"
318854,it's no fun til someone dies reaper/vicarious devour to survive reaper/vicarious much better you than i reaper/vicarious step into the shadow reaper/forty-six &amp; 2 who would have thought tool would align well with the edgelord
318879,torb should also be able to heal bastions
318883,but you can only get it from halloween lootboxes!
318884,riot is already doing that themselves
318895,hey man i never saw na'vi go 87-0
318920,"and this, my friends, is why the alliance are all racists."
318921,"oh yes, genji's e which can block miss freeze's gun."
318945,"it's useful of you're running smite, you can upgrade the bami into cinderhulk with the ward jungle item"
318970,rioters on alt accounts trying to get people's attention from tryndamere's drama
318973,the food completely tilted them dude
318991,everyone knows real games look like pixelated piles of shit that make your eyes bleed.
319025,stop i am this close to having one highlight for each champion that way whenever i get play of the game i have a highlight i don't need to go through this again win intro music
319055,i think kicking peacemaker so he could make it to the grand finals of the next major was the right choice
319078,healing isn't a real gold medal
319087,but symmetra gives out shields so of course she's a support.
319092,titans with recharging shields will be a titan that's day 1 dlc...
319113,"yes praying to the light saved tirion, so it will save us too."
319120,it's not tank if you build a tri force!

319149,not when ur crosshair placement is that poor kappa
319160,"agreed, nv's chances of a miracle run just got increased by 100% from 1% to 2%"
319199,are you saying there's another choice besides alliance?
319209,"yeah, fuck this guy for having a different view and opinion than us"
319259,sadly for us the technology just isn't there yet.
319377,how dare you call a pakistani an indian!
319430,doomhammer should be horde only clearly.
319466,hey does that pose look a bit overly-sexual to anyone else?
319496,"clearly you are wrong and this reaction is warranted, as the gaming community is known for its patient, measured reactions."
319498,they will other teams just need to kill skt's best player 3 times pre 10mins without giving up a kill shouldn't be too hard
319518,"all rng players have flash on d, and they have won all games until now."
319551,we wouldnt have this problem if the m4 could have 1-hit headshots
319582,obviously not because his team lost 4 games in a row
319622,yeah i can't wait until they announce their premium plan for this game
319632,"no idea, but i do know that paper jam was made by dimps."
319636,"they don't have hats, so they've got a long way to go."
319711,but it wasnt fun because he typed owned into the chat afterwards it was harsh bm
319716,i think that crosshair negates any advice you have
319755,thats why they totally didn't make a system to catch people stealing lanes
319783,but it's public behind the scenes knowledge that monte comes from a rich family!
319785,and we all know learning from your mistakes is not as thing.
319839,g2-8 obviously trying to get away from their memes or are scared of lol memes leaking to csgo.
319860,"hey man, if i try hard enough i can hanzo/genji my way into any enemy team comp"
319900,but my k/d will be messed up if i die!
319901,why not just dodge 2 normals and save yourself from the loss of lp?
319907,all about the points ... points are everything
319908,oh well if you say so i'll just go ahead and drop $90 on it
319910,"yeah, i always tell that to the mg players aswell when i smurf."
319920,"nah he's just trolling extra hard, this was actually bm in korean culture"
319921,+roorooo...cuz tarik and roorooo get along so well in rank
319959,who doesn't want to do that when fighting mei?
319970,"but thats gonna cost us a raid tier and create 100 bugs and break other features, and lets not overwhelm new players with too many options."
319989,"yea, it was so obvious no one thought it would be a good lane"
320022,to counter heimer who heals turrets!
320048,but winrates aren't a masure for anything such knowledgable very good thinking reddit and riot +1 from me
320066,i think soda might go single then
320076,i found this about a block away is it yours?
320090,"yes, but no one who matters will buy it on console anyway..."
320099,"yes because anyone who disagrees with your negative views towards an individual, group of individuals, or organization is a fanboy."
320122,the physics seem pretty logical to me.
320136,wow and here i thought everybody was going to talking about how reasonable that was
320203,he kicked before he punched 2/10
320261,"you are right i didn't notice that, must not be global for not noticing the slowdown or being an expert in knife animations..."
320285,[to bad there will be dalaran hs with 20min cd - none will ask it - at least there is one in beta]
320326,"do you have to compensate for spray pattern, as well as manage economy in those games too?"
320334,yeah hes totally not pick/banned in every game because hes brainlessly op
320365,oh shit time to get my comics and shit bucket...
320387,"no, just pure greater skill needed to use a controller"
320409,"huehuehue oink, wait till everyone buys overwatch and league dies off oink"
320412,i like how the xbox 360 are worth more than the xbox one games...
320422,nonono it's (gold)(team1)(team2)(gold) in league and (team1)(score)(team2)(score) in the nba completely different!
320426,"small businesses are shit, not because they're new/in a near monopolized industry, but because they are shit."
320439,so stop being bad and kill them as soon as they're out of their spawn
320474,"everytime i face a soldier 76 they are hacking, he's not even aiming at me and i die."
320475,"yeah, how dare a growing company make mistakes and not let them hold back development!"
320485,"certainly not, they all buy their video cards and never boast about their fps and maxed settings."
320497,yeah when you get to a higher level you'll see teams with 2 bastions 2 meis and 2 pharahs cause they are the best
320509,my biggest complain is the lack of lootbox luck for me
320528,"wait a minute... fishtails, just who is this hussy and why haven't you been calling me?"
320555,"die, die, die... yeah, he sure is badass isn't he."
320584,serious issue game is unplayable
320619,downvote for low graphics setting
320634,because no other hero in the game has an ult that can kill the whole team.
320691,yea making marksmen completely broken on the update was such a success!
320695,"look at his build he was clearly going for the ad jhin build, which is more worth"
320699,fuck dude i thought abc would know about a screen capture software
320708,are we talking about the same game?
320730,nah bro even though we got a subreddit for this stuff already people should be able to just post shit here too bro man bro
320769,i for one missed only having 7 boots
320788,gonna revisit this post in 4 years and complain that it's not even 3d :)
320814,"like, can you not make fun of my typing disorder"
320824,"oh yeah, i'm having so much fun with my legendary bastion skin"
320836,"yeah, i'm sure they're just totally wrong and are storing petabytes of information (last time i checked they grab 15 seconds of mic data for every status update on their app) just for yolos sake."
320896,i'm more impressed you're playing a gba game on a game boy color
320912,"the trick is to not shoot where they will be, but to shoot from where you might be."
320922,the jungler should have never put him in a position to fail flash
320932,they need to remove the gorilla and while we're at it make the characters gender neutral
320933,but isn't everyone born in the us muthafucking a?
320938,that's all lies and fake stats made by riot!
320940,"i know, it's such a weird coincidence!"
320946,"the uk isn't on there either, but half of us can't speak english anyway."
320955,"no he doesnt, hes a illiterate asian who cant speak english properly obviously..."
320992,"i feel like i'm pretty good at pharah, but my death count also just happens to be my ult count."
321051,"yeah, and d.va needs a range nerf for her ult."
321056,i aspire to be like summit1g in every way so i burn in my own molotovs and say ulti
321057,"yeah, but 200+ hours to get to character creation isn't exactly fun"
321085,i want to see monte gush over tsm for hours!
321090,i don't think people would be that offended if pharah would yell allah akbar while she's using her ult.
321131,glad they're focusing on the important bc...
321163,devils are merciful and heal people
321234,in before they claim the groups were rigged and they were matched against the strongest opponents.
321316,you mean s doesn't stand for scorpio?
321331,to be fair if you were a team player you would get off your ass and learn to heal on genji.
321332,let's also establish a league for non white league players so all of the whites can dominate their own league.
321338,well he's black so he can't be a racist.
321359,"screw him downvoted you're missing part of the rule, there."

321691,no i think i'll leave it up for 200 more years and a half
321692,they really have their a team working on these brawl ideas
321733,because riot never goes back on there decisions to sell skins that were made to be one time only offers
321738,nice job covering the silent aim!
321746,do it like switzerland and buy your own server
321783,can't wait for the c9 stickers.

321965,"he was pretty damn strong on release and because pros said he wasn't good (because they somehow didn't see his extremely obvious niche ffs) they unnecessarily buffed him and then he was busted af, meanwhile i was in gold so my opinion didn't matter and i was a shitter"
321985,because every bug ever was that easy to fix
322017,"hey guys if you aren't getting your primary role, put what you really want to play as your secondary role"
322056,"fine, if you don't know how much for your womans, how much for boy?"

322217,"assassin downvote brigade incoming as a support main i loved season 3, it was really fun to see assassins oneshotting everyone, yay"
322289,and following it a permanent ban cause you are extremely toxic for leaving the game
322328,are perhaps this sub can only understand
322330,"thats why i don't go for dragons early game, so i can get elder ezpz in the late game."
323548,as if they aren't already wake up sheeple

324146,yeah i see graves with ga spirit visage warmogs or zzrot every other day
324266,yeah its warzone firefight... and that makes it totally different.
324385,because everybody (and i mean _every single player of this game_) has a master tier friend with infinite smurfs who can boost them to diamond in their copious spare time.
324394,i find that sarcasm comes through great in text
324395,pffft i've never seen anybody appearing offline
324484,more news breaking than lotto fraud
324515,"but they can sell more copies that way, that's why it's better to have a console and support this kind of behavior!"
324741,is there a version that's all blue?
324754,"it's not like he just got 4 kills or anything, right?"
324755,my formatting skills are nearly as non existent as your flair in this major.
324907,"yeh ... lets stop this random posting on reddit, it just wastes everybodys time."

325205,i thought you were admitting your were wrong
325420,"yeah, they completely rewrote the code that handles the rng of how loot is selected just so you get some stuff."
325451,maybe the spirit was inhabiting a soul so that it could travel the rift?
325523,yea remember when witcher 3 was delayed and how shitty that turned out?

326563,at least this time he followed through and didn't choke.
326609,yes i put it in every resume i send out
326727,"i can see you have obviously adapted your playstyle to the damage shifts at earlier levels, and have adjusted your itemization and levels of aggression."
326762,transmog hunters would love that
326816,"but getting 10k inputs a second from the client isent obvious at all, any korean can do that."

327300,blizzard is know for supporting its fan made content when it wants to make whole new games.
327380,why do you think clg was their rival for so long
327509,new players were intimidated by the amount of information just like with char stat screen and interface options.
327573,"yea man, they dont care about feeding which is why trm didnt get banned for feeding on stream."
327574,well since you never see her then i guess that means shes weak!
327615,"maybe -starix +s1mple, because s1mple has a great personality that really helps the team morale as a coach"
327628,"i'd like to personally thank you for sharing this deep meaning, as we are all now educated on clgs name!"

328803,the technology is just not there yet
328814,how much did it cost to coax snyper out of retirement?
328943,yeah i would have totally preferred to watch a slow game with 8 kills where 1 team just slowly loses the game without any fights happening.
328961,"my friend who doesn't play lol linked this to me with the description 'wtf has riot done, this is the cringiest shit ever' so i guess it's a good advert"
329024,"it's to offset the price of the ps4 neo, this way they don't have to charge so much and be more competitive with the upcoming scorpio."
329031,"they should just put pobelter top, since he gets top 50% of the time in dynamic q anyway."
329046,"with 17 quintillion planets out there, i'm sure all this missing content just hasn't been found yet."
329073,no more 4th ban gift from papa riot
329075,regi is a good guy but he underpays his players and staff

329099,but i love riot games and league of legends!
329104,"you suck mate, you forgot to die after the ress"
329137,but riot's dick is so nice and suckable tho
329146,"ya, i think i may be able to have hours of fun with that over the course of 2000 years or so."
329160,"nope, you'll have to go buy that 360 again"

329197,"i personally would like autoaim on head of that guy who is attacking me, but only if he is in my effective range and make it so my opponents can't have that so the game is not too hard for me."
329224,yeah clg wouldve totally never been swept if they had a sol!
329235,but stixxay was beating doublelift in lane!

329437,pssh come on you can clearly see his body.
329439,"washed up adc in na, nothing special at all"
329468,how dare ps+ give us discounts on great games!
329484,i mean isn't new zealand just australia-lite?
329501,maybe she just died with her finger on the trigger
329518,daily beatings are good for the character.
329528,"you're what's wrong with the community, can't you cater to the hardcore a little more"
329534,just use the wod garrison transmog set its so amazing
329560,players hiding in bushes is like half the depth in league
329580,if only there were mods for minecraft?
329606,you'd have to change your flair to lg tho:/
329634,he is not toxic i doubt he will get banned
329664,"admit it, you were afraid of that they'd change her dance into something more fitting of her character :d"
329669,"yeh, you're right how we feel about dq as a community is pointless"
329697,never would have guessed this would happen.
329702,but we can't see anything past 30fps
329718,prices were in euro shit *literally un ~~playable~~ answerable
329796,whats this honor you are talking about
329820,"but rebuilding the park is just catering to new players, only the best players should get to experience it."
329833,yes youre right you should be the coach of the team because you obviously know whats the best for the team
329859,sounds like they are trying to tone down junglers with fast early clears and hurt all others in the process ... never seen that mistake before
329950,it'll be fun shooting nazis again.
329958,"no dude, i am so much more inconvenienced by these posts than the people with the disabilities"
329962,it really needed that dub step twist.
330011,use bonemeal and overgrow the entire thing.
330039,wow that sounds like so much fun to play against
330047,"hold up, there's like 7 more months for kennys to get in shape"
330050,but chris badawi is just misunderstood and a good guy right?
330051,zero indication to that but ok... but an nvidia fanboy would say that
330100,i guess a lot of people are going to miss him
330107,thats what i would do as a top tier raider/pvper at the start of legion
330240,announcer being playable while also announcing potg's seems unfair.
330283,don't you just love it when that tracer/reaper/genji is way out behind enemy lines and starts spamming i need healing?
330308,"maybe not, but that means you have an opinion that disagrees with someone else's so you are wrong"
330332,and here is the first step towards a better world for cs:go!
330468,"na man, cod sucks don't you know"
330509,it's because human eye can't see past 60 fps
330521,"yeah he just plays video games all day dude, you nailed it."
330539,i sure am terrified of this champion that got hotfix nerfed to remove half his damage and then shat on even harder in 6.10 for being made viable.
330568,yes gotta love great work he did with chelsea this season.
330572,"dumbest idea i ever heard, better go ask strangers on the internet who can do my research for me"
330589,"guilte you're slacking, i clearly saw some bodyshots (shoulder) in there."
330620,its becasue of the game running at 30 fps
330625,just buy some merc treads bronze shitter
330631,more time for people to save up and buy it
330679,yeah quality champs are those who get nerfed over and over again and are still strong afterwards.
330685,"nah, you can't get on vacation that young."
330723,"that must mean that they love fizz and hate yi, and totally not that they are separate issues that are not equally as hard to fix!"
330767,"we already have that, it's called twitter."
330769,yeah man quick decision making and reaction time have nothing to do with genetics!
330779,working a full day wow pogchamp
330824,just tell the raidlead you're taking shuriken toss for the best range damage.
330839,whats up pimps and players let me play vs these bronze players and show you my skills
330857,"just think of toxicity, though.."
330895,they still can't choose the name .. so they will disable her untill they choose a good name for her things
330930,lol no but really mac is great gaming computers
330950,"let's be real here, nobody without a level 5 mastery should be getting an s rank any way"
330969,"it's fucking renegades, this c9 circlejerk is killing me"
330987,sure... i'm still leaning toward freakzoid
330999,"for sure, dardoch really showed up in the playoff!"
331018,overwatch really is a tf2 clone!
331026,because you didn't buy their monitor.
331027,"holy fuck that made me so wet, can't wait for eu lcs to start now!"
331094,"yeah, removing 44 armor from a champion for no real good reason other than an item overcompensating ad junglers seemed like a really intelligent move at the time"
331109,thats cause leffen wasnt around to stop him ;)
331116,because they are wayyy tooo good and 1000^10x better than every pro that if they give advice to anyone it would be a unfair advantage
331161,"well, at least then i can hear who is a girl and harrass her afterwards."
331167,i have challenger mechanics... i'm not climbing just because those evil 4 men premades are holding me back when i get in team with them and they are carrying hard because they have voice chat when i'm against them
331182,how can you miss something you never had?
331187,or like +45 ms that increases to +100 when out of combat.
331201,yeah i'm sure you lost a ton of sleep over it.
331207,yes that's why lichbane also never was an item for her
331209,clearly it's because there were 2 world's fighting
331216,"yeah better throw that lantern everytime you need to collect souls far away, instead of saving mates"
331233,experience the comedic brilliance of dorkly
331250,because unreal tournament definitely was never one of the first esports
331252,"but everyone in high elo just loves autofill, im sure silver players who are scared to death of trying to carry a game on support would just love that."
331281,pe gets two *teams* we get two *devs* woo-hoo
331415,"but they're all just faceroll, it has nothing to do with my potato positioning or them getting fed because everyone is bad"
331424,sir how can you even bother criticizing gameplay when you clearly aren't able to play stuff like this even in the slightest?
331425,so thats how gameplay looks like on consoles :)
331439,"like, maybe if you want a tank so bad, you should switch off support to play tank to actually help the team!"
331459,haha yeah hiko definitely isn't one of the top na players with some of the most experience out there
331507,haha he said animu grill so funny
331510,"aim no brain can carry you to pro-level, just look at tarik"
331557,"gotta love reddit, always making me feel better about myself"
331564,i'm sure a lot of people alive today can relate to this feeling
331643,this isn't okay but when tyler1 did it was hilarious xddd
331662,she isn't shooting them so she's useless
331671,"no, no one will take the air dragon because it desyncs skins recall animations."
331691,"it's okay, cuz amd will release freerays soon!"
331711,obviously you spelled sceyence wrong.
331713,"i mean, it's not like tsm won a bunch of shit while under loco's coaching or anything"
331736,probably because nintendo has nothing to show.
331754,greetings fellow console player
331762,this sucks it isnt the green that genjis sword has
331781,well she has short pink hair and she's muscular so obviously she's gay
331783,well i dont want to hear screaming for the entire match
331784,get ready for animal crossing town designer then.
331792,widowmaker is op though she's like hanzo and s76 in one character!
331798,he's just an experienced hacker who uses the same password for all his accounts
331802,of course they are the sexy gay people
331846,yeah maybe league should do the dota structure of not having an update for 8 months and making users do all the skin-making etc.
331855,"exactly, years ago i bought a game called quake, i expected a seismology simulator, but it was nothing like that, i was furious how they tricked me!"
331879,"accusations without providing examples, definitely credible"
331889,maybe you should stop being terrible!
331890,"you can now only dynamic queue, no solo allowed!"
331898,"don'tchya know everyone using the same items, masteries and runes increases the skill ceiling!"
331961,you'd love to see $800 vacuum cleaners?
332000,"yes, questions like how much is a plane ticket to alaska or is it legal to leave my kid alone for ever if i leave her $20 for pizza are appropriate."
332056,oh yeah he shows bjergson who's boss...
332095,how dare they put the main test realm in their own house
332113,"980s are **so** expensive, i know."
332180,"i've considered uninstalling, tbh."
332195,quiet cant wear clothes downvote
332211,maybe that bad hanzo/widow/genji should practice vs bots.
332219,f*cking 128 tick servers... where are the 256 tick servers?
332283,haahahahaha get rekt lol sick roast
332320,"they asked for unpopular opinions, not for you lie to us."
332377,the game should clearly be perfectly matching people up within 3 hours of competitive release
332424,who would have that this would be so popular?
332430,"no, you clearly didn't read the post and are also retarded."
332498,day in the life of bullyzoid: the s1mple story
332545,but she didnt say no either...
332577,"hey, they should already be plat but their teams keep feeding and it's always everyone else's fault."
332581,sounds fair to players that don't know how to set up commands for b hopping
332602,this is what happens when you retcon all of your existing lore
332608,how do you explain sonic x then?
332627,"well, you spent another 30 seconds commenting bout that .. gj!"
332645,be careful people will say you're garbage elo stuck in elo hell blaming dq i mean i dont see other reason you could possibly hate dq?
332960,"ya no way they will use blizzcon to do main client releases, its just another day."
333005,yeah cause everybody just loves watching charmander flying around breathing fire everywhere
333012,"yeah, it's a great place to earn money"
333352,"to be fair, they had a smurf too"
333354,"hmm, i'm gonna bet on super mario and legend of zelda with updated sprites"
333695,well he shouldn't have been stealing all the kills!
333758,"yeah, thanks for explaining the yasuo and annie parts."
333948,yes the only ones who deserve to have an advantage are the ones who need to use it bc their inferior pc.
334144,"but she doesn't heal bro, shes not a support."
334179,yeah because outright banning them and making them rebuy the game is doing wonder for the game currently.
334372,"naw, shadowmere was from skyrim, not witcher, silly goose."
334551,"damn, the graphics has changed a bit since the last time i've played dishonored."
334641,just tighten up your aimbot a bit and you'll get it faster next time:)
334692,"i heard blizzard plans to release it on june 6, 6000"
335167,oh come on now.. maybe he was just holding his erect penis.. i think you're reading into things too much!
335278,"i suggest we give him both magic and physical damage, %hp damage on w passive, true damage on q passive and bloodseeker-like bleed effect on passive, which would skyrocket talon back to being meta and will be up to current standards"
335296,yeah cuz orgs have like no power in esports its all individuals and only the most skilled rise to the top
335423,because they don't have doa as coach.
335618,n0thing isn't even at this event
335673,"don't worry it's not important, everything is rigged anyway"
335710,good thing he did because i wouldn't have gotten the joke if he hadn't
335756,the game prevents you from switching heroes if there are more than one hanzo on the team.
335810,nice animation cancel on the jump
335863,its one of them old cd things isnt it?
335951,shaman tanks were removed in wod
335963,i've never actually seen a person get a headshot with hanzo on console.
335973,"that suicide after the ks, true alpha male."
336046,this hero will not be super fun to play on console ;-; i can barely reliably hit a tracer with winston
336077,because when you get dq'ed is like you never played the games
336078,i think it would be better to play 4v5 tho
336114,why use references if you can double the code
336116,"no, that was totally not intended, they just choice to invoke by accident."
336133,i need an epic username like mlgpro1995 or else who is going to take my montages seriously
336442,but he paid for those shoes that have pneumatic pistons on them
336551,well have you ever shot a punching bag irl?

336881,"if this game isn't 144 fps, then i riot"
336913,[apparently his voice files got replaced with the ones from legion where he is dying]
336953,this is that level from smash brawl right?
336990,"the graphs are, as always, the most informative information ever to have been released in known history"
337027,so lets just get rid of all his abilities and get rid of the damage he does and remove the shrikens too
337133,"yeah i mean lucian is strong but zed man, just so op!"
337155,"people pay more attention to the pros than the average player, because if it happens to a player it's human error, if it happens to a pro it's indubitably volvo's fault."
337165,wew he is korean (sorry if im wrong) that means he is not cheating and its just skill and good headphones.
337296,i believe they say cheating on lans is possible
337360,"conference in na, na favoritism!"
337372,but what ip will konami use for their pachinko machines if they sell them?

359261,if there won't be 3 years of urf on april 1 the prob no because it's too repetitive
359313,they just don't have the budget to make 1 of these super expensive videos
359401,"ip bonus =!= new season event but hey, you're smart, and nice."
359442,might as well close the entire eu forum cause no blizzard employee goes there anyways.
359538,because the ban message is on top
359576,two months later i can disprove op's ability to see the future.
359607,"that requires using your brain, would be easier to just bitch on reddit until riot makes the game easier for us."
359614,but... they're post-vac global so they're fake.

360022,"did you mean black people are jews, you racist?"
360032,"hell yeah, us teens need some cod or battlefield up in here."
360076,"i do realize he had lulu to back him up but still, pretty balanced am i right?"
360173,monte fanboys always there to defend him
360203,as the result lucian gets into jail aphro isnt allowed to play against kkk
360213,"don't worry, he will join fnatic next season when gamsu and spirit goes to na for money."
360232,"turns out, no bombs actually hit boston in the fallout universe."
360238,yeah i am sure he can just stay back and spam his q. because he has no mana or cooldowns.

360422,because minion block isn't a real thing
360424,"happy ofc, he always gets kills"
360450,"you're right, black ops 1, 2, and 3 are all literally the same thing."
360457,"clearly fake, bots never listen to what you tell them to do."
360476,yeah and riot is doing charity by giving players a salary for advertising
360508,"no man he al;so mildly resembles the opl logo, so representitive"
360517,you will when you will have a skin on them
360537,"nope, you get your console for $169.99 like everyone else."
360553,"i've tried that, i was able to ace their team but my team fed too hard"

360870,because trying new runes will make you play bad
360885,that's not the point... unless you dropped your
360933,no because it would make players comfortable with surrendering and then become toxic
360947,yeah because the guys who work on textures and models are the same ones who work on coding the game
360949,i remember when these were funny
360956,so if i would wait until december and make my promos i'll land in diamond?
361046,"it's pointleas mate, why take revive on a champ that never dies :)"

361952,"good for splyce, they really deserved this"
361976,"this literally breaks the whole thing, lazy devs fix asap"
361994,i think you're being downvoted because you forgot the
362044,another classic example of lazy devs!

362642,you're literally a nazi if you wear those.
362667,"good thing we have pbe, because nobody saw this becoming a problem a mile away"
362692,"the clip needed more action, explosions and drama."
362716,they should make dragon timer 15 seconds shorter to make up for the game starting 15 seconds shorter
362744,"yeah, bethesda needs to put a little fucking work into gif technology."
362752,yeah because fragadelphia was a super hard lan to win
362755,"nah man, low frags = bad player"
362766,"oh yes the quad awper lineup, that sounds really good"
362831,riot is a small indie developer and this is just part of having a lack of resources.
362851,but didn't you see the other day the froggen vs febiven yasuo vs fizz duel?
362857,*notices truck still on a site* nah i'll pass.
362906,columbus gee golly one of the biggest cities def gonna pack that stadium
362913,you clearly don't know how to use reddit.
362919,this is why we need fat acceptance
362924,because of all the news and things to talk about for live while beta is going on!
362936,i hate that shroud does nothing interesting outside of pubs... noob farmer is all he is clearly.
363004,"shh, only kaboom happened since s2."
363035,inb4 he has hacks and shows them off here to see if they are believeable
363059,pretty obvious marin is going to fnc right?
363063,clearly the reason other moba's players where sandbox is available are toxic.
363075,seems like pretty good ideas to me
363084,don't want to damage that thriving sc2 scene.
363087,"haha i made a spoderman of myself a few months back, i think it looks really damn good"
363131,because its full of guns and idiots!
363141,"i guess you could say, he literately_got_caner"
363199,"yeah, you would say that, you sjw."
363228,its fine the chinese $ will take care of lck as well by the time
363230,dude that extra mana is op haven't you heard?
363256,but riot is just a small start up who puts players first.
363415,maybe build a wall around the turrets so they are harder to hit?
364299,"shut up irelia, we don't judge people by their flairs, now go back to your top lane you overpowered bitch"
364669,i thought it was a type of robotic burn victim.
364808,"can't really tell, and not everyone puts the good"
364979,poe being sick the entire split?
365027,because ignoring someone is clearly as bad as taunting them after a victory.
365276,wow this completely sells me on vr...
365281,crafted golden deathwing i mean being the most useful card for being ahead but most useless when behind
365365,what if you just missed out on you're one true love?
365397,"you're right, mindlessly grinding hundreds of mobs manually is much more fun!"
365418,no one ever said that tsm is a good team
365657,"yeah as we all know na has much better raw aim than eu, the only thing that holds them back is the eu tactical ability."
365718,yea i agree every player in plat elo knows who you are and ghosts you
365745,fallen has never done anything wrong in his life and every play he makes is positive for his team
365777,i hope in next parts of your guide you included how to be toxic as riven in most efficient way?
365848,"i will continue to not swap talents for ishkar and nobody will stop me, tell the other dps to big dick harder"
365886,so youre telling me that the number 1 team in the world is australian?
366050,yeah all of them are trolls that are holding me back on silver.
366172,yeah who even cares about going platinum multiple times and winning various awards for music.
366326,i was gaming at a steady 15fps the other day and it looked great
366380,they're trying to make it look like they suck so the teams at the major will play no respect and then splyce will rek em with their mlg strats they prepared
366456,"right, because there is no propaganda in the east."
366470,"no he's talking about the us government official whose phone calls got leaked, victoria nuland, you know"
366547,you don't enjoy dealing with a level 1 perma stun brand who spams laugh until you die just because he wanted to pick a champ that literally makes you unable to play the game?
366695,because this one time he was playing and the 18-0 rengar one shot him from ult so he's op duh
366780,fuck the bug dude.the important thing is that this guy gets a better viewmodel.
366957,but i *need* those 57 styles of bracers on the off chance i might possibly think about changing my transmog.
367029,yeah especially with the caster pay standards
367315,he should start a team with qqube imo
367323,"right, it's not that lg is a better team, they just got lucky."
367340,i mean he's at a similar rank of nip
367360,"oh yeah, so creative how they copied one of the most popular and well know characters in video games"
367362,marxism and globalism is better
367429,"no, but you'll be able to play with your nordic and slavic brothers at eune"
367432,showing booty doesn't fit bayonettas character... oh wait
367475,totally relevant and productive comment...
367488,i'm so sorry that shroud and stewie ruined your souvenir.
367593,"nah, this is just his updated passive that they added in the patch"
367602,"they have to code in a whole new broccoli model, the technology just isn't here yet"
367607,"you clearly know nothing, they took turrets at level 2, it wasn't just farming!"
367619,get a second job and buy another xbox and tv!
367703,every game must be at least 100 hours!
367749,clearly riot is presenting numbers they know to be wrong because they want to defend dynamicq even though they know everyone hates it.
367754,"yeah, leveling should be the most grueling experience and if you don't like your class then deal with it"
367782,i don't think that many people bought the game
367889,carlisle typewriters or gtfo scrub
367892,"yeah, actually trying to beat your opponent is overrated"
367920,"you just code it into the game, it's not that hard"
367933,they could play a 3rd game to decide.
367996,rammus with 500 armor only gets 125 bonus ad.
368022,"yes, because there's so much pvp involved killing quest givers and lowbies."
368098,"he's playing with a hand injury since cluj , that's obvious !"
368131,"yeah, promote the games in the csgo sub, you will reach a lot of new players"
368158,[varian might have a hard time doing that.]
368165,"better remove those first 2 photos, they're too sexualized and don't fit her personality^"
368178,"how about me liking being a special snowflake, then?"
368201,"swap huni and turtle, that way huni can play carries and turtle can be frontline."
368208,yeah i'm sure the 4/1/3 zed needed that to 1v1 that vayne alright
368209,"yeah, 43% winrate as adc and 39% winrate as mid very balanced"
368257,"dang, almost could have had a scythe loli"
368279,"right, and im no flamer, im stating facts."
368290,"well, got my new leet rp figured out"
368410,"yeah, and they should add spells, magic and cooldowns for gun usage."
368552,"bard's ult costs 100 mana, it isn't free."
368630,"all hail cumshotgg, best owner in the west!"
368651,i thought it was supposed to be a premium controller!
368675,"this is clearly fake and done on a private server, no way there is such a thing as community on retail servers"
368727,"only reaosn i play league tbh , i love small indie companies."
368733,i can't wait to see if they continue the 500mb hard drive.
368779,"pff, no situational awareness, git gud"
368825,but then how will we protect our country from the coming terrorist invasion?
368918,yea once someone cheats in a video game they might as well have signed away their privacy the fucking scum
368919,"idk, something tells me that this game is an xbox one exclusive"
368957,"i agree, the mage updates and the introduction of the new dragons are extremely boring, i just want dfg and gold from dragon again."
368960,but its impossible to have fun unless every game mechanic stays exactly the same and your running speed is 20mph!
368961,i know man it's been long since illaoi has been released
368973,"i mean, yasuo does that with much less effort, don't see what the fuss is about"
368993,dude get out of here with your pro riot attitude
369003,he realized that he needed to sit out so their real best player vuggo could play instead to show that scrub how to play
369111,didn't you know that having fun is totally childish and the mature can't have fun?
369131,"oh well, if thoorin said so then it must be true"
369190,another great jacob wolf article with completely new information that no one knew yesterday!
369191,yup shen totally not viable in competitive play.
369208,it works wonders for dazed to not get pissed right ?
369230,yeah they probably never improved what so ever
369241,"you'd like that, wouldn't you white cis scum"
369298,"you are correct, using the logic of the two other dudes me might as call every jump shot a kqly shot, because obviously he was the first one to do it"
369399,"honestly he should be mana free too, zed and rengar are"
369436,"so let's take zz'rot and ohmwrecker out, as well as guardian angel because games end too fast anyway"
369447,"incoming jungle swain with extra minigames, dont worry you will love it"
369448,they were too busy listening to pro feedback on the r8
369512,just call him a shitcunt and ignore him
369548,don't you know that everyone lives in the us?
369562,yea those chat reactions were hilarious
369641,"yeah how unrealistic, a barren desert."
369666,redraw it so she's bottomless too
369675,if everything doesn't work like expected they can always switch to the na rain
369681,just wait til he reaches level 20.
369725,yes; he has one stacking passive; he is basically braum.
369745,ah right i forgot the random redditor knows more than the common consensus by the analyst community.
369820,why would m0e be in the top ten?
369838,"inb4 sandals will make less noisy steps, pay4win confirmed"
369863,get out of here with that logic!
369869,use the -5% death timer runes very handy now
369903,i'm sure it's just that simple to program.
369911,"i've seen a lot of people hacking in mm, must be replicating flusha"
370074,"somehow i don't think that's how it works, but i don't know enough about human existence to dispute it"
370138,"yeah, just like valkyria chronicles ii and iii!"
370153,"once you go healer, you're never allowed to go back."
370164,they got lucky and won worlds and also got lucky beating m5 the favourite of the whole tournament
370189,"lets just drop everyone an item worth more than the actual game, that makes a lot of sense..."
370211,because pbe servers have the same traffic as live servers across numerous regions.
370268,what's an nes i bet it sucks compared to my xbox one
370295,yeah let's use win rates as a measurement of the strenghts of a champion
370311,oh really now... guess i really have to use
370322,"didn't you read, it's his teammates that are getting killed"
370327,but wait does this work on windows 10?
370339,field left empty is obviously touchpad users
370452,are you sure it wasn't from $20-400?
370459,but i thought the ps4 was all shooters and remasters.
370494,what else is the downvote button used for?
370509,oh yeah women are so scary and terrible
370523,sounds like your living in 2014
370587,"*sits in my smug ivory g-sync tower* ah, the troubles of lesser folk!"
370610,"you have to be 17+ to play csgo i am reporting you to fbi, cia, obama, and peta obvious"
370681,honestly i feel like he was joking and thought people would catch on so he wouldn't need to use
370697,good thing rock star knows what we want and gives us more multiplayer updates!
370729,lol yeah i bet fnatic didn't prepare vs koo.
370890,"yeah, like it gonna change 90% of this form"
370893,there goes your only shot of being pro.
370908,"i wonder how long does destiny gonna survive like its curent state, its dead so good luck its year 2 from 10"
370945,they just need time to play together and build synergy
370976,yeah but this assassins creed game has a new texture and 2 new melee weapons from the last game!
371008,"yeh, nrg are being a really bad team with hermit, totally not one of the best na teams"
371111,praise be to the teambuilder gods that we can play who we want when we want where we want!
371112,"yeah, envyus play with plenty of brains"
371139,you mean playing with your knees on your chest isn't the way to play the game?
371142,well i mean poland wasn't that rough for hitler...
371170,surely +5 to +1 s on her w will make her balanced
371218,literally the only thing i wanted them to put in the game
371230,maybe next time he shouldn't even play the game instead of being so toxic all the time
371236,maybe you should set your primary as secondary and see if that works
371249,"its because the objective of the game is not to kill people, freak has god like aim"
371315,he knew cs was cool before all of us so don't question him
371408,when i dont use skins im flusha with skins im still flusha cuz skins dont matter
371434,because fnatic fanbase is known for not having a lot of bandwaggoners
371446,"yeah, i hated when they did that in super mario 64"
371493,why would they release a mass effect that ends 66% of the way through?
371524,sounded like a pompous apology to me!
371537,i like the way of fixing it by just removing the button.
371605,he would've won the 1v4 if the flash worked obviously..
371694,they ruined it because i'm not good at it.
371711,"yeah, because that's why you didn't get your invite."
371719,tfw they added jungle timers last season and now people who don't have enough mechanics to have 6 timers running in their heads simultaneously have gotten to challenger because rito's making the game easy
371781,"can confirm, balance breaking, inconsistent, accuracy bug makes 1.6 a better game"
371789,sometimes running accuracy can be a little ridiculous
371808,but how can we win in pbe if all the op champs arent banned
371883,"yeah, because i can make oddshots longer than 40 seconds."
371888,too bad i cant find any sg553 only servers
371902,"what, you don't like protoss-hair widowmaker?"
371907,inb4 you get banned for hurting the computer's feelings.
371952,beacuse tf2 got so many good weapons!
371974,"yeah, i was silver 2 pre-vac, now after vac its so easy i am smfc now in a span of couple of months."
372003,no dude you should play like warowl said or watch tournaments what pros do or just go play cod
372022,especially without a man's permission!
372037,how else are they gonna get the game out there to all those people who will not experience the beta!
372059,bro anyone with a few days practice can hold a constant ~290 while bhopping.
372092,"ugh, here bethesda goes with another huge immersion breaker"
372107,can't though if your not japanese
372127,the building the most creative penis tournement is probably gonna be the best e-sports tournement of the year!
372154,"well the solution is obvious, make a baby dragon spawn at 1;55 that can be taken at level 1 so team objectives are still relevant"
372192,when i die in a hundred years i want to go to hell just so i can kill you again you son of a bitch!
372193,just working on my resume now for an lcs team staff spot
372195,characters having names are my trigger
372277,"jin air could have been a semi final team, kt a semi final team, and ever"
372299,but it only has 4 maps because i only bother to do a fraction of the content
372310,lmao yea let them go to america where they cant even go safely to church or the movies or even get shot by a police officer
372422,"yeah, thats why you can shoot from headshot angles."
372439,why would we need you to do this?
372443,"yeah, we should remove 4 of her spells then she'll be balance"
372458,those 30 rounds are warmup for overtime.
372461,making a game is just dragging and dropping assets into the engine.
372480,what about america bombing foreigners wouldn't a christian woman like?
372564,"oh yeah, the last two wc were just bullshit"
372565,i see you've read up on those feminist strats.
372574,its okay to be griefing assole if it is funny right ?
372585,"yeah, looks like he is actually seized"
372592,"oh sorry, i didn't know that in your country people don't know what paragraphs are ^"
372645,oh... this is the first time im seeing this
372654,getting interrupted before the cast bar even appears on my screen is fun too
372670,"rofl eu is literally na lcs now, just full of recycled mediocre shit players outside of og/h2k, can't wait to see sick plays by gilius, jebus &amp; creaton"
372685,so this is why nothing ever happens...
372697,"documentary on c9 team that puts up zero results internationally, yeah real interesting"
372714,bora is yellowstar good luck skyping with the new tsm support!
372725,well thank god ebola is help fight the war on overpopulation
372739,because games for windows live was such a huge success.
372743,"yeah because people are totally implying piglet singlehandedly carried skt, good save man"
372744,hahaha its so original and funny.
372781,"cause nobody on those gambling sites plays when their under 21, duh"
372823,only le 90s kids will remember those gems.
372833,"and i still didn't get an invite, i fucking hate this shit."
372983,damn i've been doing it wrong this whole time
373128,dev1l and pyth so good rosterchanges kreygasm
373886,yeah u are right better do nothing and keep losing
373889,all those strategy games yet no strategy for your wallet.
374056,right because all those champs are bad and are 1 item away from being top picks.
374395,til that someone is that far behind in knowing people have been doing that for ages
374425,this punishes people that get full build before 20 minutes
374483,"i'm suprised he shaked dl's hand, double clg fine"
374485,this will stop people flaming trick2g for d gatez
374499,"you don't understand, it won't split the community; everybody will play the superior big d queue to prove their true worth to the elo gods!"
374763,"thats it, everyone in mm that rapes me is using this cheat!"
374874,but there's an info booth right there
375020,because things like this are so easy to set exact dates on.
375121,"yes, waiting is always with riot"
375359,redditors are lost without their precious
375447,i pick him specifically to farm waves and don't even rank ult which doesn't help me do that.
375668,"no, i'd rather play 5000 matches of arms race."
375792,yes because nd is known for lack of quality...
375914,how do they plan to sell the new soraka skin with that insane nerf
376290,awesome that they're never releasing this for pc
376404,"i get those flamers that tell me i should go get cancer and that my family should all die in a fire, but you know they totallly shouldn't get banned.."
376518,it bugged me so much that rengar didn't go ap :( too much power for one man to comprehend
376545,what if he said this to reveal the whole major is scripted
376562,"and making cortana voice commands exclusive for kinect its a dumb move, am i right guys?"
376577,"it was just over of their plan, now if they beat gambit they won't have to play fnatic in the quarters, and they can now get even more prize money if they reach semis"
376628,"yeah, his predictions is always on point.."
376648,i would pick the random button!
376737,because backwards compatible games shouldn't be playable on the xbox one
376785,"oh shit 5 people,that's a large enough sample size"
376857,"the only children that care are old enough for it not to matter, except to god!"
376896,i bet the rest of fnatic aren't too pleased with flusha right now
376955,"i wish i could be a bald generic big abs and pecs dude like in every video games :( but you know, with the male supremacy the society have its ok if we feel inferior to the models video games have..."
377088,"just wait till next month man, it'll be free."
377118,this time cod is in space though so it will obviously be revolutionary!
377122,hey did you know that if you put your email and password in a xbox message it auto blanks it out?
377163,i really have no clue what you are talking about
377186,you'll get out of silver 1 after losing enough ;) makes perfect sense...
377222,yes that's why starcraft wasn't popular at all
377232,"hair isn't dirty enough, literally complete garbage."
377239,i guess some people might get offended and request all titans to wear pants
377296,yeah they should just replace everything with dev textures
377307,at least we got draven bobbleheads
377477,and it only took them 17 weeks and three intervening non-snapshot releases!
377528,i learned this from playing video games!
377554,it's by far the best thing about the game you've missed out on so much
377597,"yea sure, and i trusted alex rodriguez when he said he didn't use peds."
377661,"i downvoted, because i'm a night elf mohawk irl"
377662,no casuals are allowed near my warcraft movie
377771,"yeah, i always wondered why do i hear tsm chants when chinchongs are playing on stage."
377804,he might actually finally reform after watching this...
377805,yeah because those that main supports will stop putting support as their primary
377908,yeah beacuse lets just keep quiet about everything wrong about the world and hope it just fixes itself
377920,"blizz (11/13/2014): omg guys wod is here, get pumped... yearly expansions are going to be amazing!"
377921,gotta love games that are decided in champ select
377953,"sunfire, taunt, 3 q procs, maybe a wit's end... yeah mostly physical damage"
377985,"good thing you posted this, he barely gets any recognition when he streams."
378006,i don't think he's at the level c9 is looking for being a t1 team and all..
378009,must be why those madden games don't sell
378038,"bethesda, masters of jumping animations"
378066,-edward +adren since he played so well at the major for liquid
378110,"blizzard is making him do this, can't you see?"
378120,a family that plays together ended up hating each other
378138,"ikr, korea has never won or even shown up in any international competition, totally irrelevant and weak."
378178,wow you're not supposed to downvote based on opinion
378214,how long before riot tells ogn to stop using booths?
378219,because lulu was the factor in todays games right?
378251,"these type of knives have been banned by the geneva convention, so i doubt they'd put it in the game"
378290,"so get up get, get down, xbox live is a joke in yo town."
378369,by the way things are looking there will only be 4 players.
378376,it would be really good if you could use your trinket on someone like malphite and not allow him to use his ultimate on 10 secs
378383,but developers said was super hard to do that when asked about ps4k
378397,maybe casting in warcraft require both hands?
378405,"yeah, about 3 years ago we adopted that rule and it has gone swimmingly so far."
378445,"ah yes.. akali, the staple of high skill cap champions."
378446,i guess it must be me because apparently windows phone has just as many great games as iphone and android that i've simply managed to miss over the course of two years...
378449,nah men an xin with 1 attack speed item who clicks e q and your dead was super fun
378468,it's because tsm lost and all their tsm marketing material for msi is wasted.
378477,"no it's a joke, and a sarcasm is"
378527,doesn't count as a remaster if it's got the same graphics.
378530,"no, all this mindless killing might make people not focus on the objectives and just lead to death matching"
378539,"yeah, but it's only about 99.9% science based"
378541,"every team uzi's in has some kind of drama, he's clearly the root of all problems"
378575,and just like that all my desires to pvp in legion vanish.

378715,"we don't need this, we have mario maker!"
378770,i think you guys all know more about who would be a better support for the team than the actual team themselves who know the game at an extremely higher level
378795,na dude his probably just vaced from unreal tournament
378851,"how could i possibly focus on the objective, when there's so much map to explore?"
379004,well yeah if they moved they might have lost that super important mastery bonus

379123,yes because that makes it perfectly okay.
379173,games these days just can't keep up with true classics like black ops 2 and bf4.

379367,thanks reddit keyboard warriors!
379368,so you startet playing world of warcraft?

379665,is that why they've been throwing their past few matches?
379714,"yeah, why judge somebody by their actions when you can ignore it all and be a fanboy regardless of what they do"

379739,she has crazy damage when building ap
379771,"and here i am, still trying to find the physical triforce in ocarina of time."

379942,"i'm glad that valve is finally focusing time and money on the real issues and ignoring the community's outrageous demands for higher tick rate servers, stronger vac, balanced guns, or something as ridiculous as a new operation."
380026,at least they are giving a precise window
380080,how's scream allowed to compete?
380188,"brand does more with pillar of flame lvl 1, clearly brand is easy to play."
380207,"nah, it'll be a 'games with gold' next month."
380237,"yeah, all games are the problem, the cpu isn't."
380248,because we all know how valve likes to drop updates on wednesdays
380252,i see no way that this could be abused.
380261,but what about all the deagle wallbangs i get?
380271,"scripting, if he actually was scripting he wouldn't have lost his momentum at the last jump in kitchen, he also would have gained a lot more speed."
380277,i love the fact you've been downvoted for stating a fact... i remember when reddit worked on the basis that the downvote button wasn't a disagree with someone's opinion button
380278,what they going to do redeem and play them?
380279,spamming ranged attacks makes you so pro
380326,at least he didn't say could of
380409,the easy fix is to not do anything get you flamed
380445,"personally, i find playing with friends and winning to be even more fun than one or the other, but maybe they disagree."
380462,it must not be spoken about here
380496,making room to put urf in permanently
380500,dont worry man dynamic queue rank means just as much as solo rank!
380523,"yea, that was the most disappointing part of the game."

380862,only the black model can do this btw guys
380871,can they make it any more t sided?
380904,the thooorin/adren banter would be fun.
380912,"all bronze players are obviously held back by eachother, so they all deserve plat"
380946,ok since you brought the topic up i wanted to suggest some buffs for kindred: q :stuns for 2 sec (which is how much q needs to come back up with w on) w: gives passive attack speed (lets say 50%) and blinds every auto e: now stuns and after the proc it heals you for 500 hp at max level and has an ad scaling nuke with 500 base dmg (added to the % dmg) r: now only makes your team members unable to die and heals team members inside it to full health
380961,just what everyone has been asking for - 2 more levels of valor!
380963,if you don't let a bunch of immigrants a refugees come into your country and make it much worse your country is full of assholes...
380987,we ain't all from florida or cali..

381159,"please make it for a 6300 champ, even better if i don't own it"
381169,and they say the community is toxic!
381174,because when doublelift loses he's just some idiot adc
381209,i hope its crimson elite (best skin in the game)
381212,"well, if it was within camera-shot of the kinect, the nsa has a copy of it..."
381234,it's great that a developer can rely on modders to do their work for them.
381246,it would be sick to see when someone got an mvp for planting the bomb...
381281,"dont say that shit here man inven will go bat shit on this and proceed to pummel na, eu and china scene in whole, calling rest of region as wild cards"
381344,i hope it tastes really good because the graphics look like something you'd see on a cake in 2008.
381346,ea probably should've thrown more money at them for a better score.
381379,"but he's lem, he knows better than that dmg scrub."
381381,he must've got the new update early then
381412,"no, you're supposed to make a claim and then provide zero proof cause"
381418,"drop him from the team, hes the worst player"
381454,but we don't need another content patch because of the faster expansion cycle
381539,yeah because 1 minute of your life that you spend playing league and browsing the league subreddit is valuable
381556,its better that you lose and the troll wins
381560,obviously if it has better graphics it will influence them more
381589,"no, it's always fun to lose bf sword to avarice blade"
381630,because screw you if you're having a good time!
381633,how can you have a good time without a minimum steady 30fps?
381635,well i mean it's my go to but i didn't realize that many people were hand coding html and other shit on ps4
381644,all u have to do is change the server max limit gawd blizzard
381670,yeah having three fully completing items at 22 mins sure makes warlord's bloodlust op
381676,yeah fuck those people who buy games they enjoy instead of taking pointless stands over petty politics!
381721,"buy him a few bags of doritos, a sixpack mtn dew and call of duty"
381726,that would be too generous for riot
381733,"just rage at your teammates, the warmth from your breath will spread around your room and your hands will warm up"
381757,"yeah, fuck those roles, who wants them anyways?"
381779,totally worth the 250 gold cost.
381821,"yeah all the bugs, glitches, incomplete dialogue, bad optimization, spelling errors, and old engine *really* polish it off to be a completed game."
381875,"you may restart, but it's by bethesda law that you must play on survival difficulty with hud opacity turned to 0!"
381879,but reddit said lee sin was buffed this patch
381880,"but it isnt toxic, rito and lyte said so much about non toxic environment being better for game..."
381960,i know right tsm shouldnt siege at all and let minions do work on towers
381962,"because of iem and their shitty setups, technical difficulties after every game"
381982,wait the downvote isn't a dislike button?
382001,less time spent runes r new meta due to the new death timer changes

382201,yeh better make his ult oneshot everyone it hits
382215,why not just make maps with plain cubes and boxes?

383217,"you know the rule: *as long as it happens within a prison*, rape is hilarious and something to joke about."
383345,so you're saying that you have a 120hz monitor?

384027,"yeah, one of them is showing enemy who is premade in your team"
384099,"germans obviously have the most efficiently coded hacks, otherwise they would be top"
384162,as we all know scims are serious business
384399,so i'm sure soaz getting solo killed by adc as quinn when he initiated the fight by himself was team communication problem huh
384449,well when i was 1-17 my system would shut down immediately at 23:00 so it's an efficient system.
384516,yeah a virus specifically designed to try and wipe out 90% of the population as well as the city being fairly dangerous to walk around unless armed shouldn't mean that there aren't millions of npc's roaming the streets.
384568,this is a helpful and informative response.
384614,call of duty: why are you still playing
384818,"yeah it's an every day avarage zed play, right?"
384930,i mean... he does have a tsm flair... :\^)
385093,actually it's a flash not a frag...

385418,"commented before you edited^lol^rip anyways, yeah he had his ping on 3fiddy"
385448,"that's right riot, buff ahri, she was at 52% winrate but it's not enough, she needs to be at 55%"
385687,because he has strategical mind and great tactical sense of the game
385702,"yeah srsly, i don't get why you should get a ban for this ... i always write things like that and never got banned."
385759,but in league we only get a 4% drop chance for gems!

385806,nice try to increase your chances to get a juicy souvenir drop
385926,"cool, i was wondering when your next video was coming out."

387407,what a waste of perfectly fertile land.
387420,"yeah other teams dont play double tp , dont use them better and dont know the current meta better than clg"
387472,"eh, they are probably gonna release a new zyra skin at some point which will bring infinitely more money in than the washed up release skin so why should they bother."
387493,"but if i, guy with 10 alts fully levelled can with 5 friends and resources of thousands of gold do it under 5 hours then every noob can do it!"
387494,he's playing ad thresh you nob he isn't tank

387711,"what kind of idiot would want to transfer characters they have spent time and effort on, just make a new character you absolute noob"
387745,that emote totally doesn't fit her personality and the play of the game only focuses on the neck down.
387781,maokai is a very balanced champion because his high base damage make up for low scaling and his lack of cc and survivability.
387821,dont need official if its over twitter!
387900,how about a mode where death timers are shortened and turrets are buffed
387905,this is why *every* joke in this community needs a

388854,free keys for running through overwatch cases sounds good to me
388888,i hope they support it like the 360/ps3 versions!

402481,you mean the downvote button isn't a disagree button?
402893,god forbid you tell people about alternatives in a positive and non forceful manner
402924,obviously there's not enough data to warrant one
402968,yeah i also agree with all these bronzies with a master yi flair who are totally not biased and know exactly what they are talking about.

404521,"they just removed his e, but i didn't knew alistar had a passive"
404593,"lol, yes this will totally work"
404679,look at mr fancy pants here with his international vacations.
404804,"yes, because a 770 is such a low end, budget priced, entry level, inferior to all things card..."
404867,the 'family' event got canceled due to a certain blizzard... oh darn!
404962,graves clearly outplayed her through the advanced mechanic of auto attacking with only two shots in succession.
405009,"no you are confused with the ps4.. xbox plays used games, it's the ps4 that doesn't."
405017,not interested in lore unless it's in the form of grimoire cards.
405019,"a nice message on esea, must be fake"
405042,man maybe blizzard should remove all over the shoulder poses now since its so offensive
405044,yes because computing power is getting more expensive day by day... check out this 32mb graphic card i got for $600 today!
405078,tl;dr: left click throws them the fastest.
405097,"yea, cause ekko needed the buffs he recently got lol"
405105,"it's free... free if air doesn't come on a disc, i wont get it"
405154,and her e.. and her prenerf w.. lets just remove it kek.
405354,"i first thought you were being serious, but the not tan enough made me realize you needed a"
405434,clearly someone hacked your minecraft and burnt everything in lava!
405487,"oh i'm so certain of that...who cares, i don't know why you're all so up in arms about it, if you think you're good, keep thinking that, it'll go far."
405516,"wow na crowds, not even staying after the major"
405614,"yeah man totally worth it, every team needs someone to lower the team morale every game"
405626,clearly it's going to be -freak +summit na's last hope.
405668,this confirms shovel knight is coming to smash bros.
405756,"you don't have a skin, what did you expect?"
405789,"yeah, the steady rise in subscriptions from the end of wotlk to the end of wod is really proof of this"
405801,2.96% clearly has a 2 so it cannot be 3%
405804,"oh, i'm sure bottom tier teams in other games are so much more exciting to watch get stomped at every major in csgo and dota2, right?"
405852,just like they did with the new maw!
405862,yeah 60 fps but you lose fuel and sharpness twice as fast
405878,gg riot eu gets everything riot so biased
405879,"if only na wasn't only the usa, clearly no northern country"
405880,"man, then i can't play my ap teemo bot"
405908,"oh look, a picture of a last of us copy, what fantastic content."
405918,but if esports pros aren't just lucky losers playing video games for a living how am i supposed to stifle my insecurities?
405990,"damn, i thought he was going to admit to it!"
406012,yes because using a command that defaults to the moving key as a reason to kick people makes total sense
406013,yes because they never changed anything since it released
406017,yeah we shouldn't be able to fix our teammates bad decisions with our good decisions!
406070,but if you take it out the arch might fail and the building will collapse!
406110,yeah he should have been able to just shrug off witnessing his entire clan's slaughter as a kid.
406130,we should start gathering signatures to force them to change the ending now
406183,he also solo killed faker so he's at least as good as febiven
406196,great sample size from an unbiased reference point
406300,"yes, it might be better if blizz decides to not release the game and make it only available to the current playerpool that only contains super nice guys like you, sir..."
406301,c'mon folks... aren't you excited about oculus social?
406336,"yeah that'll keep the pace in my games going, i love 40 minute games while winning decently hard!"
406352,"hes just better than you, stop calling cheats on everyone that kills you"
406445,clutch just like those clutch thresh lantern saves.
406487,"what do you mean man, it's like mad max over here."
406509,lets remove the camera on players its also not necessary.
406547,yeah those protect the doublelift team comps were just funneling resources all over the place.
406567,i wonder how soccer players handle this outright unhuman surroundings during a soccer match.
406755,it doesn't update itself on its own.
406878,oh my god aphromoo is so toxic.
406896,but dude havnt you seen clg's map movement?
406939,also a red mountain on the right!
407015,shit support didn't help her with them
407060,so casters have more time for epic banter :p
407064,"no man, 3-1 means crush, 3-0 means stomp, 3-2 means close series."
407096,dazed tested it so it must be true tho.. what does wada know about drugs anyway?
407123,"yes, let me make an point utilizing my utter daftness to create an oxymoron."
407138,"you see, it took 8 years for blizz to develop the technology to put the park in!"
407174,"yes, let's give tyler more attention, yay."
407208,"cd project stop making fun games, you're only allowed to create walking simulators now"
407243,"sorry, didn't know ranks had anything to do with you enjoying the game"
407246,csgo wild is probably paying this guy to gamble
407305,nice to give your future dinner a name
407389,yeah let's give everyone global rank so they have more fun playing the game
407407,yeah but s1mple isnt a top ten swedish player either
407436,i assume that your favorite color is green ?
407485,"yeah, lets go fund a company that does ps exclusives and fucks up their crowdfunded games!"
407543,hey maybe i'll be able to rank back up from nova after this back to where i should be at mg
407559,maybe map creators need to step their game up.
407570,"no, valve should making them take classes to help them not be shady fucks anymore!"
407577,but now optic can take their place!
407659,yeah but that's cause the rest of her kit is meh.
407722,"because the price is so low that compared to college, they're practically giving away all that valuable learning and experience!"
407757,liquid and cis had an export / import deal ...
407849,nope all riot support workers check reddit before they check support tickets so it was smart to post it here.
407858,glad to see they aren't selling a clg icon this year...
407885,but we need more tahm kench shenanigans
407897,if you were a real tank you'd play with your wa menu showing all the time.
407976,"title is misleading, he was mg1 before the rank update"
408114,"definitely all on poe everyone else is playing like they were at worlds, and their pick/bans are perfect"
408148,"because most people bother reading the manual before using a product, of course."
408157,yeah other people afk so why can't i?
408178,a sample size of 1 game is definitively enough to judge tsm.
408179,that one vp vs ldlc game would like to talk to you
408202,"there are no cheaters in cs, you are just playing against people who are better"
408261,hey bro the new ranking system isnt giving people there real ranks
408271,because it is something new and well you know...people are afraid of changes.
408274,and fps drops 50+ because this graphic update.
408289,i'm forced because i need to see if i win my bet
408321,"they tested it on the biggest platform , na , and it was fine."
408328,yeah cuz eu is like this for all year.
408332,don't forget euw testing and reliability
408364,"but he's the best player in the world, if it wasn't for his team"
408369,"yeah, they made his autos the way they are cause they don't want him jungling."
408445,"this can't be true because last time i heard, nintendo abandoned the wii u years ago..."
408517,i wonder why their title was named what it was then.
408561,"i am, it's mostly due to having a tiny mousepad so i've just got used to using my wrist, plus those mouse lifts give me flusha like aim."
408587,"yeah, that's just walking around money for me"
408627,"i think we, the community, would benefit from a second heartseeker annie skin as well."
408648,"sorry, you're gonna have to wait for wow to come to ps4"
408666,real women have dicks you cisscum
408732,nope i'll be basing all future decisions on your reviews
408737,but xbone said that new gen consoles are by far better than high class pc pls
408821,season 5 bot lanes must be avenged!
408830,"oh yes, i totally enjoy playing a 1vs1 custom bot game instead of going soloq/normals"
408836,rain looks different with a bittle of stubble
408847,"this is gonna be such a shit game, where is my second chance perk or marathon pro."
408880,"trick already played it in lcs, he just got the wrong build, he should have go for ap udyr"
408900,simpsons is definitely a kids cartoon
408930,yeah paying for all those skins in hots give you a real advantage.
408943,ye m8 haha didn't even make it to 892 what a fucking casual
408980,"well he just had a small loan of one million dollars of his father, life has been hard on him, give him some slack."
408999,no dude he knows how phones work.
409080,because if you use even one smiley face you are apparently a cringe person who tries to be le epic xd :p
409120,we should probably remove all stuns too because that is time where you can't do anything
409163,rengar is easy to counter tho just build zhonyas!
409164,"but really, why does scream use qszd?"
409175,"i've seen that time thrown around a lot, does it have some special meaning?"
409179,yeah i get qss first item on every champ now
409215,yeah because gay is a fucking bad thing to be e:
409221,"you're not having fun unless you're spending money though, you just don't get it!"
409225,"thank you for the clarification, i tried to write it in all chat and team chat, was confused why it didn't work."
409229,through extensive prayer and meditation.
409346,yes but they have the premier caster deman
409347,wasn't gonna buy it but those 4 copies of dying light have swayed me
409418,lose sean gares and pick up stewie2k is a great idea and that's all i'll say...
409472,"they addressed bastion already, he doesn't have a shield now."
409523,"agreed, don't bring your logic nonsense in here, either of you."
409524,b-but.. the glitches are because of the animus..
409560,and the cs community and scene should know this because we all follow dota
409626,who has time to read tutorials and in-game dialogue/text!
409637,seems about right for australia.
409643,man i'm so excited for when this happens the day the division releases.
409644,"you cold hearted asshole, how dare you prefering something done by a scrub in the new time over the work of someone who passed away ?"
409651,yeah just like you can't cheat in vac secured servers
409734,still a good pick up as a marksman for the greek army
409755,this totally makes that 45% cdr rumble that was posted the other day viable
409777,he better qs that at market max before the dupes bring it down to $100
409828,"no, fuck microsoft, the other guy told me all i need to know."
409859,"yeh, i mean gangplank has had absolutely zero nerfs since his rework"
409877,game at top is influenced by uncharted right?
409911,apparently season 4 never happened because tsm and c9 are trash low tier na lcs teams
409925,"this is racist to the undead, why do they always have to be shown with protruding bones?"
409937,but it wasn't an attack therefore it can't be sad
409955,"nah man, we use cheap shag in the usa all the time"
409972,whoa dude never seen someone do that before that was so fucking cool man
410018,"i mean they won envy on cobble today, it's not that far off"
410025,i bet it was his teams fault for not following up
410032,specs: idk really bad computer from 2006 64tick=40-50fps 128=30-40fps this is the best computer you can get!
410035,"nonsense, not like you could carry some bronze shitter up to diamond with a 4man premade, no way"
410050,nah he has a 51% winrate he's obviously owerpowered and lulu who has a 48% winrate needs a buff
410081,"player with 1700elo placed in bronze 3 cuz he lost a few games during the placements, having team with every border there is and all being below bronze 1, yea fun time"
410090,physically speaking a flip knife would be the smallest i guess.
410092,look at those ugly tire treads...obviously not much has changed graphically from profesional farmer 2015.
410114,other than that it is totally similar
410146,it would probably go to ti6 prize pool.
410150,yeah after s4 you were certainly going through hard times
410160,yeah man bjergsen would've killed them both with auto attacks only
410209,but the ps4 runs games at 4k 60 fps
410265,"season 6 baby, victorious ao shin will be yours!"
410282,"yes, preferring to concentrate on reactionary spell casting, totems, pets, aoe rotation, maelstrom procs and cooldowns instead of having to do the same thing with an added and unnecessary resource management system is lazy."
410284,tsm so good they infiltrate other regions' top 4 ^
410325,i think the randomrambo kick from fpl is more important.
410412,because presences make the game too hard
410451,as tf main - it works as expected.
410482,"because having the opposite opinion of the majority just means he's bad at the game, right?"
410536,yeah i don't deserve to take that much damage if i get hit with 20 skillshots in a row.
410542,"yep, froggen's anivia was only banned cause he could cs so well, no other reason"
410577,"dude, no one here has a girlfriend"
410580,"i mean they did add st music kits, jussayin"
410607,"yeah, how did they get the time to make this, oh wait, nevermind, it could be the pbe where the skin is already for a while."
410636,is the one on the right from the pc version?
410647,maybe they don't want to mix them up with the dota 2 team og?
410666,omg he still lives at home with his 20 years what a loser
410722,so instead of making proper sentences you make a giant paragraph and put all the unused periods at the end of it?
410725,fucking pros smurfing as globals.
410751,pretty surprised that's all you had to download when it's like 3 years worth of content
410762,you're telling me they nerfed the wrong champion
410792,it must gave been off-topic or factually wrong not because people disagree
410834,we obviously need to worry about how other people are enjoying the event and whether we can hear them or not.
410894,thankfully they removed local co-op in the latest halo so no one else will have to suffer through the hell you went through.
410925,they do that just to keep in line with the worst na team
410927,"yeah, let's all hail ubisoft titles now"
410934,found the person who got into beta
410940,"or, and god forbid this is true, people from eu are allowed to like na teams and use their flair themselves."
410979,but cops have to do this because these people are *dangerous* and going to kill people.
411086,good use of that education you're paying for
411537,you were aiming to high and didn't stop moving.
411720,"i like farming under tower with swain, its so easy and fun!"
411721,nah i like it when paladins come and fuck all the mobs up then bubble and fly away like nothing happened
411722,no i'd rather complain about why i end up dodging and losing lp because i forgot to lock in my champ that literally takes 1 fucking click and .1 seconds
411920,this is a copy of geometry dash life
412485,"oh, is this that new garry's mod modpack?"
412571,"yes, flusha and other pros are too proud to use such a noob script."
412727,"it was obviously all bait, look at how it turned out"
412786,fnc is a uk org so we're no1 actually.
413089,will role out with solo q for all the other regiona
413111,oh cmon selfie should definitely be in c tier above eika
413112,but he has like 10 friends so its a big sample size to come up with the conclusion
413217,i didn't realize gpus weren't electronic.
413389,i don't understand rumble has enhanced ap on his autos whenever i play him
413408,wow i totally didn't expect so many nip fanboys
413545,i absolutely can't wait to experience all of the ps3's aaa games re-remastered in brand new ultra hd!
413556,turns out nip it still the best team ever
413598,should've just used the panorama feature on the iphone
413720,no it's because of first shot inaccuracy valvo plz fix
413970,but reddit told me that the skin is shit because of the model!
414168,"shhh, riot is the greatest company ever and you're just a hater for saying otherwise."
414196,"well, reignover doesn't have mvp ability"
414208,what if thats what they intended it to be
414235,a windows machine would definitely be better for running all of my unix applications
414255,yeah 1-5 when everyone else on his team has similar scores is intentionally feeding
414292,but then we won't get to listen to the ~~annoying~~ insightful eu vs na banter!
414296,"sooo, just fire everybody from literally every other team and replace them with people for the soloq team."
414409,fkin teammates always stealing muh frags
414551,kameo sequel for xbox one confirmed.
414639,because the major isn't sponsored by the score app
414651,yea if only your screen changed when you queued up...
414667,ummm riot nerfed that build it said so in the patch notes.
414678,asking for a refund on my hornet now... this is unacceptable!
414711,but didn't you looove the chess minigame?
414725,if you don't have 128 fps u can't handle 128 tick ffs
414728,probably the most serious question i've seen all day.
414745,and half of them using alts to get !drops
414754,but how is this possible if there are only 5 people on earth
414805,wordtwisting: the highest form of debate
414916,it would be better if he was driving a subaru forester
415037,no... riot knows whats best for us.
415061,"yeah true, he was so garbage when gob b was leading mousesports"
415065,"very true, i mean last playoffs they only had six wins!"
415099,s1mple leaving liquid confirmed
415106,well riot can't help you because be changed his name
415151,liquid's gbjames followed me on twitter (most likely by accident since we don't have anything in common) liquid are most definitely going to sign me
415268,can complexity count as a uk team ?
415315,"cant have any e-stalking going on, cmon man"
415331,"yes, i'm sure the vast majority of gamers are *actually* people with mental disabilities who literally can't think for themselves."
415393,yea so cool to have a coach who basically cheats...
415411,"na dog, you don't get it mmo's are hard to make so they need to cost more money"
415412,yeah i really would love an ak with a wooden and metal aesthetic
415454,"i was playing thresh with some friends (side note, i suck at thresh but i have fun playing him) i landed every like 2/5 hooks or less, then enemy rengar says: you only won because thresh carried all 4 of you, when i saw that i told my friends, guys just remember that i carried all of you and i main thresh now."
415533,but riot never says they were wrong
415543,"don't worry, no gungans, only gungeons."
415575,not sure if you are serious or not but your wording reeked of
415645,"he explained the situation: i was dealing with trolls.. just take it at face value, right?"
415678,b bu... but you d do don't really w want th that.
415687,look at all those renamed bots u killed
415711,they could fix this but they couldnt fix the damn yasuo bugs
415714,"not quite top gear, but alright i guess"
415880,did lyte give you this statistic?
415884,i'm sure they will fix yasuo bugs with this assassin update
415885,graphics look *amazing* in this game what is it?
415894,obviously needs to be nerfed again
416009,you can't complain about crappy programming unless you're a programmer!!
416016,now im gonna feel sorry for every cs i take on the rift.
416060,damn i wish i followed the korean scene
416128,we guys heard you guys in eu like bad montages
416144,"its ok to trash talk strangers, but not ex-teamates."
416152,honestly the fact that she is not reading war and peace while farming hfc mythic means you have failed
416163,because damage done is exactly based on performance
416166,"yep, they didn't even win counter pit, dh leipzig, or iem san jose!"
416176,i'm method's recruitment officer
416183,isn't fb supposed to always refresh rip?
416269,"lol yeah there were no other variables, the only thing that changed was the region amirite?"
416295,"why wont that bastard just read all the rude shit i write at him, what a pussy"
416306,all he did was get resets and press w a few times
416352,"at least you guys can still play the greatest spider-man game, the amazing spider-man 2."
416403,"your friend was right, that was only a 270 degree noscope"
416434,typical of what i've come to expect from blizzard.
416437,"yes, same way that skyrim is a terrible game with no depth"
416452,i appreciate your contribution to the discussion.
416511,"can confirm, me has mechonix but bronze teammate drags me down"
416631,i'm sure they'd get banned from esl for serving adult beverages.
416656,playstation now is the same thing as backwards compatibility!
416660,yay for sweeping statements about a whole fanbase!
416668,i feel like u should list out all the other sites where its done instead of saying its done everywhere
416724,watch out calling that anime triggers some people
416739,it probably mutated with all the radiation and such
416754,"yeah, who cares if he's toxic if he's nice to the idiots that watch and donate."
416935,but then your stupid teammates can't hear how much you despise them
416937,next you'l be telling me skadoodle is pronounced dave.
416963,til an organization name directly convert all of their players' skill into the org's primary game.
416975,mods showing their hypocrisy once again with a shit post of their own...
416995,you can't tax someone if he votes on another politician ofcourse
417175,yeah it's not a bug until it happens 3 times
417310,"yeah, he's clearly an elite player like kennys, guardian or jw."
417313,"yeah, last of us, journey, portal 2, mass effect 2... all trash."
417316,and in more recent operations : zoo
417325,"well it wasn't going to fit in the xbox in the plastic, duh"
417366,he meant to commit keikaku actually
417385,"do a search for the term, 'multiplayer'."
417392,"yes, he is meany man who bullied babam man..."
417479,solution: only play on the left side of any given map.
417483,"oh golly, this will get microsoft on my side!"
417556,hey calm down he is global elite his flair says so
417575,yeah because that's been amazing so far
417576,but all of my justified pre-orders!
417582,no one is hyped not like they have a competetive history
417600,thx for replying; your comment is really important to me.
417620,yeah because there are thousands to choose from in challenger who are also doing the same queue.
417632,by the end of this i will be able to play mm in eu without a problem thx starladder
417640,yeah dude you didn't know this?
417675,but aren't people always honest about their rank?
417702,that's why the vita is such a resounding success that all developers are dying to put games on it.
417712,"sorry, i sould be posting about world peace here."
417728,"nah bro you got to get that lossless audio, you can totally tell the difference in a blind test."
417768,"can you please make the video a little more darker, it's too bright"

417848,"well, illidan had to wait 10k, i'd say we're doing pretty well"
417893,"it's a shooter with the same amount of people on teams that isn't a twitch shooter like cod, they're the same."
417928,"i should be global, shit tier teammates keeping me down!"
417931,any fluidity they might add to brands kit will end up evaporating anyway.
417967,but your chauffeur is still shrinked
417978,great shitpost where no-one has no idea what you're trying to show us
417986,yeah a point and click silence being taken away is completely unjustified
417993,"as a german, i feel kinda offended"
418000,never knew their was a victorious nidalee skin
418044,i dont want them to find my hacks

418100,"but i'm just a dirty tsm fan, clearly i know nothing."
418127,"well yeah, but nudity is *waaay* more scarring than brutal murder."
418249,clearly she's just using strategic posing and is being photoshopped as well.
418264,"what are you on about, every time an lcs team is interviewed they talk about how their goal is worlds."
418271,i think 50% of teams would win every day
418290,good to see the graphics have held up since e3
418322,you need to have money in the bank to be able to buy things with your debit card.
418340,if they did pan1c_ wouldn't get them anyway
418345,hey if you fight him early before he gets all his abilities and cdr you have at least 4 seconds
418370,well if he is so desperatly in need to increase the size of his internet donger to make a his daughter sit infront of his pc and play cs i think its deserved?
418408,surely the ability to 420 no-scope scrubs is more satisfying
418457,the human eye can only see 30fps so of course light travels slow by logic duh
418463,"zyra is fine, no one plays her anyways"
418476,wow how dare you insult the greatest adc in the west

418563,"when it's released, fire emblem fans and final fantsays fans alike are enraged to find out if has been rebranded as *fe and is essentially final fantasy 13 with fire emblem characters as summons."
418611,the escapist has other content?
418636,"yeah, im sure they allocate the programmers and stuff to make skins"
418701,just drop it somewhere around the mediterranean sea with a sign that reads refugee and it'll end up in germany sooner or later.

418783,shroud is going to carry them to top 3 major kinda
418786,"its not like people on tl have each other's backs or anything, s1mple is just following their example"

418807,"referencing the game, smite, in a very clever way"
418808,this hasn't been brought up before.
418874,"yes, but varying parameters for the queue would cause you to only be able to choose marksmen in champ select as a result, and also enable multiple people to pick the same champ (again)."
418891,"so they will go ahead with the manamune change huh... well who cares, we already have so many items with impactful actives anyway"
418901,"and they can, gotta get them 1080's down pat."
418959,"i was going to link an eve video, then i realized"

419108,"hey, i don't want a replay because thta would mean i have to socially interact as a human being!"
419109,there is nothing like celebrating the ressurection of jesus christ with a nice poro rider sejuani skin purchase.
419121,"*watch out*, you're going to ruin the industry"
419130,can't you see this theory is legit?
419156,cause there no such thing as a corrupt republican.
419160,this can't be true because all dlc was carved out of the base game to squeeze more money from gamers.
419184,yeah he should continue talking about the game instead of just ending the interview there!
419185,this totally isn't gonna fizzle and fade into the shadows like every other kickstarter shooter game.
419307,none of tl will be getting any prize money
419312,"full ad lee can kill people just as fast, i think they should nerf his mobility and ofc nerf his r cooldown by a lot"

419365,na'vi would of won when it was a best of five offcourse
419371,yes because professional teams have never held a press conference to explain decisions before.
419441,"it looks fine in the thumbnail, why not watch there"
419446,yes my vocabulary is defined by the usage of a single word.
419450,halo: reach was never released for xbox one 0/10
419451,still better graphics than fallout 4
419478,yeah i'm pretty sure userbase don't mean shit
419485,it's this kinda of circlejerky reaction that makes me wonder why cs:go isn't more appealing to the masses
419494,downvoting you because you don't like the fallout community which means your a fallout hater
419496,"but, pbe is the place for free skins, i shouldn't have to deal with new buggy or op stuff just to enjoy the new skin for free."
419500,that's what americans have been telling the world for years!
419510,because players are entitled to everything for free.
419541,"yeah, i mean i wish sony would through a bone to their loyal xbox customers."
419637,they will surely remove it because it isn't successfull at all
419647,but brooo their statues are the best!
419650,"wow, those refugees are fast, went from 8m to 8.5m in a mere hour!"
419666,i think he meant nerf needs to implement a new gun called the deagle
419682,"wow you preordered, don't you know preordering is literally worse than satan and that you are killing gaming by preordering?"
419686,zombiiu is a perfect match for littluns!
419688,i think you should put the monitor and the cpu closer to each other.
419740,i don't think you should be using a laptop while driving.
419797,"but as a community, we have learn to accept and love bethesda's bugs, glitches, and vintage graphics as fun and quirky features."
419802,but u has skinz so no hacker report
419863,as long as i win lane its all my teams fault
419864,but reddit is always right about a game being dead!
419880,sounds like you're having fun with your life...
419912,it's going to be a duo release with the new tentacle porn champ
419929,"that's not a kick bot, it's just a crazy skilled player playing on a 0ms connection, cdew got out-skilled hard yo!"
420014,"pants confirmed for skype group, no wonder your tier lists hit the front page so often!"

420343,it reminded me of your casting.
420375,seems a lot went with the low int build
420386,"we already have a pug champion team, they go by the name clg"
420387,the difference is that non-league of legends chat is highbrow and respectable.
420413,your champion being dead is a form of hard cc
420415,nah i'm sure that lee sin sees your top lane opponent over extending with no wards placed/under his tower with less than 300 hp... but farming to scale up into the game is much more important business!
420454,but calling them casuals will make us feel superior!
420489,you might see it in legion [as there is speculation she will control the underworld as models have been found of her in there]
420490,introducing fable feq's and drip fed content that should have been there at launch.
420496,"nah, it's easier to bitch about queue times."

421722,"wow you're right, i forgot the game was released march 2013."
421972,"when fnatic loses, it's because they were tired, when tsm loses, it's because they fucking suck and everyone who likes them is a delusional fanboy"
422451,you guys are hilariously original!
422551,"because clearly, that's the only thing releasing on ps4 and xb1"
422665,"hopefully, we can drive the other titan in the most epic vehicle fight ever."
422688,that little girl is way too young to be playing witcher 3 what horrible parents
422689,don't forget gta v and the witcher 3
422847,because you rush a defensive item on an adc right?
422967,let's bitch about ahri's 3 dashes on an ult cooldown though.
423035,if you were any more oblivious i would say you were jaune.
423132,"yeah and once tanks don't just counter assassins, buff adcs so assassins don't just counter them."
423261,because hotshot would rather keep huhi he performs amazing in scrims
423262,no he is a high risk high reward champion that takes great skill and you have to me good to get fed with.
423328,"hey, that doesn't sound like anything."
423386,"wow great, i totally don't even need solo queue anymore"
423432,2 toddlers in a bath full of water preoccupied adult playing gow what could go wrong!

424977,just buy rapid firecannon for that sweet jump range increase
425008,"honestly i like dynamic queue, queueing up with 4 friends and stomping some poor guys feels great"
425024,"yeah, for sure is a supereasy to fix bug and riot is only being lazy and they don't want to listen because they are busy counting all that mad skrilla."
425025,maybe that's why development is taking so long.
425061,but... i thought riot is bad and doesn't listen to players!
425091,| nothing can replace happy's baiting ftfy
425123,while they are at it they should nerf the first bullet accuracy of all the rifles to make spray and pray more viable at long range.

425905,you really think someone would just come on reddit and use memes like that?
425918,never tigers are still same team that lost to we in katowice.
425931,we should stop coddling those tennis and golf players and start yelling during their matches
425996,"[he went out there to buy time, otherwise a bunch of them would have made it past the chokepoint, or possibly been able to disrupt the spell and overrun the frostwolves entirely]"
426004,because roccat yellowstar forg1ven
426027,yeah because you've experienced it so you know

426461,they don't reveal how it works to prevent toxicity.
426493,"meh, community is big enough that a clamor can be stirred up and possibly result in a ban."
426498,glad to see after so many years cod hasn't changed at all
426584,that's just desperate na-cs/other fanbois trying to keep the hope alive by idolizing the ibp-players they would have become the best team in the world obviously
426605,is this a worrying trend for clg?
426633,yeah way too much competitive junglers in na
426698,it's almost like they don't think about every aspect of a change before they do it

427001,maybe that was the small update
427013,what do you need a second floor for we have plenty of content already
427016,i bet you anything you'd use the game pad as a camera.
427041,but aren't you upset that they aren't focusing on online gaming and are having you interact with physical media?
427080,nonono it doesnt matter if there is a mute button we have to fuck it up for everyone because a small amount of people cry about meanies but dont want to mute them.
427105,unless of course you have dual towers and both are sporting 4 titan x's each...
427219,good thing they thought to bring sniper teams.
427233,so happy to see women showing us how much they hate being objectified in video games!

427632,"they stated already he will be up on 6.3 as to receive buffs, because they probably will look deeply into it realizing he is waaay less tanky than they wanted him to be during oneshotting everyone left and right."

429328,"yeah definitely, those guys represent the millions of cod players."

429641,"i follow lpl, cause i read twitter"
429657,yes as you can see this isn't in korea and the o in apdo has a little apostrophe on it so we know this can't be apdo
429705,dw nightblue3 and gosu are available i believe
429710,"no, because we don't have a champ on a skateboard and they do."
429717,hey now we're talking about fnatic now not c9 ;)
429731,yeah 8% dmg reduction as well as keeping your laner alive is so dumb on tank junglers lol who would get that it doesn't give you ad

429849,"damn, hope you don't get downvoted too hard for all that truth..."

429886,mic on doesn't mean he will talk
429887,well i suppose i wouldn't put it past blizzard to make it so boots are only obtained by fishing
429892,glad you know shroud well enough to read into his underlying motives so well
429958,"hey now, the earth is 3, maybe 4 thousand years old in this game.that could have literally been the start of that waterfall."
429983,"yes they rekt esl cuz they gave one semifinalist ( the winner of quarterfinal ) less time to prepare for the semifinal and the semifinalist 2 will only know their opponent 3 hours before the match ... talking about fair play, yeah good job mlg"
430539,"let's give him more publicity, that'll definitely help."
431290,riot confirmed bias to european players rito pls we get nothing 111
431429,apparently since i don't have the all knowing answers to cloud 9's many issues it means that i'm wrong and my argument doesn't make any sense.
431520,yeah those toxic *** make me cringe.
431557,but then what would be the purpose of negev and m249?
431630,finally my gut knife boreal will get me a dlore

432451,technically blast processing didn't become a thing until sanic 2
432500,lan/las/oce are huge dude we need to wait even more
432740,surely you meant when kio would bait for happy
432911,delete this post fast before you spoil na'vi tactics
432997,but what about 128 tick and better ac?
433035,"no fix for rengar's bola, keep it up riot!"
433073,because he's not played so much anymore i remember the time when he was played in competitive and he'd just oneshot people straight from 100-0 good champ imo.
433118,"its always mojangs fault, they are responsible for everything bad in this world just because we have to save our transaction ids to proof we own something"
433204,"yea man, that .2 more ap is gonna make him spike sooo much harder"
433220,"i'm not sure actually, i don't play top and anytime there is a darius in the game i avoid him because, for some reason a tank can out duel a melee assassin."
433237,"yeah coz the alliance never does anything wrong, we are just perfect in every way"
433294,"only for health pools, damage is back to the much more reasonable hundreds of thousands"
433380,something... functional strength.
433401,thorin just trying to trigger brazilians and get death threats
433498,if it's not moving it's not alive
433525,the only way somone could ever possibly kill me is if they cheated.
433681,zed sure lacks outplay potential atm.
433787,yeah because if you are bad you shouldn't have the right to enjoy having nice skins nor enjoy the game
433804,"well i mean it isn't just another clip from qtpie's stream, so obviously report it."
433833,"spoilet tag this shit, i have been avoiding spoilers for over a month!"

434084,that's what mlg gets for playing metal during downtime
434134,50% of those viewers are people idling on their alt
434167,but i thought he got along with everyone?
434306,"yea man, but their voices are totally different"
434358,but i heard microsoft hires lazy people because they find an easier way to do the job!
434359,"i don't know, didn't lyte tell us only a tiny fraction of the community is actually toxic just last year?"
434438,good thing it's only $40 then...
434456,we should tell blizz to remove the skin
434476,"doesn't seem that complicated, you should do it op"
434482,"because being gay is a disease, it's a known fact!"
434499,american citizenship best ship.
434566,tl;dr old people are stuck up and stubborn
434654,"yeah, they practically hand out limited availability skins when you buy him"
434674,and when has nationalism ever been a bad thing.
434690,"yeah, too many players already."
434699,yeah but he could have avoided this by buying an sg.
434847,i'll tell you when you're older.
434907,yeah man rogue is so fun and engaging in the alpha
434927,"fame, like youth and beauty, is eternal"
434948,wow 40 points and 6 comments she must be in a skypegroup or something
435005,"yeah, cos publishers always give you the exact roadmap for dlc along with release dates at the same time as the game releases, so you can write all of that info down in your little dlc notepad."
435089,apparently people don't understand sarcasm when you don't use the
435194,"think one is only referencing worlds s4, dade went out in semi's and therefore is overhyped and bad"
435201,"i know it doesn't make any sense fighting a healthy kid is stupid, wouldn't easier to just beat up an injured kid."
435209,the game mode has only been out for a while.. people don't notice those things for at least a year.
435210,"clg draft is soo good, they can make a protect the adc comp and a hard engage comp in just one game!"
435214,"because fuck support and whatever other lanes, tristana was the only carry."
435254,just pink her passive pre-6 man
435275,why would an na team need a tactical mind?
435319,"yeah, those optional dance moves and emotes that babe absolutely zero effect on gameplay sure did ruin the experience!"
435324,ya that guy that owns echo fox is like a noob to stuff like this
435325,ya but every1 knos he assault the player backstag no1 like him complimentary

435387,"well the technology just isn't there yet, its not like other modern multiplayer games have voice chat right?"
435394,for the people who can't tell this is obvious sarcasm...
435460,because let's be honest having booth with transparent glass is clearly going to solve that problem.
435534,yeah fuck them for doing what they want with their stories!
435623,all the great times i had and friends made because of voice chat.
435624,we all know how good vac is at catching cheaters
435636,another example of the mods being blizzard shills.
435651,nintendo doesnt know what marketing is
435713,"nope, you're the only one in the world"
435740,still hoping for the wolf reveal in smash bros at this e3 presentation
435783,yes i shall embrace my unwavering heterosexuality after watching this
435785,yeah because all game devs are elite professional gamers
435809,he's so important that once he left the game everyone left with him.
435829,"agreed , this vid shows how much better this guy is then kennys at his best"
435850,but clg didnt deserve their invite to dreammhack
435955,"but goldenglue is higher in soloq than some of these imports, clearly ember should pay him just as much as bjergsen"
435984,that's cultural appropriation m8
436024,"this is fake, i can tell by the pixels and having seen quite a few pentas in my days"
436098,"i would readd deathfire grasp, some guys know it as dfg :) thats just my 2 cents"
436107,"yes, because sarcasm is sooo easy to detect in text."
436132,"sure, its been ages since his release but only now have people discovered how broken he is clearly"
436144,then all of na cs would be banned euro master race
436191,it was a whole fucking second of no counterplay
436323,steel got a perm ban why not ppl in matchmaking?
436360,"mufffinz u hacken man, you can't possibly know where i'm supposed to be on my common one way smokes because they're on way man"
436381,going to be so much fun for the enemy team as well.
436405,"because swain and malz were too op, she needed compensation buffs"
436442,"leblanc looks pretty weak, better buff her."
436480,its a shame the ct bomb still has the same sound effects
436504,yea because no one would abuse vote to kick.
436676,"yeah, because boosting and duoing with smurfs hasn't happened at all in the past five years."
436689,coz tsm is best team and will win worlds with this line up
436772,"we almost went 0-2, that's enough to determine their entire season."
436774,"you shared your account with a hacker, so it must be banned"
436804,"but it was in older wow, which means it must be good, right?"
436805,"my mistake, i thought jokes have to be funny ..."
436844,because there are no trolls after that
436848,what he meant was 15k ukrainian hryvnia.
436899,no that would be unfair and make ranks lack value
436919,obviously they really like the format and hate bo5 since there is no reason why they don't go with bo5.
436963,the pyramids because i want everyone to know i'm a dank memer and those are obviously illuminati
436976,a map coin that's grown too much?
437013,[with the next xpacs faction leaders i could really see those good/neutral terms going to shit as soon as we show up]
437018,"send me the code, i'll see if i can redeem it."
437042,"his damage is getting nerfed, his w got nerfed idk what more you want"
437097,good thing we are getting some xp boosts to compensate for this
437098,"no, i did it twice and got swatted last summer."
437101,she's indeed really fun to play against
437140,i think (and hope) you forgot your
437158,richard lewis might be able to choke it
437257,but we did not have a conan universe survival game that must be a whole different ball game man.
437266,"yeah, he probably only uses it to advertise it and he doesn't want to learn from his mistakes."
437343,m8 he was more obvious then flusha
437344,how dare you doubt the power of the xbox one!
437386,that's a kelp splat charger you uncultured swine
437393,not to mention very fun to play against
437403,does your game run at 60fps/1080p?
437404,my name is ocean they call me odeag i shit on scrubs in the esl pro league
437431,"no skill toxic champion, amirite?"
437437,why would they care for what was supposed to be a visual update
437491,"doesn't matter, csgo is cpu game"
437494,yes cheating is completely allowed.
437534,yeah i didnt get that from the replies hes already sent me
437557,you need to understand rendering a completely gray screen takes lots of energy
437601,"hey man, everyone has the best ideas and everyone else needs to know about them."
437616,"armor of the 5th age is fabulous enough, thank you."
437650,yeah if only the eu players actually wanted to play in eu...
437692,just buy a nashors tooth on her
437754,"too bad that they don't follow them up, like they did with the integrity and fairplay."
437806,lol because you're clearly so intelligent about the matter
437822,obviously because nobody wants to watch that much na games
437844,"i'm sure it's just you they hate, the rest of us all feel loved by blizzard as we sit here in our salt mines of onlywatch, waiting for beta waves."
437869,so wrong dude... score defines everything
437878,so we're back to all of them?
437887,yes because some nobody like you obviously knows how riot should run their company.. you know so much more about running a moba than everyone at riot combined.
437899,"yes, making public how often xbox live is attacked is such a great idea."
437901,typical noob being like 'everyone who's better than me is cheating'
437935,since when has giving a champion true damage from a passive ever backfired before?
437953,sharing* the amount of times i've watched this to the very end..
437956,144hz monitor makes you global in no time
437974,he probably made the map in 128 ticks
437982,"yea man, i guess medium graphics makes the game literally unplayable!"
438017,but they're fun because they are legendaries right?
438022,ryan did it because hes a big meany bully
438075,"yeah because the entire concept of movement as something you can learn to increase your skill level shouldn't be rewarded, you right."
438150,i'm sure steel will then pull the discrimination card since he's jewish
438215,but im already queuing solo...
438248,"the bug has been around for a while it is something about true damage or some shit, hopefully they fix it."
438267,"in the current state, $100 is a lot."
438330,at least we have an invite level pro here to set it straight.
438341,whats renegades got to do with it?
438370,"you're right, he didn't do anything in ot just now."
438402,right and we all know xpeke isn't as great as nudeduck because nukeduck is playing in lcs and at 1st place while xpeke is only a sub for a mid tier eu team.
438423,"yeah... black ops 3 is the pinnacle of gaming, you just wouldn't understand that it's impossible to implement an aim bot into a console game."
438435,stat trak pins confirmed counting the number of time you rearrange!
438449,there was this surprising lack of gragas from the semi finals on..
438498,i would like the ability to see flusha's hacks too
438599,ya according to anyone playing a blizzard game they do nothing right.
438621,but it boosts your immune system!
438634,i am so triggered that you'd sexualize him like that.
438646,the shitty ass car deformation sure added to the gameplay too
438697,with that size... the game sure has a lot of content.
438712,because video games are all about being realistic
438723,and this comment is sooo original!
438727,where's the oddshot conversion bot when you need one
438729,"but guys, steam machines outperform consoles at the same price point"
438765,"yes, please remove the most significant stuff; umbra crescent and armor; about watchers."
438815,or everyone's wishes and dreams will be fulfilled and there will be no need to throwdown.
438823,"yeah, but you see, only one of those is made by those evil sjws and the other one might hinder my enjoyment of a thing!"
438836,i returned my copy after seeing this post.
438839,"hi stupid, i'm glad you get it now."
438875,"yeah its so easy to protect from ddos, thats why no-one gets ddossed anymore"
438881,ghost wolf + unleash flame and run away
438887,or tada a blizz sponsored mod just fixes the title for you!
438890,"ok, we may need a riot forgot mega thread soon"
438907,yea they sure showed inconsistency at this recent major going as far as they did.
438950,double 1tap down mid yea that's ez bro
438961,apparently c9 never practices and pugs are the only time shroud plays cs.
438975,or because all the pros do it and it is obviously the thing that is making them better.
438979,maybe even breeding them with iron ingots?
439034,your username makes me think this is
439043,fallout 4 looks way better than this
439057,ddosed himself so he can take a break from carrying
439061,"thank god we'll have dynamic queues next season, so rankeds will be taken more seriously :d"
439088,i think you should only get it if you were also a day one-er
439121,lucky na was so much entertainment last season
439123,the moment gamers accidentally clicked on reddit instead of blackboard.
439160,"you know, i always thought the q cost was just outrageously high"
439205,yeah right because fnc was bad.
439220,so he is first going to watch the prequels and later play the game?
439246,"but baron's fountain is the pit, that's where he regens hp!"
439292,"but the ui is completely different, that makes for a whole different game!"
439315,"yeah, forum outcries have totally ruined all blizzard games."
439355,seangares to complexity confirmed
439383,pushing someone away when they go nose-to-nose i would declare as defending myself and that might very well happen in the upper chest/neck-area ___ but maybe that's just me as a professional hooligan and violent person in general
439398,"dude hauntzer is a fucking beast, he totally dominated both acorn and flame, some of the best top laners in the world, now i understand why dyrus wanted him."
439467,"i mean, how dare you steal from those raiders, they worked really hard to get that stuff."
439468,are you talking about the bomb timer?
439475,"$38 for project spark, now that's the australia tax"
439493,"just like last season, when they got those four rookies there will be no way they can win eu lcs again"
439876,"right, demonstrations should not be indicative of the real thing."
440222,"it was jungler fault, he should be in front of you"
441003,"that wouldn't happen, because nobody would want to play tranzit."
441289,this devalues my stattrak elite build guns.
441435,wait... arbok doesn't spell snake backwards!
441801,"yea, you look like nice and chill person seeing this thread and your posts in it."
441808,"damn, unlucky for poe that he is still stricken by illness"
441809,yeah h2k should just not ward the back of the baron pit
442046,so he used the dance pad to type in his credit card info?
442196,"til my cat, chair and potato all ping riot just as well as my pc..."
442372,yea so broken that everyone builds it every game.
442374,"yea if doublelift blamed one person for all of the teams problems, and apologized to all the former team mates, everyone would suck his dick!"
442448,yeah would suck if we got fun things in the game
442481,"makes it so people don't look around, and accidentally buy for a teammate who already got a gun dropped, but was too far away to pick it up"
442865,"yeah, the shit ton of people that mute nalcs due to shitty casters don't exist at all."
443017,"man, but you play great in tsm's games."
443054,you don't get money from it so it isn't real!
443083,"there's always going to be at least one comment like this in a thread like this... yeah dude, the solution to this guy not being able to play xbox for 12 hours straight is definitely to just divorce the wife and make her a single mom."
443097,but she has to flash ult you to stun you!
443175,inb4 they change the map into a big square so you don't even have to move anymore cause that required skill
443176,revolvo never would do anything stupid
443214,"well, its easy, just focus her, their hypercarry/ies won't kill you while you focus a support first"
443227,"you're right, shit play by him, not even sure why he posted this garbage"
443319,the baseball game we all have been clamouring for...right guys?
443322,i'm sure it will be so much better and different than the last ten cod's.
443329,because if i don't like something then no one is allowed to have it!
443371,"dynamic que is always solo when you have no friends :d sure you might have to play with a premade of 4 that circlejerks against you, but toxicity is what makes this game great"
443384,"yes... excuse me for having more sensitive eyes then you, i should be ashamed"
443478,eu players obviously have better vision
443485,petition to ban guns in fps games because it promotes violence plz
443492,damn i guess i am not a grill then
443494,"envyus will become magic, go back into the competition and win"
443495,how about they give us everything for free!
443508,well thank you... that completely mixed range of opinions really helps to settle anything...
443523,yeah must've been a trigger or smth

443661,i'm sure all of you would do much better.
443687,so talented that they're sitting in the stands
443706,typical male talking like we can just switch off gender issues when it's not convenient
443753,well if u dont wanna be as bad as get right who is using the g303 u shouldnt
443757,gotta check vents by jumping and trying to noscope!
443810,c9 also beat fnatic so shouldnt they be ?
443885,"hate to say it, but your ps4's days are numbered..."
443922,"still wouldve made the same money, m0e stickers op"
443968,they are trying to make karthus more shitty so when they update his splash later nobody will complain
444031,"it was a joke bro, do i really have to put"
444084,"how to play him in 2 minutes: you try, you die and change to another hero after 2 minutes."
444090,yea social interaction is scary
444179,omg evil sjws ruin everything amirite
444215,but the fallout 4 graphics suck.. am i rite?
444280,because early game has no significance on the rest of the game.
444323,"and the script, don't forget lcs is scripted."
444354,gears of war was the original game
444367,sven is rly fed after yesterday.
444372,maybe we can get trump and riot together for a corki drone bomb!
444378,just think of all the micro transactions!
444450,im idling for a stattrack karambit slaughter.
444465,"clearly riot have to give you 1000 rp for each game, otherwise they are just luring you into their evil gambling scheme"
444647,i hope everyone getting into the beta weekend will make a thread about it.
444677,maikelele elegiggle was elegiggle the elegiggle problem elegiggle
444685,"number 5 reporting in, that's almost a full team"
444686,"turns out when you play characters designed to kill, you kill, who knew"
444705,"no, faker is the tyler1 of mid lane, when tyler doesn't feel like playing mid draven."
444792,what are you talking about valve still makes video games they just made the lab!
444813,its cause he wins 100% of his games so he has more ip
444828,"most are, yeah, but there a few diamond scrubs out there don't know why tho, with dynamic queue literally anyone can get challenger"
444860,"yea, hell why even teach history in schools no one needs that old history lesson to see how we have gotten to where we are today"
444888,i mean if you don't buy a whole new account to raf with or drag a friend into it and spend gold on xp pots you are clearly lazy and you shouldn't complain that leveling through tbc and wrath is a painful and boring process.
444908,i think it will something along the line of a paladin will visit [tirion's grave and return the ashbringer to pay tribute to the fallen hero.]
444933,but sub numbers don't show if a game is healthily growing
444963,guess i play with my gold friends in my master promos
445063,but didn't you hear we can only see in 24fps ... or some shit like that
445066,wow a slow thats gonna save you against a zed thats ulting you
445074,"i wonder what armor is doing there, it's not even necessary to play as a mage!"
445149,"ikr, europe was really hyped last year"
445164,riot's never wrong about their way of doing things
445172,"she reminds me of javert from les mis but much more stubborn and even more driven to put her opposite back behind bars, [to the point where she's willing to sacrifice her friends, allies, and army she's rallied just to attempt to take out illidan]"
445178,an entire team of diamond players won worlds at one point.
445232,but i see one every time i play gran turismo.
445250,op divorced in 2007 didnt you click the link?
445297,told i shouldn't talk and that i'm trash after smashing a kid 14/3
445322,"no, febiven is a god because he killed faker with a hard counter"
445347,but atleast we had a nice aphro interview afterwards
445364,yes because you cant play a game and constantly complain about said game.
445368,you must be playing fake games then.
445369,that definitely didn't end up with a phone call to the police!
445446,"well, it is azir and rengar, two of the least bugged champs."
445476,"what a guy, really speaking up for the plebs with a super unpopular opinion"
445496,i for one am excited about all the new amiibos they're going to announce!
445527,i've probably seen more nude body parts of lea than i saw my dad.
445551,it must be a problem with your hard drive
445611,"well, i say it's worth it since it blocks minors from content they're too young to see."
445655,"wow, because thorin is never wrong!"
445682,"yep, he got humiliated by no names cs players like poe and febiven in eu..."
445713,eco ace must be so amazing to be upvoted so much
445741,polygon had it right: _her story_ is the real goty.
445759,yeah but it's not clear in a teamfight
445776,what do you expect from a game where every round is the exact same scenario?
445801,"but ea has given people bad video game endings or charged people for dlc, would could possibly be worse than that?"
445829,"apparently we haven't had enough mini-games already, seing all the **positive** feedback for champions that redefine the game... *cough*"
445878,nip's line should sky rocket now that they have a new line up...
445985,yeah but there's no wallhack so the game is unbalanced
446000,hundreds are watching your every mistake
446067,but how can other cultures be different to the vastly superior one of the us?
446120,"these bugs are in the game for ages, a ton of other minor bugs get attention while these barely gets any... --- at least they made yi's /dance scale with movement speed!"
446169,it will track the amount of reloads
446210,not like malware or trojans can run automatically
446211,"whoa, come on, isis aren't *that* bad!"
446219,"yeah wtf mata is so biased... na got loads of talent too like bjergsen, huni, reignover, yellowstar, froggen, alex ich, impact, piglet, rush, fenix, gbm!"

446265,what we really need is particle effects!
446302,you have to pay a subscription to golf?
446324,why not just get the challengers of reddit to compete
446337,"im pretty sure he didnt hear him or anything, he mustve just used an aimbot..."
446344,"it might be an update for a map from the workshop... just a gut feeling, i have 0 evidence for it"
446401,yeah the game is rigged so there is more excitement from an eu vs brazilian team so it isn't a complete stomp
446459,"that's hardline, it's stupid no matter what, get with the program."
446480,"holy shit, i really hope you just forgot a"
446520,"yeah, but dynamic queue is the better experience"
446557,"thanks for nerfing the only defense we have against rengar, as small as it may be!"
446582,that's what you deserve for losing that 1 match
446602,"no you're right, it'd only be fair at that point and then it's just stupid."
446687,he's gotta make a living somhow.
446696,well i asked what he meant didn't i
446807,wow.. so much for a one time payment
446824,"they like money, what if we bait them with reddit gold for every reply, huh?"
446902,"guys i got 15 entry kills that game, that's more than olofmeister gets sometimes i must be pro!"
446993,"nah man, just stop being such a pussy and stop being depressed, it's that simple!"
446994,oh shit man you hold all the secrets do an ama you sound totally important...
447042,actually the game starts at 00:15
447065,now if we could just make one that takes place in a school
447083,you better edit your flair after that.
447270,"what, your don't want to but a thene for $2.99?"
447311,your first mistake was playing dominion
447344,they were probably too much effort for the low price they were selling for
447400,he also paid rekkles and febi to say in every interview how hard its to take his role as shot caller.
447429,woah guys dont jump the gun on them fiora nerfs that whole one sec is a bit much
447487,but that's where everyone takes the game seriously!

447711,"they can only write so fast, it's not like they are copying arma mods or anything"
447760,"this community is founded on the basis of circle jerks, memes, miss information and unreasonable hate agains na you can't just come in and be reasonable."
447767,i'm sick of seeing these pc vs console screen shots!
447780,point taken... sometimes i just feel the need to be ultra defensive and make an ass of myself
447788,"because valve = good, ubisoft = bad."
447967,it looked like all the terrorists were playing on xbox to me... (i don't say that k word so)
447973,"yeah, the millions in sales for fo4 is really making them think long and hard on where to take their series next"
448017,nooo nobody bothered to make 1000 of those since launch nope
448101,welshes are cold-blooded killers.
448132,because obviously the na teams are in cahoots with the government.
448135,cause i'd rather watch lux perma ulting waves from base and raka perma healing to victory
448163,"all dlc should be in the base game no exceptions, unless it's the witcher 3"
448164,"i was dmg before patch and im dmg now, what does that say about me?"
448193,that's because poland needs some good cs players and they know it
448213,bengi and marin clearly trolled the early game both second and third game.
448217,yeah fuck that guy for wanting to do his own thing and not doing what his parents tell him to do
448232,"yeah, giving her attack speed in her passive is definitely a nerf."
448305,"seeing as though they won worlds this year, we wont be seeing them for worlds 2016!"
448352,i think it's better to rent a stream of last-gen games i already own...
448379,"wait, where was amazing...oh, of course."
448413,these jumping knives gotta be nerfed
448451,peel back that white tape for me?
448477,i trust a random guy on the internet more than a company that relies on good publicity for sales
448480,how much would you charge for this hero?
448489,"my guess its not finished yet and they want to hold off on showing it, because you know wow's fan base never overreacts to anything"
448491,you can still buy an account on ebay for only 700$ !
448492,"that is impressive, but it's not something i recognize so it's wrong!"
448507,"no, you see, clearly the question was written in invisible ink!"
448516,how dare they joke about performance enhancing drugs
448553,grinding hot masteries in a zerg group is so social
448560,not like they already have access to your computer at all since you have steam installed...
448565,"yep this is a real drastic change, couldnt they have just tried a couple nerfs and buffs when the game was in close beta?"
448569,"i hear there is a jungle main ruining soloq, his name is hotguy6pack"
448610,"you got them, you just can't see them."
448627,bug - check wonky animation - check it's probably fallout 4
448640,no sense arguing when riven has an 85% win rate and 100% pick/ban in the world's tournament that just concluded.
448641,"ah yes, because of rune of power and jet stream is the pinnacle of fun!"
448676,"but guys, removing the boring talent trees took out cookie -cutter specs!"
448686,indeed redefined... is this based on the new hitman movie?
448704,"fake, yak-9 didn't fire a railgun through your cockpit."
448707,*checks insulters flair* im down to come rek u with berettas if u want
448760,and i love drinking orange juice after brushing my teeth!
448761,"you mean devs can't make new content with the flick of a switch, and don't need money to continue making games?"
448762,but bunny plays duo with hai so it is basicly confirmed
448847,"watch out, that kind of attitude is how big gaming gets you."
448854,new generation to lazy even to play games... kids these days
448876,"well you know man he was like a month away from being 18, if this would of just been a month later he never would of threw because he would of known better"
448902,can't have fun when talking about anything destiny.
448904,"exactly, they used the keyboard and mouse in real life too like every terrorist does."
448911,"no, the semis should be 10v10 with both teams on the winning side advancing to the final."
448912,yeah so much fun hearing ontowards him every 3 sentences.
448936,just like polish crowd were cheering for nip in esm katowice 2014 finals.
448945,"didn't pulverize and then flash, shitty ass play, downvoted."
448950,"it's a waste, you can only see 30 fps, 15 fps each eye."
448961,source 2 will fix this for sure
448980,better hire thousands of peoples to reply to every single support ticket one by one right ?
448986,poppy has a low cd max health damage scaling on ap while building ad fucking broken
448997,i'm sure a dmg can teach everyone how to get better at headshots.
449037,my uncle who works at nintendo says they will
449043,"right, those fuckers need to go through the work of stealing a country from the natives"
449057,but i don't want to react to the game at but also i want to win every game can you just please nerf everyone except my favorite champ to make this easier on me?
449068,why didn't fnatic just let vuggo play at the end?
449082,many eu players are jealous of the higher skill level in na which results in banter like this.
449123,but there is no sex appeal in dota
449144,"i don't even play yi, i just have this flair cause i'm too lazy to change it."
449739,"yeah, let's screw over splitpushers again because that was so fun the last time we did it"
450093,"yeah, there are so many male protagonists that doesn't apply to at all."
450188,this wouldn't have happened if they all had guns.
450595,i could be challenger if my teammates werent holding me back
450694,dude viktor was broken unlike rageblade
450960,"you can't, you basicly 1v5 or lose, when you pick fiora you need to carry your team because thats why you picked her"
451009,would be nice for terrorists to communicate
451010,but not as forced as anders casting
451527,ask me for my stream so i can post it here
451737,"well it's obvious, you didn't turn your hacks off before recording we can see his outline"
451746,i didn't know tom hanks liked warhammer
451889,i've always wanted to spend almost 2 hours watching teams play only to end the same way it started
451982,throwbinds deserves vac and 25 to life
452027,looks like faceit 128 tik.. so ez shot
452113,what you don't like the new s76 akin with a biker helmet on?
452149,i still think it's nice they added zeratul to the sc games after his debut in heroes of the storm
452218,"wait, you didnt accept exposure as an adequate form of compensation?"
452381,"he's 100% serial, i can tell by the lack of"
452396,"and all of a sudden, queue times increased by 10 minutes worldwide."
452678,still better than virtus.premier
452715,wow i played with that guy too what a coincidence :ooo
452743,til that sonic the hedgehog is an oversexualised female character.
452774,"yes, because clearly the majority of people play in dia+."
452856,"no, i think it's a different engine."
452870,"you mean like the oculus-exclusive lucky's tale, which was give a glorious 5/10 by gamespot?"
452888,"game is totally different now, crosshair placement is irrelevant in the new meta"
452895,"hey, at least zombie was a aaa game just a few years ago"
452929,"maybe they should move him to the coach position after this major, seems like he would do better there"
452949,"ye its so easy to get ahead of quinn,graves, naut or any s tier tank as olaf"
452970,pushing him down a set of stairs would be a good way of disabling him
453040,"gj, you not only came of as a passive aggressive douche, you also managed to act conceited and childish at the same time, quite the accomplishment"
453162,"no, it's totally not unethical to accept gifts before reviewing products."
453203,"736 ilvl is pathetic, i don't blame them"
453261,he is faster than her and has iceborne.
453348,"but aoe kayle ult is op, i don't care about it's cooldown, radius, duration, mana cost, range and the delay!"
453415,enchantment shaman sounds interesting.
453511,she's a bad support because she's meant to be a burst mage with lich bane.
453574,but if you're an asshole to someone you think is an asshole too it's justified
453645,"since tanks were complete trash before the juggernaut patch, right?"
453660,"how could it be vac secured, he is clearly cheating"
453759,maybe nintendo will learn from how many they're making and will start making more than 6 of each amiibo.
453790,"yeah, because everyone is going to pax east"
453907,stop being so sexist if she was a guy you wouldn't be saying that
453956,bdd showing he can solokill faker 4 times in a game!
454011,god forbid they implement something like a spinning wheel like every other video game has on loading screens to let us know the game isn't frozen.
454044,in true riot fashion you'll get chat restricted and banned for 1 week.
454076,it's so broken nami should be disabled
454102,"quality post man, a lot of effort you put into it i can see."
454110,but its your fault for taking 1 step away from your tower
454185,damn quite expensive no wonder dreamhack 'fixed' the semis for nip
454222,with your complementary metric system
454263,no queue like for lfr because nobody is going to run a raid after two years
454297,because inferno is just that balanced
454305,no dude it's getting fucked so brutishly that i'm gonna feel it for years.
454348,out of range you mean leave the map right.
454358,yeah i'm not giving up years of unperfected bhops either
454375,"i'm going to make it out one day, but 100% of my teammates are bronze... so they're holding me back"
454388,yeah cause what this game needs is rng in the neutral objectives...
454412,itt: liquid pays s1mple to boost them to a legendary spot in the major
454449,yea that ratchet and clank one was sooo bad!
454491,but that's not what us .3 delta version ex cal-o pros use.
454506,because he keeps finding out his teams are a bunch of boosted animals.
454525,"ah yes more veigar nerfs, exactly what he needs"
454538,"yes, everyone working at riot had shitty parents and that's why you're not getting what you want"
454556,should be much better to let you 1v3 mid huh
454594,"ye man, because typing status in cs console is only a 50% way lol"
454595,correcting mistakes is a little bit worse.
454607,man it's almost like the ps4 is just a second-rate pc in disguise or something.
454645,that sounds nothing like dark souls!
454705,that's why edge browser doesn't have them yet!
454752,i guess nerfing udyr like 20 times along with runic echoes was a good idea
454786,likely more popular than poro king
454803,"they aren't ignoring it, they're celebrating it with the release of the highly anticipated metroid prime federation force, which has been in development for 7 years, so it must be amazing!"
454836,"yeh, once this hits the front page, tyler's following will 100% disappear!"
454865,nothing wrong with valves patch and map policy
454888,"it's ok, they're fixing that in legion"
454894,"yes, let's learn say smokes for a map which is exiting the mappool."
454951,rip all the karma for this post
454961,guys... but we can't know he's hacking since there is no vac ban...and no witch hunting either
454966,this game is obviously the same exact game that activision's been re-releasing since 2007
454969,"but, but... 2001 was only 15 years ago!"
455025,"sure, lets cater reddit to your needs!"
455050,why would we implement talking orbs in csgo?
455080,"fix azir bugs, give him knockback on e, revert his w range nerf, thank you."
455094,more like star wars battlefield am i right?
455098,maybe stattrak for each colours too!
455164,but pcmasterrace... consoles are shit right?
455171,"you know a website is a good, reliable source of information when it has titles such as: ''ipad pro vs ipad air 2 vs ipad mini 4: who da boss?''"
455254,"volvo confirmed, skins = integrity of the game"
455323,i feel like using a clip where steel was smurfing was much more important.
455356,yes im sure top european teams will stop playing and earning big money because ibp got permanent bans for matchfixing
455357,"that's what they said last year, maybe thus will finally be the year!"
455365,yes because we all support ibp.
455428,"i don't think you understand, vayne has a lot of stealth and mobility"
455507,"ahh yes, because sitting in front of tv is widely accepted."
455510,yeap... the percantage will drop so hard if you do this... from 0% to 0% .
455575,"chelsea is a mid table team tho, i kind of expect it from them."
455589,how is this situation still pleasant :/
455670,i can't wait for all those psp+ vr indie titles
455736,"hey, at least **you** offered a constructive third option, without that we'd be stuck with shitty dynamic queues."
455762,great to see brainless mobile games on the xbox one...
455809,:) :) :) :) :) xd :d lol lololol ;) ;) &lt;:) not a scam -every scammer ever
455892,but where else can i talk about my skates and blops and other games i want on bc like skyrim
455924,then how does every child i see with a st vanilla karambit say they unboxed that shit?
455926,then you don't buy a 50$ rp card
455976,yes the game is totally unplayable if tick is set at 20.
455980,personally i'm waiting for golden abyss 2.
456021,it is not pornographic if it is educational or arts!
456023,"yeah, this picture really shows his computers capabilities"
456041,i guess that's why it was a roaring success.
456101,oh yeah wt had no impact what soever
456152,wow we haven't seen this one before
456156,oh they simply must i would be ever so sad if they didn't
456204,"ye but when flusha did it he only did it for publicity not because he cared, not like fallen"
456206,how dare you make sensible counter suggestions to a champ that's clearly op?
456222,"well, why are they not a 2/3 anymore, that's where the heart comes from!"
456269,i hear he just picks up his mouse a lot more then normal
456276,"it's just a bunch of numbers, how hard can it be?"
456322,"an extremely beginner friendly game is *dark souls*, it should be a breeze."
456350,this is why hades wont ever be on a top na team
456367,because murder is the same as shady business practices.
456393,"thanks, will totally do this next time!"
456411,"come on man... we both know that spelunky, super meat boy, and rogue legacy are all the same game"
456451,"send it to me, and i will take care of it"
456461,"if your ancestors are from indian subcontinent, i think is quite ok in terms of playing videogames"
456478,gotta slip in your true rank somewhere of course.
456522,yeah i bet they're pretty short on cash
456524,"nah, spending 100k on semphis and fns makes more sense..."
456535,this me is having some sick wr on this subreddit
456544,"nobody would tell lies like that on the internet, what would be the purpose!"
456570,nah riot would never do something like this
456705,"because amazon accounts are rare and valuable commodities and every single one has already been created; not like you can make another account or anything, right?"
456713,ya my buddy did some voice acting for it too!
456772,that guy pushing from palace was global before update
456810,"casting alone don't bring in enough of that skrilla, everyone knows that"
456822,"played beta, mouse clicks don't register in menu and sometimes don't fire, clearly they designed this for pc."
456853,yeah cause video games turn kids into violent criminals because they played a game on their xbox.
456872,but tahm was more of a problem than udyr!~!~
456878,these guys are asking the hard questions!
456913,"no, any code that doesn't work the way the end user expects is spagetti code."
456927,ofc not you just don't understand anything about the game you filthy redditor
456937,"this is reddit, it's not a repost because at least one person has not seen this before..."
457038,"or everything would be so broken, that nothing would be broken"
457054,"ofc it's intended, riot wants you to use 3rd party sites."
457074,"and it only took you, what, 20 years?"
457080,"it's eu, so the fact he dodged the ult makes it sooo goood"
457085,yeah i mean who has ever heard of styx right?
457099,"hl3 and hl2 ep 3 have been delay for 10 years because of source 3, only thing that fits"

457149,"but bullying is bad, stop bullying him s1mple, , by the way guys, did i tell you i go to the gym, and i have muscles, , confidence is everything and i'm definitely not just arrogant, ... do i even need the"
457153,"yeah, wales is ocean fish giant"
457155,"pfft, i guess it doesn't even matter then"
457191,"but dude, i'm not getting paid to smurf/call lower ranks bad, so it's totally ok for me to ruin 5 other players' fun."
457274,brb buying 100 hoping valve does this
457298,no sandbox mode to be toxic with so i guess just link the player advice boards to anyone who has a rough game.
457343,maybe they see my sick bhops and realise that i spent all my time on kz maps
457415,"they're making the assumption that black/white didn't get a 3rd version, and then they added black2/white2 in to that list, because they apparently are two separate games... makes complete sense!"
457417,"thanks for this post, i've never seen anything like it before."
457419,"nope, doesn't matter if they so different things and are different champs."
457426,"oh yeah, i forgot the laws are always right"
457446,"what the hell, 0 fps on these pc pic's consoles are so much better than pc!"
457462,"oh look it's this post again jayce, nidalee, udyr, elise, yasuo"
457479,so why are there more than 151?
457482,"but everything has to look like a michael bay movie nowadays ... more effects and explosions please, need rocket launcher asap"
457493,what do you even do in this game?
457494,will probably still use gamebryo and the creation engine
457503,but halo 2 had super advanced graphics that only vista would be able to support
457508,obviously on frontpage already if it was the man the myth the shroud himself.
457509,"how dare you support toyota, clearly suzuki is the better brand and your opinion is invalid."
457510,my friend and i* guess you spent too much time watching others and not paying attention.
457511,he should go to a bullying seminar and maybe he'll be fixed
457646,the rest of the 98% got 74 points
457682,"yeah, have them watch tv instead!"
457688,has everyone registered with geforce to received your e-mail driver updates yet?
457691,ye koo rich org and have alot sponsors
457748,but those indie games are in glorious 1080p!
457749,"couldn't agree with you and your downvotes more, sir or ma'am"
457757,welcome to reddit where trolls still exist and dont know how to
457780,luckily no one has smurfs for boosting up their friends.
457808,surely that would help against toxicity.
457831,"the only side that needs proof is the one that contradicts your opinion, man."
457850,so by every one logic nasus passive is broken because it helps him sustain
457893,im sure the battlefront subreddit will love that
457896,that's what you get for playing a male draenei
457996,"oh well probably forgot, surely nobody will abuse this"
458016,shaman still have to manage tidal waves yay
458024,you must be fun at parties then.

458071,they need to add support for american.
458090,yea man don't spoil the premiss of the game
458131,"because redditors hold themselves to a higher moral and value, right?"
458175,"another quality tournament with top tier teams, yay!"
458197,can't wait for this to come out and they lower the graphics!
458199,it would look like an indie game
458250,"against the rules to unplug your own pc, nothing against paying people to do it for you."
458300,so brave posting something about gun control on reddit.
458342,because reddit is totally representative of all the players in league.
458352,yes that's why the players wanted to keep him and decided to keep working with him.
458358,"oh no, how can i enjoy watching someone else play without being able to see their masteries"
458392,but ur on fnatic which is way better
458405,you can really feel the passion dig players have for the game.
458426,oh yeah dude cos travelling is totally the same as exploring a post-nuclear wasteland in virtual reality in the comfort of your own home.
458471,"yeah shotcalling is irrelevant, only need individual skill like lgd..."
458478,yes because pro csgo players are such high value targets.
458486,finally only valve would know that i play the newest dove dating sim
458493,by that logic china should be the best region
458503,yea the game is much more fun if every champion is the same in regards to what their kits do.
458573,"he understands the value of cover fire, some thing these kids not growing up in real war environments don't."
458642,i mean he his flair is global so...
458651,we are lucky that thooorin/monte told loco that kasing wasn't the main shotcaller on his team.
458658,he played well for a few days so clearly he is the best mid na.
458662,obviously you start cull on nasus for that sweet gold
458675,i'm sure if microsoft comes up with something pc gamers don't like they'll pay close attention and never repeat their mistakes.
458695,valve y u no unban swag deserve unban plzplzplzplzplzplzplz volvo plz swag did not rong he was advantaged plz
458714,delior and fnatic can turn any player into the best guysss
458720,why don't they just mix up the number bar like the rest of the keyboard?
458737,perfect landing in a perfect game
458757,valve has other games beside cs:go?
458765,they hate because they no not what they do.
458780,"yeah he rly got banned for that,indeed"
458787,"no, you must be in motion and in the middle of the map at all times"
458974,good shitpost op a blank piece of paper real funny
459042,because no one has any ap/ad at level 1...
459044,"nah we don't need it, we have dinosaur hunt on steam (formerly dinosaur hunt - africa contract)"
459340,just install chrome from the app store.
459544,"went 14-2 vs a leblanc yesterday as yas, are you saying that isn't supposed to happen?"
459719,fuck you for thinking that meme is still funny
459724,"loses to the team who got 3-0'd by skt, yeah we'd win the entire thing"
460376,"you deserved this, this is just as oppressive as telling people irl what to do or youll troll and feed"
460403,"nah, fiora is perfectly fine, she needs at least 5 q/passive procs to kill a 400 armor rammus"
460499,thresh should not be able to hook people as well!
460753,"also, the asus has a crosshair overlay function which makes it perfect for awp noscopes...absolute must have for faze clan members"
460782,"eh, it will probably be removed before it comes to euw"
460984,"nice tips dude, i'm sure they will help to decrease rammus's 54% winrate in solo queue as a top laner"
461060,you were missing a very crucial
461072,gonna go ahead and assume the title is missing
461168,no it was 1.1 seconds you fucking idiot
461169,don't fucking undercut him then.
461174,"yeah, those were definitely recent lans"
461374,didn't account for that wind resistance.
461425,"hilarious and original post m8, have my upvote"
461456,"ha, i'd like to see google's alphago beat *this* game."
461470,fucking 720p shadows makes this awesome looking game look like shit!
461558,trying to blame faceit for choking?
461763,"nuh uh, it's because intel is just anti-consumer and was purposely limiting gains because they hate consumers"
461933,"let's make the t spawn the a spot, so what if they go 15-0, we will have the same advantage next half!"
461962,because flashy camos give you +15% damage.
462018,but riot also doesn't know what western wants
462043,i'm not exactly 100% familiar with how far the movie plans to go but i wonder if they'll show.. [garona assassinating king llane or gul'dan telling garona she is actually half-draenei]
462067,maybe dont cheat and get banned on your main!
462068,"no, you stop, scope, flick, fire!"
462088,the bullet time thing was ripped straight out of gta.
462127,how has this been confirmed since you can't click them?
462310,"i mean they could also try to make a decent expansion again, but throwing money at other projects seem like a great idea to get people back..."
462360,"wow, didnt even show clg, so fucking bias"
462450,a team tries to have the best opportunity to win a round uhh loll what idiots
462545,dude they could just throw so a couple million each and they won't have to worry about life bans
462596,what are those white things the players keep putting in their hands?
462601,"no, not crazy at all to risk losing your map pick and potentially get beaten 2-0 in a million dollar major."
462657,because titanic never happened?
462676,hahah i was agreeing with u at first and then...
462760,"yeah, 99% of the people on youtube are definitely making bank."
462766,you mean c9 during the summer before all the addreal shit happened?

463018,"dirty whore ,i bet you don't even play video games, you're one of those fake gamer guys."
463064,"if they're nerfing rageblade, surely rito will remember to give compensation buffs to champions that got nerfed because of that item such as jax"
463097,"splyce lost, so it was obviously ddos."
463129,does that make fnatic a uk team?
463138,ya because that is exactly the kind of response mlg has been giving to feedback so far
463257,"my winrate is 90% in season 4, zed is op"
463274,this tip will help you tremendously in that area: don't stand still in areas that has boulders rolling through them.
463313,no one is going to disagree with you because you can't surf reddit on a console.
463357,"ugh it looks like such a bad game, sony should just put it on igc right away so maybe people will actually play it."
463514,"because they didn't fuck up, it's their philosophy!"
463608,i wonder why lolesports never had this feature
463645,yes and make it so that you can't even touch inhibiter turrets before all outer turrets are gone in every lane as well.
463651,"yeah, this might take talent and shit, but if really want to be in the cosplay world, you have to turn into a dragon"
463676,"yeah team sent him to split push vs gragas so he cant tp, but bronze redditor knew better."
463701,"yeah, the last teamfight, the 4 man alistar knock up that won them the game and his peel for doublelift were super bad."
463712,"well i'm pretty sure its sneaky jungle, rush adc, impact support, bunny top and lemonnation middle."
463732,what an absurd way of thinking.
463773,because the current expansion always sucks and the previous one was the best one created.
463791,because disney made it so obviously it's shit.
463860,three years just for some karma?
463927,sounds like that team would have a nice synergy with all the switches
463959,"i cant stop laughing at damage charts, funniest thing i've ever seen in my life."

464654,"think about this, if it never comes back up and they promise to reimburse for the days we lost, we get unlimited ps+"
464672,it won't cure it but it will certainly cause it

465168,watching 5 pros stomp lower elo premades (who are not even full 5mans themselves half the time) is sooo exciting.
465184,"yeah, like how valve charged us for gloves"
465231,obviously top tier quality can't be shown against non top 5 teams...
465284,"nice video, though i don't seem to recall any dubstep my first night."
465287,"if you're good at zed, you want to make sure you waste extra time and damage on a target that will die anyway, instead of doing anything else."
465314,you took down a base with no one in it... so amazing.

465344,yeah better concntrate on watching the clock for half an hour
465356,"yeah well, i'd be challenger if it wasn't for my teammates."
465409,riot is doing everything to give na an edge .. first bo3 for na and now they can play ranked a day longer than us ...
465446,so this is where their money is going to instead of further development to the game.. no wonder we're getting things cut already!

465930,why have adren when they can just buy an awp and a decoy
465938,"and lux, and caitlyn and jinx and ezreal"
465946,"riot: i mean, you poor canadians could always get that shiny assassin master yi or that white mage veigar!"

472921,"dude don't overhype it, that shit is bronze iv tops 5/7"
472937,it was a joke haha i guess i really need to put
473006,who knew that if you made champs that are strong but immobile not strong that they wouldn't be worth playing?
473017,if the koreans touch csgo its basicly over for the west
473022,that doesn't sound like something that would break the client.

473059,"yeah, straight to the feelings... i bet they cry themselves to sleep"
473121,he is american so obviously he knows all about how toxic euw is.
473122,i would want to find a spot where i can see 1/3 of at least 2-3 of the player's heads so i might be able to glimpse their reaction from a play i assume happened because i was too busy watching the fraction of their head instead of the actual game.
473230,good and completely unbiased video
473327,love that 40 min power spike fam
473335,"totally worth a new controllers price tag,"
473438,the current expansion totally fixed that.
473492,but he played good at the major so it cancels out everything he did the year before
473545,"look, this is what happens when blizzard try to please the filthy casuals who want to be the best player without playing!"
473564,"theres games with gold we offer to gold members each month, 2 games from our fantastic collection"
473598,at least he is improving his movement
473610,smh americans with their exuses
473621,because redditors think they are all challenger and would of made that play work
473625,"sheesh, start a weeb club already"
473641,but shadowx93ca the game starts at 90 dont you know all old content is usless omg shutup about nost if people wanted that blizz would make it the game was more casual friendly back then also this one time i had a bad time in vanilla ergo its terrible and nobody should ever want it again so stop pretending to shut up
473730,"hey now, christ was crucified- he didn't walk around with his titties hanging out.."
473749,"implying valve reads emails, steam is very well known for their worldwide customer support!"
473751,but mario 3d world is good enough!
473756,but you can download all the same old games you have been playing for the past 20 years via the virtual console!
473757,lotta cartel members in this sub yikes
473786,or you're cheating and this is just the gotv pov
473827,with this ban rates i think this top-banned champions had 4 games played which is for sure enough to provide complete stats
473979,that's what they want you to believe!
474014,"wtf... some people.. first we need a server for french people, i dont wanna have those nobbs in my team every game"
474028,"no, they should be working for me!"
474122,"because he uses his throat to blow darts, this is obviously hinting that dead eye targets the source of the champion's powers..."
474185,a man chooses a slave (who) obeys?
474203,"i like hers actually (especially the cat), her boobs look as fake as ingame tho... and the zyra+cassiopeia looks good too"
474242,"yep, getting challenger in s3 meant nothing"
474260,but i thought everyone in this subreddit was challenger?
474300,"no, this image was rendered in ue4."
474312,i will forward this to hack coding friends
474324,this game really was better back in the day!
474398,"im currently dmg over 1k in this game, i could give you , hmu."
474427,"nah, bot xavier got this shit, dont worry"
474438,tl;dr: let's wait until nobody talks about it then run the cblol with the irregular team.
474561,"yes, i'm sure his winrate is close to 100%"
474571,"sure, morrowind wasn't innovative at all."
474706,"its actually more, 4/10 converts into 28/70 and 5/7 to 50/70 so your wrong"
474756,"dude, dennis doesnt take eco frags like others in fnatic, listen to vladskiua, its all about impact frags."
474763,"because there's more europeans in na then there is in eu, duh."
474764,"dl dont really watch teams outside na, looking at his individual performance in international events, its not his best idea"
474854,what you dont believe everything you see on the internet?
474897,it increases the skill ceiling of the game so the answer is obvious.
474900,be careful with those microaggressions...
474965,i thought he was console only trying to say how cinematic 30fps is.
475052,everyone knows that literal means metaphorical these days.
475053,"man that reddit guy, can't make up his mind right?"
475152,he seems like such a composed guy
475159,how do we know it's not two r9 390m mxm modules?
475183,"they lost 2 games with bunny, he obviously will never work with the team and they should just fire him right now."
475213,but riot clearly solved all visa problems in season 3
475228,here we can see the fine art of lifting your mouse
475253,i don't agree with your opinion.
475345,cause video games have spaceships duuuhhh
475447,im ready to see stewie go off and carry this lan!
475551,"i just love reddit, someone actually downvoted op for not watching rick and morty, fantastic."
475552,which summoners are u talking about bruh
475553,glad so many people care more for others to improve rather than improving themself
475554,"you have to open a crate after every single game, and depending on the colour, your next game will have more impact on the result."
475584,"but that soviet installation though, it proves the game is just a piss poor console port!"
475626,"yeah, but you have the incorrect ones."
475627,no wonder he has vac in the name
475673,"it has something to do with refugees, therefore it's automatically racism!"
475674,you know i really didn't think i needed a
475691,yeah because clearly there's no way tsm will improve in 6 months.
475692,rws is the best/most accurate system of displaying skill :d
475708,maybe rlewis was hinting at something...
475778,and then increasing his shadow range for no reason because zed's harass isn't safe enough already
475869,yeah its ok he's worked hard for this rare moment in his life and it's being hurt by coaching just a vidya game
475870,"wow, i didn't think they still made these games"
475898,"dont worry guys, riot will give us bonus ip week to compensate for server downtime."
476008,yeah i've definitely never heard anyone mention their semifinal finish at the major after beating vp and not to mention the fact that they were close to upsetting envyus.
476026,"he clearly ruined the value of the sand dune, what a waste."
476033,"tanky stats on her w, 3 cc abilities, a passive that grants extra damage for allies what a bad support 0/10 wouldn't play"
476085,at least it isn't as bad as psn
476089,"yeah, but does it work on slight inclines?"
476156,"yeah, we totally need more reposts on reddit."
476195,everything got better with realplayer
476217,switched from tsm to astralis because tsm suddenly loses vs na teams
476235,"while we are removing items we might as well remove anything that makes champions do damage, because having items that make you stronger is just broken."
476238,i heard someone talking about broken clocks earlier
476243,"probably meant to bid on that sweet monkey pet, but misclicked."
476247,clearly we're gonna win the league now...undefeated streak incoming.
476254,"wow, the things valve do just to spite ex-ibp"
476258,afking in dota while going hard in the paint on their smurf accounts
476271,yeah i seriously doubt they've even realized people cheat in this game.
476391,b-b-b-but the 30 seconds it takes for bans is too long!
476415,yeah not like dig have been anybody recently their just some shit european team
476419,"yeah the same mid-split push on b, spraying kucher and hiko killing hr players with pistol/15 hp was the best game!"
476464,have you got the elder scrolls online plat ?
476469,"yeah , because we fking love ties in eu ."
476471,m8 it's all supply and demand i had a lesson about it in primary
476484,the best 2 hours of my life ... half
476538,inb4 nip fans will point lasers in navi players' eyes and nip goes to finals and beat nv using same strategy
476539,but he has to watch girls in his video game
476564,i don't experience any of this toxicity in any other games except league.
476606,"you're right, smiles and handshakes do offer return on investments."
476649,nip is the one of the best organisations out there guys.
476691,to test out all the latest new skins bruh
476707,"i think you fucked up op, you posted the same picture twice."
476717,and somehow ps4 still has no games.
476729,no way... pain has beaten clg at worlds
476736,"yup, that's all the ashbringer has."
476743,clearly he must not be as good as godv.
476754,"hey, i may be silver 3 but i could be ge or pro easily if it wasn't for hackers and smurfs"
476763,oh yeah because we all are so sure we get loads of free content with all the other priced blizzard titles...
476766,they might run out of digital copies.
476769,especially majority of redditors they've played with.
476772,"no, don't you know, you are supposed to rank straight in at lem with no previous fps experience, and then express disbelief that anyone in silver/nova can play that bad?"
476815,because it's definitely fun to play a game with an uncoordinated team vs a fully coordinated communicating team
476851,what are you talking about that was obviously a skilled shot.
476856,"don't know what this elder scrolls is, but i'm hyped for skyrim 2!"
476926,"but one thing they didn't point out is that shoulder peeking is when you show only your shoulder to bait a shot, especially an awp."
476927,op just wanted to show off his mounts
476935,"'uh the guy at best buy said it's a *gaming* laptop, why cant i play ultra 200fps?'"
476970,unrealistic propane reaction 2/10 worst goty bethesda gib reffund
477009,"yes, i should lose 1000$ and 2-3 years of dedication to a game because i got a single virus."
477022,"great, if you are forced last pick now in ranked, pick bard and crash the game for a loss prevented :p"
477039,but it's obviously a very dynamic game!
477075,"youre right 9k for a closed beta is so shit, look at the 900 blade and soul viewers, 600 dirty bomb viewers, and 0 gigantic viewers!"
477084,"yeah, he should totally be doing all this work and research for riot while playing this game, that's totally acceptable."
477112,"no, organizations should be expected to ditch the possibility of making over a million so they can play a single split and get relegated with their non top tier players."
477115,wat lol i guess i'm the only person who needs to add a
477169,not if even season froggen has anything to say about it.
477182,i was expecting every game i didn't already own plus 2 free xbox ones.
477219,well you're in luck because a lot of black friday sales are already putting this game down in the $20-25 range.
477229,"paris is great example since the terrorists had legal weapons, gun control really helped there."
477233,"well damn, we can get stuck with the br people but not you guys totally not fair"
477236,"yeah, all those fines in the nba have kept him from speaking his mind, and i think i heard he wants to sell the mavs because he's tired of getting fined"
477254,yeah i find it really annoying any gun is allowed on dm players should be able to select if dm should be knife only or not!
477259,"yeah, instead they've gone for macrotransactions (dlc)."
477280,oh yeah... i'm supposed to be saving my son... what's his name again?
477383,can't you tell he has the latest gaming chair and best headset on the market
477414,"i only play with the scout so i've actually bound both jump and shoot to space, my aim has never been steadier!"
477428,omg we will have 120fps games now!
477498,a time traveler who went back in time with his friends to get high as fuck in the pre war obviously
477506,but...but his win rate is low!
477531,"but then again, it's canada.. it's like a whole different world.."
477532,"10/10, would accuse for scripting"
477541,so they buffed nidalee's q into a point-and-click skill while keeping the range
477543,"yes, my smurf has the 2015 service medal and skins."
477557,omfg l34rn w0t aram m3ans n00b.
477560,because my opinion matters over yours and you're not allowed to enjoy the things more than i do or you're a nerd or a weirdo.
477562,but riot wanted to let teams get exposure while the league was in its infancy!
477591,hey look you win the award for most original joke of the year
478073,dynamic queue the best ever system to be released by riot.
478174,"nice scripting dude, no way you could.have those sick mechanonks"
478349,haven't you heard of the 3 awp mid strat?
478371,oh yeah because the playstation network announces that all digital games are buy one get one free right?
478428,"oh yeah, rewarding you for having detailed knowledge of the boss encounter is a totally unoriginal and uninteresting idea"
478786,since when does ac support +60 fps
478947,ill try this in the middle of a league game
479076,what you talking about this tsm vs ren game so exiciting
479084,i'd personally recommend an airport bathroom.
479099,"well whenever i try playing mid, the enemy team has two mid laners, and one of them always have smite and comes from the sides."
479109,bjerg must've gotten fined so hard for each fan he didn't high five after that game where he felt sick
479110,wait a few years and they'll throw all of this development out the window too
479173,i'm sure everyone is very proud of you
479239,because games with in-game voice comms are so less toxic and much more social.
479376,you should have clutched if you didn't want to get kicked
479479,"no he's totally right and the rest of the fucking world is wrong, dark souls is basically my little pony"
479624,"no, you clearly need white people to explain you what is racist what is not."
480208,"xin zhao is a very strong and resilient guy, and in a way he reminds me of your mother, they are both very easy to pick up"
480283,downvoting you because you're not my real dad.
480342,saying someone is salty is an unstoppable argument!
480365,damn riot stop giving skins to other champions when annie clearly needs a new skin
480415,since reddit hates regi now i think you can also blame him for loco leaving too.
480468,what an insightful meme...certainly never seen this here before.
480491,well i for one only have fun on consoles that sell well
480556,yea but then all the people who already know what the game is can't feel cooler than the people who don't know what game it is.
480644,what about warcraft 4 you damned heretic?
480698,clearly not good enough for riot to match the pay that casters in other games get though!
480700,"what do you mean, you can clearly see the alligator clips on the bomb."
480707,yes by bringing islamist into europe we are saved!
480771,"if it isn't rise mountain, i'm not really sure anyone's been paying attention the last two years."
480798,"ohhh, a cell phone number, too!"
480804,omg the cracks not even worst rp creator ever.
480849,no we just all need a thicker skin
480931,"champions have a passive, renekton doesnt"
481039,yeah 2v5 bots were sooo much fun
481193,he's preparing to replace svenskeren in tsm for the summer split
481263,i too miss the days when xbox exclusives weren't available on any windows version
481265,because i just said i'm totally sexualizing child-like characters
481336,yes we should redraw until na doesn't play each other
481337,"wow what an incredibly normal angle, insane play"
481380,"nikasaur killing phreak and replacing him, curing us of flanderization and bringing forth a new age of weekly quality fan art submissions, with added mspaint rp submissions."
481423,"what are you, some kind of fucking idiot?"
481432,oh yeah like no one else has ever done that
481488,they can't figure out how to balance genji so they hope players will play him less if he doesn't have any legendary skins.
481502,"riot illuminati confirmed, trick people into thinking they can be toxic for free and encouraging more toxicity for the $$$ before they ban someone"
481593,"nah mate, i don't wanna get shanked."
481618,i bet flusha regrets his decision now.
481720,atleast one adren can do something
481739,just buff his q and w but remove the combo :^)
481749,"much like hy-brasil, zandalar certainly is not sinking."
481761,but guys think of all the key fragments
481764,"but don't you know, if you purchase a season pass, you are supporting gaming hitler right?"
481766,just carry hard enough to be in diamond elo if you want soloq so badly
481787,c9 -ska -shroud -n0thing -stewie +s1mple
481831,complexity are just going to stack a ton of mediocre players to form 1 super player just like power rangers.
481900,cheated so had to transport inventory
481931,goldshire is the only place normal rp happens
481962,nope won't work on karthus because his aa take longer than the ibg slow.
482035,to prove that the match yesterday wasn't fixed.
482051,"pretty sure he's hispanic, mate."
482104,"nah dude obv cheaters, they got like 2 headshots in a row"
482163,how did you get that vac lifted?
482241,of course it is.. this game really needed to be made.
482331,i hated how it wasn't any more difficult for me because i speak korean
482362,"they have godren now, they'll win the next major."
482369,new meta: complain about hand/wrist/arm injury after bad performances
482370,if yam can 40 bomb every game they might be pretty good!
482436,you play 3 fourths of a game and then ragequit?
482437,hour of victory has some pretty neat install music and pics.
482470,stop playing against trick2g in season 3 and 4.
482544,yeah we totally need proof to believe at least 1 person is using an aimbot in a popular online fps with a *free* beta period
482554,yeh repeating the same fucking raid weeks on weeks on different difficulties is fun as shit.
482562,so we need dominion back so bots can have the place all to themselves.
482564,"no, that's just the natural product cycle."
482569,yeah wearing mixed aq/bwl gear looked really epic...
482616,"but if your friend can just come to your place to play the game, then they don't have to buy the game too!"
482687,they sure threw out a bunch of content patches in wod
482689,but who will happy bait in a 1v1?
482706,"yeah, it's not about the us, how useless."
482949,you know technically if you would just take some time to *learn the spray control* then you would find it is statistically the deadliest gun in the game.
482952,stop spreading false information
483107,yea let's tune the game specifically for the small amount of people going for world's first...
483212,yes because they are activly trying to kill their game
483215,"yeah don't forget that giving consumers more choices is screwing them over, having less choices is pro-consumer!"
483240,but the human eye can't see past 30 fps
483259,"yeah, no other game ever has their servers go down for unexplained reasons!"
483293,"it is really hard for sure to detect someone who stacks tears/zeals, buy mobi + alacrity and go 0/30"
483298,"obviously fake, april 11th 2016 has already passed."
483320,yeah because we're really seeing a lot of updates and bug fixes
483361,gods spaghetti coding is what caused it
483448,they should disable all 4 for this
483590,his teammates should have placed a ward so that thresh can hook himself out
483605,it's not incest if they're bisexual sisters
483609,i'm mge but before the update i was le
483654,they're trying to actually get people to play dominion
483663,waiting for kio and happy to pop.
483681,because who doesn't have a full build at 9 minutes right?
483700,"man really wish he would sue, it makes the most sense!"
483744,"the opposite of a forward step, duhhh!"
483853,"sorry, now your opinion is invalid"
483947,"yeah, it's not that it has something to do with our modern society or something, everybody just says hey, let's just get depression, everyone else has it so it must be so cool."
483963,i guess it's time to spam google search with csgo
483975,at least better than csgo inferno
484025,"yeah, the devs of the top fps game don't know how to update th code"
484066,it probably took them so long to get everything set up with all that ice.
484078,"ah, i thought riot had gone soft with the mini games for jhin, glad to see they are back with them here"
484113,maybe dying while untargetable is an intended feature
484123,"yeah you're right, we can totally jump to this conclusion after one game"
484125,"lets be real though, when was the last time tsa let a bomb through the gate?"
484158,"yea, like you are not entitled for pay while working under someone elses employment"
484159,but he totally grew up as old and wise mothafucka over the years right
484161,because this was apparently intentional.
484174,ikr everyone must find the same games boring as u kek
484181,"no, evolution studios are just wasting their time giving out updates"
484208,"but minimalism is on the way in right now, we need it to look trendy rather than have it be functional"
484210,dude you are a genius i've never heard this idea before
484278,"the solution is always playing with friends, playing with friends is fun and necessary even in ranked so why you wouldn't play 5 premade blind pick to try him?"
484312,looks like they buffed aimpunch
484321,yes there will be anarchy because the teams have one 2 man premade less
484350,"there was no ninja defuse, this is a bunch of lies."
484360,don't be silly... that will be a mid game kill streak reward
484362,as opposed to lee sin who's constantly out of meta
484417,oh hey next we should lynch lucian players for trying to steal his wife's soul back from you.
484441,"what game is this, i wish people would put games in their titles."
484463,just like rito predicted all these dynamic 5 man queues are close games.
484503,"well the guy didnt kill him because he was shroud, if it was anyone else he would have knifed him, therefore shroud has an unfair advantage simply by being himself."
484510,i love how dangerous the enemies are.
484511,"link is in mario kart 8, it should also be counted at a loz game!"
484568,so much for all of that stability they keep adding in... the system couldn't handle it!
484691,"yeah obviously you have some inside knowledge and not just guessing, yeah fuck you xbox"
484730,we can enjoy the view from our garrisons
484744,worlds stats has confirmed that.
484817,muh protadin class distinction fantasy is ruined by this toy pls remove
484896,til steam site devs are actually the csgo dev team
484998,"yea, because the weed available in amsterdam isn't available in rotterdam."
485007,"yeah, freeze had such a great team in eu."
485034,"this is the final nail in the silicon coffin, pc gaming is gonna die!"
485048,why would you listen to pita when someone from this subreddit already made a thread about it?
485121,but the eye can not see beyond 720p and 24fps.
485145,"i can't, i need an extra slot for wards."
485156,yeah when you recall you get tear and cloth armor and it allows you to outtrade their bf sword!
485224,i feel it is bad because certain champions like master yi are so unbalanced and have no counter play
485246,yeah that's why all the pros use it
485249,did you try using your left hand?
485253,"clearly you don't, riot said so!"
485299,it would be 4/5ths because russians aren't human beings
485395,lunatone and solrock confirmed new legendaries
485402,"wait, there was an expansion between wrath and mop?"
485414,"it's not like i could find cheats on google anyways, right?"
485427,nah man it totally has nothing to do with na not having any leadership whatsoever and new igl's at all man hazed just wants to collect his super high salary and never practice.
485500,it's shocking how riot can let the growth of their game go unchecked and let the game files get so large!
485508,"no such thing as a smurf, just bad silvers."
485515,we should just give korea every spot and let the kr challenger teams compete at worlds
485532,judging from what i've heard it's called over there
485598,isnt that already in the game cuz i always lag after stepping on one
485616,does happen to be very cinematic though.
485642,"nah, wifes leave with 50% of everything you have + will ever get"
485656,"this isn't minecraft, it's gta 5 on last gen"
485685,yeah because you can only play jrpg's on ps4.
485726,pineapple pizza can be used as a weapon and a shield?
485766,"i hate tim allen, i'm still downvoting!"
485800,servers couldn't handle the bandwidth.
485843,"frontpage already if it was shroud, just saying."
485853,"its vavles way of stopping all the dupping, more drops means less need for dupping"
485858,incredible mediocrity* im was truly a god tier korean team
485892,it's a good thing bathesda has always had shitty dlcs with poor quality to give us a good reason to doubt them.
485922,will there be a cosmetic dlc to make the game look like the original e3 demo?
485939,yea and because of that nip barely won !
485968,"looking at their performance from worlds, i don't know if any of they know what tahm kench even does."
485974,"ah, so this is what the cs:go console port looked like"
486011,"just like how skt has faker and bang, so they only put marin on utility champions because he can't carry, amirite?"
486049,"when people start attacking the words written rather than the point of debate, you know they mean business"
486055,"alright, i just noticed that you dropped this:"
486059,i can't wait to kill my enemies in cold blood
486064,"idk its pretty hard to run games with a 5820k and a 980ti at 5k, i think they need to address the .01%."
486065,if you zoom in 1000% you can see a tiny difference.
486092,so basically scotland and england?
486094,someone's defending their own game shocking

491015,"i'm actually pretty mad, yes, thank you."
491111,"damn dude, a windwall that lasts like ~4 seconds against an ability (that isn't even his core ability to coutner yasuo) that has a 3 second cooldown, if caught (14 if not caught), damn that's smart"
491186,did he managed to pre-order legion with his bare feet?
491231,"luckily no gamename in the title, couldnt handle the creepiness anyway"
491248,since he is an excellent clutcher here you forgot this

492248,"yea, they should let tanks beat the shit out of fighter champions, thats balanced as hell."
492309,"who cares about winning, take all the cs and all the kills don't let the carries get anything because your personal cs is the most important part of the game."
492375,"no, it's a joke about the other boaty mcboatface"
492470,is there some confusion with open meaning closed?
492498,can't wait to see you say that a 3d or 4th time when the game actually releases.
492513,"given your nickname, are you trying to find reasons to lead a new drama thread bacause women's boobs are too jiggly ?"
492537,"no, when the game comes out there will be 0 heroes available to play and you will lose the skins that you paid for"
492574,"yeah, it would be so hard to /mute all... can't even imagine"
492626,-sgares -m0e -ryx -roca -a2z +a2z

493096,"no, if they didn't not invite the valve devs to azk's birthday party"
493171,"fuck off, i don't need your advice"

493379,nice now we just need piccaboo to go to japan...
493384,"yeah, everything is that simple."
493440,maybe its because your on the league of legends subreddit
493441,but it's ok because ms obviously needs the money to make dlc.
493469,just need to be doublelift or gosu and you got that pesky rengar
493497,2-0ing fnc and tqm while being igl drunk
493531,can't wait for the camera to pan the arena during a 1v1 clutch
493533,yep in le hidden gem the witcher 3 the buildings would be gone and villagers would comment on it back in town.
493613,"yeah, reddit is some super secret club that only the few know of"
493634,now that sewage2k is on the team they should be great.
493636,a few people on a shitty message board that doesn't rep the entire community is a perfect reason to call it toxic.
493645,"lee sin is at 45%, guess he needs massive buffs"
493650,why would they spend time policing their games when the users will do it for them?
493689,we should never post articles because the news isn't brand new
493709,the *only* option they had was to throw.
493733,"but nooo, ooobisoft is literally hitler."
493734,"yeah, it's better for them to choose a secondary role that they aren't going to play."
493785,no but this one has twitch chat xd
493789,don't worry the 2 armor nerf he's getting will set him back into the stone age
493813,some fine gank right there ladies and gentlemen
493903,or maybe because they are in na ?
493911,"no, you just put the 5 best kda players from a region on a team and rake in the major wins."
493939,"well, looking at jhin's passive, i think we can all agree riot is pretty amazing at explaining stuff."
493983,"apparently many people did, this is getting a lot of upvotes."
493985,are they constantly playing carnival music?
494002,and also one of the most disappointing
494006,i thought they said it was removed from one map because it [blows up to become the rest of the broken shore?]
494026,yeah..because someone picking a champion they've never played in ranked surely is fun
494031,it's because positivity is not allowed within this community asshole
494041,how else am i supposed to justify spending a lot of money on a dragon lore?
494056,"sure, because fnatic has history of getting rekt by na teams, right?"
494082,"i have to disagree, it would be more like 4.5 people."
494086,"i dunno man i spent hours angling her ponytail just to look at her butt, but it always covered it!"
494092,"armor lock, evade, sprint, jet packs, holograms, and drop shields was definitely way more logical you're right."
494114,not if you want a cinematic experience
494152,"he's just trying out a new way to sit, bastards."
494171,"you're probably right, one person just decides to mess with the numbers on a champ, why would they consult the entire balance team?"
494209,"as a jungle main, we get blamed for everything else anyways, so i fail to see the difference."
494229,yeah just like nobody cared abouy apdos ban
494238,dear god was free with games with gold a while back.
494275,oh you kids these days are so spoiled with your 225 ip games back in my day we got 70 ip a game and we loved it
494276,the crew has open world radio towers what else could want from a ubisoft game!
494314,anecdotal evidence is best evidence.
494318,"i've never actually seen it work, but russian kids think it help if you just yell kick me kick me kick me every second they're alive, maybe you should try that!"
494334,from the inevitable bankruptcy that reddit/the internet believes is coming
494409,so i must be better than na pros now
494442,so what you're saying is that skadoodle and freakazoid aren't following the strat.
494460,"based on the ass selfies in yoga pants, duh."
494489,"but they can't, they put a daemon on the cover of the last game."
494537,no it means the game is balanced.
494601,there was something called dominion?
494651,nintendo usually releases the same games over and over
494711,riot is waiting for everyone to stop moaning and complaining about not having it before they release it.
494712,"yeh, he shotcall and led a team to semi's at worlds, he really can't shotcall."
494747,good game and white pride totally unrelated tattoos
494757,the potential to all in and get a kill/maximize a trade is not very important i guess.
494764,"nopw, no one...its not even a little bit awesome or popular."
494802,"just like how digital music is more expensive than physical music because apple doesn't want to piss off the brick and mortar stores, right?"
494818,but do you know when they are starting the wave ?
494852,that's like saying hitler was immune to being judged
494897,because it's totally the same thing as freak said
495016,"you only opened the weapon case, you didn't open the accessory case to get the silencer, so stop complaining!"
495026,but i thought mobifire was the central hub
495029,"yea, pretty sad that those lcs noobs actually played this shitty game mode huh?"
495035,lmao yeah you're right that's exactly how i am.
495047,"ez, let me just go to my nonexistent local isp and get 50mbs"
495055,"well, not unless they carry the bomb"
495064,seems like such an inconvenience to deal with to get a 1 year visa
495174,"yeah, there are only pirates on pc."
495243,when are the tracer body pillows coming.
495270,"yeah watch the current game, reaaally passive"
495331,yeah that's what for flairs are
495332,as a person who games on the eu servers i feel it is my civic duty to whine in the tag thread and post emails to blizzard demanding beta access.
495334,"now that halo 5 is out, they've shut it down."
495348,anything that isn't a realistic shooter is a tf2 clone
495356,but 2 years ago i once got 3 kills with a deagle on pistol round so its definately worth buying every time
495372,so you have proof of vote brigading..i see
495398,hes good at the game which means he made esports what it is today obviosuly god you scrubs understand nothing am i the only one here thats challenger?
495413,"obviously, but that would take the fun out of being an anonymous username on reddit!"
495422,tell that to shen's fucking katanas
495434,and these reports will be so effective
495471,"i prefer the triple pickaxe build myself, one for hydra, one for lw, one for ie"
495494,"typical reddit comment, baseless prediction with no source..."
495514,more kat skins obviously because we are getting close to a year without one.
495522,i'm pretty sure xiaoweixiao offers chinese lessons for $1400
495537,"yeah good thing they take good care of established lore, just like fallout 3"
495546,max life against max life percentage hp true dmg sounds good
495575,"pour milk on your router, it always worked for me"
495583,it's not like some kid is going to see win free skins at csgo skintaker.com and not want to go there.
495591,but 30 is so much more cinematic
495596,i can see that you're a city fan
495611,"with all these new changes in na lcs, i don't think north america will be prepared for international tournaments, as they always are."
495634,"my mommy who i still live with bought me toys because she knows how much i like a game, go me!!"
495641,"wow, a bug looking thing inside a bethesda game, nooo never seen that happen"
495656,i too hate the growth of competition in cs:go!
495679,"that strength helps me do strong heals brah, don't you know itemization?"
495714,so sad to not have 45 min games where we're down 30 kills and my team still refuses to ff
495722,"i hate it when i can't see my gun, has to be gold with shining diamonds boyzzz"
495762,we all know that the europeans had to group into one region since the individual countries couldn't stand up to the greatness of america
495765,clearly the radioactive wasteland caused all the lead to decay into steel.
495766,meanwhile kiwikid still stealing pay
495803,i mean he's only been on reddit for one more year than you
495824,nintendo didn't want all the 12 year olds saying i fucked your mom on their severs.
495840,nah eu is sending young stars like xpeke and leaving old mid laners like febiven back in eu.
495855,do you also want it to make you a snack?
495864,"damn knockoffs, sorry op we all have parents that have gotten us gamekids, polystations, now pipboxes... i feel for you bro."
495865,i only play vs people with so shitty aim that the pistol inaccuracy finds a way
495905,im really happy that i didnt listen to them when they told me to always give mid blue now im a toxic jungle main
495929,the amount of pre-orders was so low they pushed the game back.
495956,oh yeah this one isolated incident is surely a sign that nobody in na knows anything about sportsmanship.
495957,poor kids seem bored and inattentive :( i hope you find something fun for them to watch
495992,gamestop should be able to give you about $5 credit for your trade in.
496065,because they're bad and you shouldn't like them because they are bad
496075,"pshh, a scabrous retcon at best!"
496076,"totally, because tf is meant to play for the late game."
496085,"yeah, ranked matchmaking is serious esports."
496088,oh hey maybe op will read this and be your wife and live out your childhood fantasy!

496115,"all of them, might as well quick switch when reloading the knife too"
496146,"nooo bro, sgares is a god among men in terms of work ethic, thats why his team was always on top"
496181,"also zed if he doesn't use q or e, and only auto attacks"
496214,"0/10, the yellow controller isn't the dk64 banana controller."
496231,yeah there is not really any hype for kt coco ofc!
496270,but preorders are evil and destroy games.
496285,"minion block has always been around, riot just recently buffed it to also affect ranged champions, to make the game more fair."
496308,"damn, there adding an update that was suppose to happen 11 months ago.. hype."
496333,because season 2 will be included with halo wars 2 special edition
496354,master chief and nathan drake will be announced as playable characters

500523,obviously he was kicked for being toxicelele.
500656,he wasn't removed from the practise and replaced by another guy as much as he was gently excused from the pressure of playing with the team for a temporary period of time.
500674,"so they're not maining fizz, and thus good people."
500687,brother let me tell you something this is indeed.
500688,if only this wasn't posted before on this sub
500697,"yeah, there's such a great taboo about the butt in video games, you're such a champion of women's issues!"
500735,makes sense to me... tf2 is definitely more competitive than csgo
500841,timthetatman and summit1g as 4 and 5.

510420,but how else should we show that one is obviously better the others?
510426,yea no skill just pure time investment right?
510449,being in every season finale and winning 3 of them clearly means they are a team that can only show up in scrims obviously
510537,there's no way that looks like a general keyboard warrior raging at me!
510541,"git gud, you should have stopped moving, stay silver"
510550,w is mediocre at best ... being able to return a tf gold card is mediocre

510568,"shh, gotta stay with the circlejerk of hating on nasty devs and a dying game!"
510576,"just a month, gives you time off cs."

511173,"well minecraft was barely lucrative after all, just a small indie game."
511281,no they weren't interested in him last year that obviously mean they don't really want him so he won't go even if it's a way better team.
511285,nah halo is much more comparable to lol than dota is!
511286,riot is a bigger game than ff you can't compare the two!
511314,"why are you picking such an op player to standin, thats cheating"
511319,"yeah fuck charity, riot should just give away this 2nd skin instead of trying to help people."
511338,"h-hey now paparazzis take pictures, while lewis just writes, there is a clear and certain difference"

511737,i just made silver today am i on track to try out?
511741,but hey... we're a great university town!
511776,"because it's not the original console, of course."

512220,culter's will look like a penis no doubt that's if his team could do anything
512234,getting killed in 0.10 secs by ekko doesn't seem assasin like at all...
512250,"yeah garen and darius totally need skillshots, that'll fit their kit"
512284,"like olof he's an elite level rifler and awper (i would argue top ten in both and probably top 5 rifle), probably the best pistol player in the game, has great game sense, plays smart, good in clutches, gets a lot of impact kills, and in the last 3 months has 1.26 k:d overall and averages 20 kills a game when he's constantly playing the best teams in the world and is the highest rated player on tsm (probably the best team in the world at the moment) but yeah, all he does is be on tsm"

522687,kennen is such a complicated champ
522693,"more like, we got europeans to shit on europeans cause europeans dont like to see europeans succeed."
522733,and if he gets the kill you flame him and say you gonna afk next time?
522740,reminds me of seth rollins last night.

523023,you were actually the first to state that his actions were over the top.
523039,i think he became the lich king was because he was literally on fire and wanted a cool place to sit down.
523063,i only play karthus with subtitles because if you don't play in true shadow isle tongue you miss too much context
523110,did they bring anime avatars too?

523306,"wait halo is a game series, could have sworn is some new fangled books series"

523510,hope this guy can still get his rewards
523516,"considering their amazingly organized code, i'm sure this would be easy to implement and wouldn't cause half the champions to be disabled."
523524,it's awesome as it is what are you on about
523525,well sports games are finally getting edgy it looks like...
523528,i would release this on early access
523554,might as well play out all the maps in the map pool to eliminate map randomness
523604,"yea that's one word for it, innovative."
523606,"no, garrisons require me to spend all my time in them."
523614,y i wonder what fnatic thinks i bet they enjoy every moment of being hated by the community
523636,i think people with elite builds are shit because they can;t afford a better ak skin.
523657,yeah but then developers/publishers would actually have to try to make a good game
523664,"play w/ me and boost me to dmg pls, senpai"
523682,he would still have to click the confirmation box they added in 6.1 to prevent accidental kicks/quits.
523683,i prefer 10 minute dubstep breaks.
523698,no man she just clicks q and they die her q scales with 1000% ad
523723,new players just gotta get gud son!
523726,that's because lucian is black and according to the police all black people are armed

523776,because the person who made this is 12 years old?
523793,"yeah, get the ***real*** version already, you pleb."
523831,"don't know what you are talking about, having your top spam ping you the whole game after dying lvl 1 really helps you with your decision making"
523877,as if we're ever going to get laid.
523878,"but i am important too and should be able to post it, fuck you"
523953,"now he's going to grow up and be mass murder, great."
523972,not to mention it's the biggest oddsway sub.
524007,"sure, they go to a lan to half ass it."
524012,"it means there's 4 people at b, it's a forsen stream inside joke that went viral"
524013,but the gap is closer every damn year
524043,hey im gold 5 i know what im talking about dont talk to me like that!
524049,if only people played hostage...
524050,well i think it's *obvious* that michael bay should direct most of the nintendo movies.
524061,"yeah sure ekko was confirmed, but people are overlooking the urgod visual update tease"
524072,jdm spits hi sens in half and tadah pro
524079,this game is fucken un-playable
524132,"yeah, it totally is considering how the game is already out and all."
524165,"ikr, i'm in bronze and i can pull this shit every game ezpz"
524235,are you trying to tell me that the reddit team isn't a serious team that will take the lcs by storm?
524259,"weird, i guess the guitar controller forces you to have a maxed out mic boost."
524269,now he can watch it with ex-ibp
524270,viewmodel is the reason why you lost m8
524276,cause *clearly* they're playing na teams in the eu lcs split
524294,yeah riots bugsplats are certainly all our faults.
524375,hopefully for free cous fuck paid mods
524977,"speaking of vincent, we can only hope one of the unique experiences will be a remade version of his shooting game!"
525030,"yea, this boycott will totally work, like the hundreds of attempts before it"
525125,that's why we have sandbox mode
525365,"well i guess that makes sense, rito has to make money some way"
525787,"no, he should've come to clg to carry even worse players like xmithie, huhi and zionspartan..."
525839,"i agree the r8 is a great gun, they sohuld nerf the chickens"
526185,moe cheating obviously makes him a terrible person who should be exiled from the scene and universally hated
526363,i can make a video without sound :) would that be a gif
526382,i am pretty sure froggen plays tetris aswell
526420,"yeah, wildcard players getting rekt by faker, bjerg and westdoor seems super fun and fair and really enjoyable to watch"
526473,you're getting downvoted because you forgot to put that they're *literally* worse than hitler.
526485,"it's free, what could go wrong?"
526616,i see the rng was in your favor
526628,"nope, consumers definitely know much more about the manufacturing process than the manufacturers."
526638,"to keep all their glorious exclusives, why else?"
526691,literally every object in the game is a weapon if you left click with it
526710,but if they make it *just* like wrath *all* the players will come back.
526791,the play doesn't count because he had two kills
526833,apparently :\^) is not a good substitute for
527187,"no because that will increase queue times and no one will play with trolls, which will make it easier for riot to identify toxic players."
527311,this compliments the other few posts about it very well
527445,i bet all my skins that you are the first person with that problem and you can't find a single answer by using the search function.
527585,"i must be playing a different witcher 3 then, or maybe this console that says ps4 isn't actually a ps4?"
527689,"you can still play offline, just not on valve servers"
527712,"now remember every shitty ori that used her ult across the map, shielded herself, and never landed a single q. vote for bard!"
527779,"'cause there's nothing worse than people thinking you might be gay, right?"
527869,"thank you for this clever question, you just negated all my arguments"
527887,because riot needs to help underdeveloped korean scene.
528012,yeah i mean you'd think they'd be able to get 20gb of code perfect!
528056,obviously blizzard should program a super advanced ai to monitor every single group and determine who really deserves the vote kick and when.
528073,"yeah, because we all remember how people hated cs 1.6, so they needed to lower the skill ceiling, amirite"
528103,yeah just look what happened in china
528136,the chat log is almost always in your email that's sent out by riot after getting the punishment.
528146,getting a piece of hardware you'll never see once its in your computer signed
528196,"look at my garrison from the air, and still be disappointed in it."
528259,they need to save time and because valve wants a bo1
528410,i am 100% salt at this absolutely correct statement
528429,it's just 800 true dmg from his r. nothing special at all!
528525,malz has counter play you just buy a 1250 item to remove his ult and if you are an ap champ you just wasted 1250 for no end build
528531,"first xwx, now rush is boosting?"
528549,but it's not possible because of the venue and time constraints?
528560,"and na midlaners are better than kr midlaners, hotshotgg is a better leblanc than him, and the reason why he was undefeated on leblanc has nothing to do with his personal skill level, but the fact that she is op."
528598,"that's discrimination against ugly people, everyone's face is beautiful in their own special way."
528599,don't do the whole putting him in a prison thing and _just_ murder his entire village
528611,then riot can make a new item called prilosec so that it has counterplay
528633,an asian with glasses he looks just like doublelift
528669,yup if only it hadn't looked so gross they would be fine
528738,"omg, apple revolutionized something else!!!"
528769,"oh yeah and team fortress 2 also got multiple redesigns, and that turned out to be the worst game ever"
528772,omg how will i cope without any new xbox 360 massager games!
528819,"well that's a given, all smurfs are."
528845,i guess his behaviour is ok because he's wealthy!
528851,im global but i always have these insanely good 40hours smurfs
528972,yes the ip do.uthinkwearefo.ols:24507
528984,well they needed to focus on the success that is wildstar...
528989,"wow, this guy seems really trustworthy"
529029,not what i asked but thank you for telling me what i already was well aware of
529030,dude... i've got only one word for you:
529078,this champion was totally not inspired by it
529164,can't wait for the this thing won't load posts from people who didn't read
529169,what else am i gonna use to swallow my adderall?
529177,back when it was a mode i never had to wait for more than 5 sec in queue... but yeah it wasn't so popular
529236,"i mean, you could just get the fade.."
529262,are you seriously gonna download another map when you have plenty already ?
529269,cause this happens like daily...
529295,because ssw was clearly the underdog
529350,"omg, maybe you should stop cheating you mug?"
529384,oh boy i can't wait to see how they'll make caitlyn extremely broken now.
529387,hi im fnatic's manager pls take this down
529396,"yea, because the sound team at riot working on this is so critical to champion balance."
529410,"you named 1 position where og is better than clg while completely ignoring all toher 4 positions, yeah, reasonable opinion right there"
529505,"always play deagle and aim at the head, problem solved"
529542,are you sure your body isn't blocking the flash?
529559,"never knew you could drop shot on this game, this is life changing"
529594,no they're being used for 128 tick servers in source 2
529629,what part of 26 languages do you not understand
529635,gerrymandering win/loss records
529781,i can't wait for them to simulate a twitchy eyelid.
529823,hard to control vision with bugged wards
529858,"i might be alone here, but i think there is too much hype for this game."
529871,because he got it from alliance admiral and definitely not dropped it from some horde npc.
529880,where is motar when we need him
529887,you're the only one with this problem
529924,"nuh uh, op just likes to suck lots of dick and he's a liar!"
529927,because mid laners don't pick tp these days.
530000,"well, at least they've got you around to treat them with some dignity."
530015,"yeah, playing jungle and support on s3 was truly a fun, entertaining experience."
530047,"ye you're right he got really lucky, 4 lucky shots in a row what are the odds"
530070,"you're wrong, it's for youtubers making videos about new skins and champions."
530074,yeah seeing retard in every game is much better!
530109,don't tell me to not to you what you find fulfilling
530158,someone said he cheated with him thats pretty good evidence.
530194,dude obviously the coaches would bjerg level in coaching
530224,obese people's downfall are their genes!
530229,"you didn't need to explain that, couldn't be anything but g sustained."
530270,you're gonna get far in life with that attitude.
530275,well it's a good thing tpp is gonna stop this!
530325,clearly the deagle needs to be nerfed
530356,he is biased for anivia tho... it's because of his 100% win rate on lcs with her i think...
530364,yeah losing worst support in lck must be hard for kt fans
530410,"he's not obnoxious enough without it, duh."
530439,or spunj is hacking and trying to divert any suspicions.
530475,"yeah people who dedicate enough time for a full time job do it because they like working for free, not because of the money usually."
530487,it's your fault for not ganking
530522,"lol the dude was making sure his smudges wouldn't ruin his piece, what a tryhard"
530525,"wow, really good idea skitsnackare, because linux is really good for people who don't know how to use computers and his parents will be really happy with a new os!"
530549,~$566 usd for those of us who use freedom currency
530600,1440x1080 = pasha player models
530622,what a great sample size you represent
530666,dude i totally wanted stickers.
530686,inb4 they get upset in groups and don't even make it out
530711,"yeah, someone has a different opinion as me, i have to try to insult him because i'm the only one who is allowed to be right."
530750,yeah smeb is a shitter in korea while marin is definitely best top laner
530756,yea must be really satisfying to hit lvl 99/ 200 mill xp
530786,he is a player that mouse lifts when you really need him to.
530797,the team that lost 16-5 to conquest was surely going to win this one
530798,"let's just call it soccer, where 5 countries total in the world call it that and a majority call it futbol."
530834,at this rate everyone will have dlore
530840,he looks like he is in one direction and hasn't hit puberty.
530851,looks like his trigger bot glitched
530867,"no, we can't have fun things in halo."
530871,its not like people bought them 80% of the time anyway
530874,"what is this, pussy-ass baby nap time?"
530897,"when thorin does it's banter, but if freak does it he's just a salty loser."
530910,obviously just salty cause fnatic are losing their game.
530957,i wonder why he would have that bias
530960,"im sure bjerg isnt being paid big bucks at all, and is being treated very poorly, good thing chris look out for him so much!"
531006,"nice try, but you aren't fooling me."
531092,cause everyone that's better than me is hacking.
531103,because fnatic is a very tactical team
531108,"holy shit its the second coming of christ, you deserve a medal because i totally care what you have to say"
531145,his reddit badge if proof enough
531150,are they going to continue being condescending towards their player base...that was really cool...
531153,"need a diamond one too, we're close enough to cod now anyway"
531178,wow this definitely wasn't staged for karma at all.
531179,"you just need his email address to hack him, right?"
531243,"good thing mods are removing the posts, so nobody actually knows if it is a serverside problem or an intern one."
531245,they obviously stole it from black mesa
531283,yeah boy it would be confusing things not doing the correct damage in pvp with no indication that it has pvp stats or an item with increased resilience without it showing in the tool tip
531286,i bet the xbox one version of god of war 3 blows even the ps4 version out of the water!
531368,"yeah, because a player who is global elite really needs to watch videos of how to hold a b rush"
531411,nah man but they weren't in 0.0.1 hipstercraft so they're not old
531417,"well duh, upgrading your trinket doesn't give damage!"
531420,"yeah, because the community is one person."
531442,not part of 'murica therefore doesn't matter.
531459,"a clg fan, not sure if you would have ever heard of playoffs without being a fnatic fan too"
531472,but he has a phd in psychology and knows how to behave better than us so we should listen to him for he is holier than us and therefore knows what's best for us.
531473,"he's right, the upvotes and downvotes have spoken."
531474,"yeah, because we need more posts about misaligned things in csgo."
531484,"... ehrrm, as opposed to those non-permanent vac bans out there?"
531486,"iwata, kojima, what's the difference?"
531509,teach us to be cool like you are!
531514,"ya, that would look real great for riot."
531515,all the best eastern moba players clearly are playing league whereas the best westerners are playing dota.
531543,yeah but while riot has the players backs he could have just told them.
531546,ask freak about his workout routine
531549,"no :) you deserved to be banned, no more fun mate !"
531552,you should tell this to incarnati0n.
531566,oh my god riot is making sure they fixed the problem how horrible of them
531568,well good thing i bought it from g2a
531569,"literally no one, glad to see they are spending time selling overpriced hoodies rather than fixing their broken game"
531595,"okay devilwalk well just sv_cheat only enable +jump and -attack, problem solved"
531609,"cod, cod 2, cod 3, cod mw, cod mw2, cod mw3 (best goty imo), cod waw, cod bo, cod bo 2, cod aw."
531628,a close range p250 is obv stronger than an m4
531644,i bet the pros are so tired of winning all that money!
531676,well it's a good thing zeus took time out his pro career to drop by silver games and point it out to them
531696,"as a 25 year old, he doesn't represent all of us."
531707,"i'm sure that would account for most guys' verbal abuse, yes."
531743,those are trophies you filthy casual
531759,"as someone who hasn't seen this before, thanks."
531771,bamboo shoot haha i'm so witty
531780,til: 2 out of 10 na lcs players are american
531820,but mobile gameing is the future!
531859,"it's in the code because if it wasn't, people would kick players for the far superior bots."
531864,tryndamere flair and complain about not enough sustain
531868,maybe it's part of the replay system update!
531919,"wow, such a challenging and mechanical champion"
531983,"yes, because the matchmaking system is 100% flawless and everybody is the exact same skill as you."
531986,the greatest team off all time for winning a single tournament
531987,which is why they never been a finalist in the highest competitive tournament clearly they are the best team off all time
532000,"no, anything should only ever be shown once on the internet!"
532016,"than we shall keep her in the state she's currently in, hoorah!"
532116,yeah let's pretend the first mym scandal would have gotten the same attention and public response if it had been banned from the subreddit
532127,wait is this the satire news network for cs:go?
532149,so youre telling me i cant cross los angeles in ten minutes on the biggest freeways?
532171,team siren this is your chance!
532194,"nah, i think i'd rather go for the official xbox branded 2 tb drive for $130."
532199,"things that actually happened, in real life, things that should make players uncomfortable = preaching we must pretend they never happened to make them feel better don't you see?"
532200,everyone knows that you have to play a whole baseball game to train your throw
532207,yeah just give trick a few dollars and send him a message!
532231,but that one is green and says x-box on it!
532235,i love the path of the titans feature
532278,yh i mean did u see tsm vs dig that shit was way better than eu games.
532297,"but wow is dead they lost so many subs, blizzard sucks."
532311,no this is ak ranks where literally everyone is a cheater
532333,"i love watching chess, it's so dynamic and there is so much action"
532354,paying for backwards compatibility is great
532359,"awesome, we can get the insignia now!"
532379,wrathion wants it and will be making demon dragons!
532412,"right, because a review on the available content on the first day will be reflective of our experience forever."
532418,"well, but the only reason these little genuis kids aren't global, is because of shit team mates and cheater -,-"
532423,the only reason i play cs is to win so i can trash talk the other team.
532448,buy it so you get better at the game
532460,"vac plz, that was obvious cheating from the awper."
532482,kennys souvenirs wouldn't even be rare because he always gets mvp
532498,plus he can totally beat majin buu
532509,oh i do love those me-mes as the kids say or maymays as some might say
532522,yeah... so colourful with all 2 colours... blue and white... man does are some silly colour choices.

532535,"sorry, forgot the very important"
532578,"yeah, because i chant clg just for fun."
532583,when you see the p250 sand dune
532610,if he's lagging that much why cc him?
532636,wow nobody has ever posted that before in this thread
532641,u mad cuz amerifat and fagitzoid just got rekt by papa biceps
532645,omg tipical udyr player so toxic
532682,"i mean, it's not like riot is going to tone them all down before 5.18 or anything..."
532686,yes fking hitler didnt teach them respect german shitheads
532691,yeah the random bro dudes shouting and tsm chants will be amazing
532697,pls give the casters a desk at worlds never knew desks were made to sit on
532769,because the majority of them are french?
532786,"wow, i've never seen this before either!"
532800,"yeah, why don't people just choose to not have horrible infrastructure in places like socal?"
532802,idk what you're talking about that 10% crit chance wins lane for me every time.
532828,yeah...we all know how many men would turn down suzy and taylor swift
532836,because that's going to make for such an engaging viewing experience...
532843,wow it's almost like there's strategy to this game
532919,ask him if he could teach you some skills you scrub
532949,and they say one player can't carry
532994,i guess faker is the only good midlaner in the east.
533071,"yeah, let akali proc spellvamp every 1 second.. that sounds good"
533079,boktai- the sun is in your hand!
533083,if only they could be well-informed unique snowflakes like ourselves.
533088,"wow, a blue c9 zac with just a white 9 on the belly, we absolutely need it ..."
533092,"i to, like judging teams that just recently changed their roster."
533103,yeah i like stories where no characters die and everyone lives happily ever after
533109,i made my skype group upvote this!
533140,"yeah, investing in exclusives for the smaller market is an excellent idea."
533158,"you, sir, are the kind of players that are called satanists"
533165,"holy shit, can i get the vod when it's finished?"
533191,those next gen consoles are really something aren't they!
533197,is hiko the equivalent of flickshotting now?
533207,clearly he was being serious and stop talking after saying that.
533269,why not both so warrior junglers are spammed in every game again
533293,most likely scenario: building up a list of stickers or music kits.
533298,"yeah, i'm glad they delayed watch_dogs and took the time to fix all the bugs and make it a great game, this game will surely be the same"
533305,*rango's burst is balanced just buy pink wards you noobs*
533314,"oh, i forgot that the possessions of dead people must be retained forever"
533323,tryndamere getting visually updated?
533352,"b-but, people might confuse the flying blade-wielding kitty with a cow!"
533357,til chanting 3 letters is a reference to league
533367,"after spelling your own name wrong in a note to **the president of the united states of america** yes, you're recognizable."
533372,i noticed it right away... i mean that sense is way too low for a silver
533415,yeah cause all they do is make games
533428,at least we sort of have lg and vaco.
533442,because obviously all there is to support a team is to be active on social media and tweet about upcoming streams and matches
533461,"i dunno, this might hurt pachinko sales."
533496,what ksp visual mods are you using?
533498,divide up the country in half and announce political segregation
533499,people would rage at each other for picking a champion with +x.xx attack/level when they had better option thus introducing more toxicity.
533511,yayyy more remastered old games
534474,toplaner feeding because no vision in the bottom half of the map
534863,paid weapon upgrades confirmed.
534988,spoiler: [but tirion dies in the paladin's artifact quest]
535215,$50 season pass now totally worth it
535377,and shiny with one of each gender if applicable
535385,yea sure froggen and bjerg don't make cool plays and mechanics
535410,because shroud is the first one in the entire world to name it this
535456,dat silver crosshair placement though... maybe aim more to the ground next time and you will reach global
535463,riot probably doesn't know how to code this
535630,ya man im runnin round dust with mah glock yo
535808,shouldn't have wasted flash on that noob heca which was outplaying himself and flash that can't ultimate ofc.
535840,"dont forget the ibp ban threads too, they are super fun."
535871,but... but... reddit told me riot wanted to destroy ogn and kr lol
535923,yea but at least all the mg1's can get to global now that pesky spray has been reverted.
535942,because its not like you cant delete -rep comments or anything
536026,because kojima is the greatest video game dev to ever exist y'know
536049,"yes, people who botted to level up a character deserve the same punishment as people fly hacking in arenas!"
536074,"you're right, there are only 4 fpss!"
536099,thanks esea for the promotion..
536194,this makes so much sense it blew my mind
536243,lel csgo devs are noobs confirmed
536253,"hey guys, look at the master ballsmith over here."
536362,that wouldn't have been disappointing.
536540,"hold on, let me queue up a smurf"
536541,"he was walling and knew the guy was there with 1 hp, obviously"
536634,dont choke on the qualifying matches?
536635,my ukrainian mom also texts me in english
536722,your username just perfectly describes the content of the video.
536729,well jews don't celebrate christmas so it cant be real.
536762,"you don't need smokes for ct side, you'll probably win regardless."
536782,"please, why are you acting like doctor who is subjective?"
536989,wow 10/10 post m8 super funny almost pooped my pants.
537120,obviously the guy was a pro cs player smurfing in global
537124,"true, because riot has never before acted on anything after an issue got attention on reddit."
537153,good thing there are no more chores in the game.
537209,is it cheaper than the ones you buy from market
537234,only because they took away his heal.
537248,"oh boy i can't wait to see bang, imp, rekkles, and doublelift outplay their opponents with insane morde skills"
537310,yea cause spamming this will really help!
537314,"oh come on, they are just smurfing at global."
537360,why is warowl more relevant then moe?
537376,but you can get to your garrison buildings so much faster!
537467,hey it is annoying that is why flusha uses it!
537476,that isn't dinnerbone's true identity... he isn't upside down!
537500,"yeah, but do you know who meepo is?"
537568,yeah but his opponent must of been an idoit that didn't know how to bait his q or didn't back off for his passive to run out in fights
537593,keep you dirty plebs out of our ranked games
537662,we couldn't stop laughing about it so it never got removed
537713,after 3 minutes of checking your past comments; yeah you're totally not toxic.
537729,i did a running spray with a nagev against shroud back when we were silvers
537730,i think i should hack now for a bit to improve game sense
537744,"all those recent rework failures like darius, garen, scarner, fiora"
537761,because on supreme ak's don't oneshot against helmet
537791,but still somehow totally unnoticed
537821,because we all know lux is the most mobile champion in the game
537935,yea thats why people who don't get their one-trick-pony-champ can still perform adequately at w/e mmr the game is at!
537949,well someone has to work on those music kits...
537952,well that response was retarded
538047,care to share how you know this?
538054,my favorite pc gaming option is deciding which porn mod to use.
538089,but date your boss and don't die a virgin were good!
538112,don't forget dosing ;) ddosing and dosing are two different things.
538130,she cant 1 shot entire minion wave in a single 1300 range large aoe spell shes trash
538157,"make his q work only if there are no allies nearby, so he cant abuse having a support anymore"
538179,"1) it was the kind of generalization that was general (generally most generalizations tend to be general) 2) i'm no-one in particular i just decided to write something 3) i didn't intend to contribute anything significant 4) it wasn't an 'ill-thought' comment, i thought deeply - very deeply - about this comment"
538202,"i'm in diamond, so i can sub in right?"
538230,febiven dropping the disrespect on faker confirmed
538262,a champion with a 3-stack mechanic
538316,yeah because they're going to kill off the a1 when the next case will come with a covert m4a1-s skin.
538348,"if they're the strongest teams, why didn't they make it to worlds?"
538369,"guys, soloqueue means nothing stop harassing balls."
538380,maybe this is intentional to make the skill cap higher
538382,"finally a good cause, not that extra life bullshit..."
538426,maybe nip will pick them up once their current players contracts end
538428,yup and tsm will not only get out of group but win worlds too :d
538436,yeah they should change it so that it waits to put you in a game just starting!
538439,riot's tsm favoritism is shining
538458,separates the good people with timers from the great people with timers
538515,richard lewis is such an asshole
538563,"meh lp doesn't matter just dodge all the way to bronze 5 and try to climb it again, you will see how easy it is since ur mmr is the same"
538598,im sure c9 were using all their strats against them
538629,"this is why taric hasn't been reworked yet, a riot guy mains him and doesn't want to lose his favourite champion"
538645,nah man she once posted a photo with like 2% cleavage of the average oh yea
538649,"yes, they read every single bliz plz post."
538651,dyrus would know bjerg cant solo carry tsm anymore :^)
538725,yep it's just as simple as hopping on a boat and sneaking off of it in southampton.
538856,"don't worry dude there at riot games^^^tm they do nothing like no other, this is why they're the best company ever"
538857,"but if you use the mute button your brain has already been damaged ziiaaac, i'm so sorry for you now you're gonna need a phd in psychology to understand how to come back from such brain injury"
538864,white and gold is a weird colour combination for a championship skin.
538865,"m0e, flusha, olof, krimz, pronax."
538875,"dude, just dodge the spell and veigar is ez!"
538954,"i don't think you understand this game, all we care about is skins and stickers but mainly music packs"
539027,tony hawk pro skater 5 is exactly that!
539081,thorin sucks bla stupid comments bla idiot bla
539125,"i know right, like almost every other collectibles."
539130,valve implemented this intentionally so that you would knife him to get $1500 instead of $300.
539131,literally worst organization ever
539167,"no, blame underage betting and gambling sites."
539202,because c9 has shown that this is the only style they can play.
539204,"your so impatient, it's only been three years since they announced a western release and promptly acted like they never said anything at all."
539220,you see it's all about strategy and movement.
539317,"they played realy good today, they will beat og im sure."
539336,"hearthstone, overwatch and wow confirmed for consoles."
539343,"damn, that's only 1 thousand times less than the actual game!"
539419,either leduck or coach mvp of na lcs... please be ledank
539433,yeah you are so good you rekt those mgs.. obligatory
539468,but how did you discuss the strats?
539495,nono it's because we're all misogynists and hate all women!
539505,obviously the aussie who checked the broadcast schedule and said it is
539568,what he is actually saying is lck deserves 10 seeds.
539571,"no, rank 1 is obviously better than bang"
539750,but then people will flame that teammates aren't spending their gold or buying wards or w/e
539753,but it has to be 100% conclusive
539770,"man clearlove is just a legacy player, why not put in tbq or world 6"
539789,"well, he doesn't play tryndamere mid."
539792,buy 3 more and line them up 2x2
539793,ritos fault for not having soundproof rooms for teams
539816,he is just winning that much because he is playing with at least 3 europeans in his team
539822,"free win for origen, faker just doesn't want to tarnish himself."
539838,all that destruction and no cloud in sight how is this possible?
539878,"good idea, if they implement this i can now always mute the stream and just watch"
539893,lol women in a fighting game amirite?
539908,"but dude monte just rides korean dick for no good reason, so biased"
539909,you were kicked because your teammates were russian
539913,"can cofirm aswell, cheats got me to global and i am german, too!"
539965,"yeah, if you look at all the top supports in the lcs or even in general they all have high wave clear."
539976,yep because towley and lirik are the only 2 people streaming overwatch right now
539977,did you check if your scripts were on?
540012,i love playing port mackerel 47 times in a rotation and kelp dome twice.
540035,it's nintendo's fault for a lack of 3rd party support obviously.
540039,because false reports are currently a huge problem in the post game lobby right?
540040,what about spirit of the ancient lizard?
540067,im sure riot intentions are producing completly broken champs and they never thought about changing a champ to be balanced... right ?
540081,"nah man, kda is obviously all that counts."
540104,sony are trying to make xbox ones not work as intended on their tvs *twilight zone*
540126,"well yeah, but when she does it, it's a problem, *obviously*"
540152,i thought pc gamers only pirated their games though?
540193,"if it really wants to fill a void, they would add zombies to their post-apocalyptic game"
540216,"shit you are right, i can't use my w to secure safety because otherwise the tower will be left with 1k more health than if i didn't use that one soldier!"
540233,and reddit definitely would never try and self destruct itself...
540246,do they use that car to go back home after losing at lan?
540318,"gee, i sure wonder how such few realms have so many people, compared to live wow has so many realms but too little people!"
540327,"unpause while olof is gone, ez 3-0 for c9"
540355,i hate that everyone picks flash
540409,see guys anyone can do it anytime i told you frankie is legit.
540442,i bet they will have better internet than sweden.
540467,"tickrate is 32 for demos now, so you should be good."
540474,ugh but my team mates suck even when i tell them to stop feeding like stupid bronze kiddies!
540503,ptr drinking a root beer since he isn't old enough to have a regular beer.
540514,its like saying kqly doesnt deserve to play because he fucked up once
540521,"that's a major patch right there, gonna take a lot of work!"
540529,no one cares that you are in d2.
540537,"enjoy your fbi interrogation, trying to explain this as a joke."
540559,"yeah, they talk trash to each other in all chat all the time."
540582,"absolutely not, everyone must conform to my opinions!"
540632,i don't care if ur cheating :d its entertaining for us and thats all that matters :d we still support you frankie :d
540642,"i always prefire that spot, every game every round"
540660,are you calling flusha a rage hacker?
540662,no way this guys gay; look how homophobic he is.
540689,no clearly the drugs are ruining their lives
540726,"sure, all they care about is worldth!"
540741,"you could just buy it again, because you know , eventually you're gonna run out of storage..."
540751,oh dude of course i put my heart and soul into this
540762,"yeah, because that makes sense."
540767,the keyboard probably didn't inject his dll properly
540801,"the lem icon is so sexy, it's the only reason i'm not supreme yet"
540803,but it will cost you a raid tier
540806,"that isn't a game though, it's a work of art!"
540819,yea i know... i was just writing it like that ... cause you know... 4chan tly :3
540826,"then don't take the towers and listen to propaganda, easy fix."
540831,probably using their coaches wall hack residue to get their info
540844,obviously your moving threw your shot off and made you miss from point blank range.
540858,"you're right, the alert in the hud isn't nearly clear enough."
540881,"yeah, remember swatting on n0thing?"
540897,"i think they are sleeper op, you just have to aim for the legs."
540909,not very well... how do you function in the real world?
540912,"screw you man, i'll never forgive you for this"
540913,how do u die 10 times on ryze scrub confirmed
540945,because the artists are the programmers and the lap sitting took 1 million years to program.
540979,how can s1mple play with cyberfocus if they are the same person?
541026,i'd be challenger if i had a challenger level player to carry me there...
541065,they stopped taking adderall and are coming down hard.
541157,"massive farm dude, like 10 aram games is way too much, getting all the icons for the shurima event was so much easier"
541189,"best team comp: morgana, rengar, veigar, ashe and garen"
541220,"windows 10 were too strong, so it broke his gpu in two..."
541227,"yeah, that clearly works really well."
541279,coz it's easier to get the lighting in your screenshot when the game plays at 2fps
541305,"yeah, my dad works for riot and can also confirm, thats is a bot."
541306,yeah because the whole world is in school now
541349,flying in draenor will bring them back!
541379,"no you're wrong, minecraft is perfect."
541415,"from reading these comments from salty west coast players, 80 is definitely enough to make the game unplayable!"
541426,were you not hugged as a child?
541430,"it's an eagle spear, it clearly flies"
541452,i didn't know integrated graphics cards were called mods now.
541457,"hey, deciding when to click the r button is what separated the good fioras from the great fioras!"
541465,good thing they disabled him after the rework so bugs can't surface before playoffs.
541518,so you've just watched two episodes?
541521,waow so many in proportion to all the pros out there!
541548,"don't you get it, you can't be gay unless you're a prissy little nancy-boy."
541583,it clearly says fiend shit ... get your facts straight bro
541586,"wow, nice argument completely relevant to both of our previous comments."
541604,they can't do that with all the tech debt they have accumulated.
541635,"great idea, we should have you running riot studios"
541655,"yeah, with some kind of 3-hit passive"
541664,"oh, i forgot you could fly in raids."
541693,he probably just has $5k headphones.
541723,because it takes more than a lunch break to write a couple lines of code
541724,because this is totally a power ranking and not a for fun elo comparison
541764,"yeah, bhopping totally isn't useful in any situation ever"
541765,"while we're at it we should give the ak a scope too, and 100% accuracy when spraying."
541802,since na west coast ping gets worse they must compensate it on euw.
541811,just cuz he got vac banned doesn't mean he's a cheater
541841,haha while you're at it add kill streaks and rpgs!
541876,"no he's obviously cheating, see i'm eagle and i know if a pro is cheating."
541883,maybe his body just need that adderall afterall?
541930,"yeah, they looked awful compared to that high skill matchup between uol and h2k earlier."
541980,"shh don't tell the pvpers, they'll expect real content or something"
542004,"because having a 2k+ health ally in the form of dragon, for no particular reason, doesn't count as an advantage when seigeing towers."
542021,i'm diamond too but it's pretty hard to carry as adc in silver without another smurf
542058,"just take flash/cleanse, that's clear counterplay right there"
542065,obviously because the servers moved from chicago to new york.
542067,which means he's a liar and just recorded nasty ps4 footage
542103,"na man, adc is totally fine right now just kite lawl"
542118,"he was right, it gives you no damage."
542120,she sure is dating him for his personality and looks.
542121,"yeah i guess, useless gaming armor + useless arrow."
542135,they are just hiding and preparing the source 2 launch at pax like that one guy said
542143,we already got the shitty smgs and pistols
542147,but they are continuations of established game series and not nearly as good as the remakes and sequels on ps4 and xbone
542169,kill your xbox or playstation wii-like gaming capabilities because everyone knows the wii is the best selling console of all time
542189,because clg has never had confidence issues especially when the games really matter.
542207,"you're right, i cant understand any of the words when its used!"
542238,yea and casters get 1000+ ap late game when i get 5xx ad whats up with that i want my 1000 ad on zed or vayne
542327,just play the game the way its meant to be played and stop hacking
542331,it's ok just pick up your mouse it gives you aimlock
542375,time for some much needed alone time
542378,"no that wouldnt be fair, they probably create a skin set for the 2nd place team."
542397,everything else than coming in last would be a huge disappointment.
542399,ye dyrus should afk and be in fountain
542407,yeah obivously the teams at those international competitions were the best teams in the world
542426,"shouldn't have dropped scream, hs% in titan at a silver level now."
542447,know what since a awp deals damage relatively quickly you should just hold that one out
542451,"don't believe this guy, i just tried and it still didn't work."
542456,noob tube attachments for every gun
542466,but he can pick vayne and then it's like double was there
542477,"yeah cheaters, douchebags, throwers are great - more drama more soul and fun"
542489,should have been at fountain first 10 mins of game obviously
542516,"yes, because pokemon needs to never graphically evolve with the times and just cater directly to 90's kid nostalgia."
542543,well that's the only reason i'm losing every once in awhile!
542593,"yeah, we should also blame cdpr, totally, because it doesn't cost any money, time and manpower to implement another hair physics system."
542595,"oh great, more internet drama to generate clicks."
542603,i thought everyone in this sub reddit was already challenger
542621,"oh man, i love this let's make it a skillshot meme."
542625,you mean 5 people don't get a free skin for 95 rp ($1)?
542639,which explains why swedish people get 5 ping.
542650,get rid of everything and make it a straight line so its even for both teams.
542663,definitely more consistent than jw
542685,oh like giving him mana burn and a silence?
542732,"he obviously tried to destroy the lich king to protect azeroth, not because itserved his purpose"
542735,down voted because idk what you are.
542741,"yes, that isn't a massive oversimplification made by a fanboy at all."
542773,"yeah, why cant people just deal with cancer, right, stop being sad about it"
543419,but.. what about that sweet advertising for a game you already own digitally?
543441,so does this mean steve is coming to smash?
543547,"yeap, just like the sc community did."
543801,i would be top-tier too but its my teammates fault that im bronze 5
543844,"people are getting fucked over but their not me and i don't know them, so i don't give a fuck!"
543972,but european football is midweek
544057,"that's why they shifted ranks, now the formerly gn4 devs are probably like lem, problem solved!"
544113,i'm sure riot sat down and said how are we going to screw eu lcs this season
544141,"but it's *japanese*... that alone should make you ejaculate, right?"
544271,"haven't you heard, they just did!"
544275,"yeah valve, which is who we're talking about here, really fucked payday 2"
544455,"clearly this is a well written and edited article, it's from forbes!"
544603,why is everyone hating on gullius he is a tried and tested player who he has play on the world stage
544628,literally going to kill each other
544744,"yeah, i'm sure that was the reason he won by a clear majority"
544865,yeah morgana's 3.4 ap ratio is so low
544915,with the new rng and the r8 call of duty is a real competitor now.
545054,"obviously a fake, we all know pc gamers are fat nerds who live in their parents basement"
545189,"yea fuck sexuality, it is antifeminism."
545264,it has more movespeed than shiv boom headshot
545284,"wow, it's like they listen to what we want!"
545304,this happens because you penetrate so big amount of fog
545459,and this thread is why germany invaded poland.
545498,"well it's up to us to believe in him, spread his 43 dicks belief and write a religious book about it and it'll become the newer definition of hydra after a period of time according to mythology."
545525,maintenance buffs were awesome gameplay too!
545656,"but valve and gaben can do no wrong, it will be amazin"
545711,"there is no such thing as lucky kills or better players, only hackers."
545751,"meh, eu imports are not a big deal, for c9 it was incarnation or goldenglue, basically the same players"
545756,kasing being passed around like the town whore.
545757,"what, you don't like $60 game + $60 season pass for a multiplayer only game with minimal game modes and replayability without getting bored?"
545796,"you just gotta commit, max e and go runeglaive"
545820,everything after cod4 was a step in the wrong direction
545851,yes because the 1st thing i do when i break electricals is take it to my wine specialist.
545946,the loss of the mana potion was indeed devastating
545988,change title to cod looking cache because it actually looks like it came from a cod trailer or something (with cs player models of course)
546042,wow you're obviously trying to show off your skins
546043,"i know, i expect at least 51g 52s and 53 cp, amirite?"
546068,they don't even try with these easter eggs anymore.
546082,maybe they're removing his cigar
546102,lol yeah dude it's anxiety just believe...
546145,wait this isnt na fpl *downvotes*
546263,"yeah, always the fucking globals"
546303,this is called a d i c t i o n
546449,it's like you were losing money if you didn't spend atleast 100 dollars
546500,can't wait for a 10k 120fps tv!
546600,nah man global didn't get worse after the vac waves
546636,oh good cait trap buffs mean that the 20 minute period during which she does jack shit is solved now.
546670,"absolutely nothing, but it is a negative tech term and thus is applies"
546731,that 2-key rollover great for gaming!
546834,"top - darshann he soloed everyone in na and flame jg- xmithies best aim world literally a sniper with those skill shots mid-y u n g p o b - beat bjergsen(the previous best at mid in the world)in lane 3 times in a row thus making him the best mid adc - doublelift best adc, best mechanics, best autospacing support - aphromoo - the moo"
546890,i dunno man i landed this sick noscope versus mgs just yesterday
546932,"yep, you never see anyone with a gold border in silver or in normals."
546949,bro i'm finally out of bronze now
546982,"yea, i can't wait for ~~minecraft 2.0~~ version 2 flat since that clearly comes after 1.9 because it goes by decimal values and that is exactly how it goes and stuff."
547088,you people are so edgy and funny!
547161,"oh no, rammus auto deals +15 damage, whatever will i do as a slippery fish"
547203,my teammates got carried obviously
547234,poor dude who completely deserved his ban.
547333,"brain checks out, always trust the internet when they say they are silver 1"
547353,nah the best part of being a worgen is when you race change to tauren.
547456,"wow, you have really put a lot of effort into this"
547468,"if i can uninstall it, will it take the edge off?"
547481,and of course he's made no improvement in play in the several months it's been since then.
547482,tf rework to have spider solitaire passive?
547518,but ... the game would be perfectly balanced and the toxicity gone !
547631,"yes dude, better put a hard doublelift penta!"
547638,why don't you just win the custom then ?
547658,"i don't like sivir spell shield either, let's remove it."
547749,i agree lets bring back the meta where only 5 guns in the game are useful
547751,strange that an official frozen game would be such a mediocer port
547766,your neeks bruv hahaha lowe it you pagans.
547772,he also made a series of games called dark souls
547783,what are you talking about adcs are so weak and useless and can't win games in this meta.
547805,"yeah man a 5v5 team game should be way more focused on individuality, just like any other team sport!"
547818,yeah because you totally cant be good at this game without mech
547858,90% of the players are people idling for shadow cases
547870,"cause no one on gears uses mics, duh"
547887,"lol they're a higher rank than me, guess it's because they don't surrender!"
547911,but before the 7 are over it's 1v2.
547930,"yeah, my favourite food is pepperoni pizza, but i've never eaten it."
547965,nah you're just a pro team stalker
548034,as opposed to the oculus facebook experience?
548048,didnt know cyanide can bring in a celebrity guest for his videos
548084,"oh come on, those aren't even 360 no scopes...casual."
548135,then buy different controllers.
548217,"yep, *sivir comps* have nothing to do with sivir and just the heroes around her."
548218,if you like someone mining in your pc is better to play minecraft
548243,ahh the side of the community that makes it what it is.
548260,"what are you saying, sbenu vs im games were always such high quality matches."
548418,this wouldn't happen with a 144/hz monitor
548443,no way dude it's the end of the world we are half way into group stages get real
548463,why not just undo the french shuffle and use titan?
548478,but adcs are only picked because of their utility these days
548486,"we lost, but we were the strongest, obviously"
548522,"no, natosaphix and daboo are the real top tier casters."
548610,yeah definitively specially in korea in asia where drugs is extremly not well viewed
548615,haha or saying some really bad word like.. i almost can't type it ... fuck
548637,"yea, the game will seem too unrealistic now because of the delorean..."
548655,there was a exploit were greater stealth trinket made people win more by seeing in the fog of war.
548694,"clearly i'm some sort of super human then, considering i can easily spot the difference between 30 and 144 fps when playing league(i have a 144hz monitor)"
548697,"after 1000 auto attacks, thats 3000 damage difference.. thats pretty damn big difference man."
548700,o ye at least i use real guns skurblord
548716,such high quality gaming content
548749,i thought tsm were training for worlds this season though
548770,more exciting than the gta v dlc :o \
548798,sharing secrets betwen each others tabe v2.0
548803,what if skt ff'd at 20 before losing an inner turret?
548805,my post has been submitted almost a year ago using ie.
548817,"he really lacks a dash lol, that'll fix him real good"
548822,i'm sure somebody else wrote the title too.
548925,"myb, i forgot that because i am not pro i cannot criticize pros"
548957,"please, i could do this before i even installed steam"
549013,man singed mains sure are toxic :\^)
549028,"he's just a tall dwarf, you racist fuck."
549033,i mean obviously we can see that you have a massive amount of respect for imp
549043,looks like he hit his aim key to check if anyone was in tuns.
549060,how about using 1:2 resolution?
549106,i guess reddit doesn't like sarcasm.
549144,he doesn't seem to have too much trust in his team.
549166,so what you are essentially saying is this could be bethesda's work?
549224,"that is a bit overkill jesus, maybe their pc's should explode as well"
549293,clg just using all 30 rounds to get some extra practice before the real important matches
549295,it's apparently an unknown feature that no one uses...
549303,they're playing so good ska doesn't even have to move from spawn
549309,less da's and be's but a few more di's
549344,:thumbs_up: clearly you're in the preview program for all the right reasons.
549352,just totally amazes me that someone would spend their time on the internet lying to people!
549355,good to see blizzard is tackling the gold inflation problem.
549365,imaqtpie already explained it why..
549377,which is why balls was stuck in d2.
549399,we all know that everyone in cs:go is a smurfing hacking cheater noob.
549420,cause bitching about things works better then trying to actually do something!
549422,"only 250k $ up for grabs, let's just skip it boysss"
549456,"they should all get a participation medal for playing, so nobody feels like a loser."
549511,"i think nazis did nothing wrong, cuz hitler brought the plans to their minds."
549523,"yes lol.. he has the newest aimbot that aims just in front of the enemy and then around him, to make it less obvious."
549527,"but they need to make a gui in bios to do that, its too risky."
549531,yeah and it's literally impossible for clg to make an offer that jack would accept.
549643,oh man you got him so good you are the king of burns
549649,i am sure the circlejerk is totally worthy of determining that.
549729,envyus -happy +ex6tenz top 1 hltv confirmed
549768,lyte confirms euw/eune is a toxic shithole
549832,"oh, you must watch a lot of lpl..."
549840,"i really miss auto-attacking boars in blasted lands for 45 minutes if i wanted to equip a new weapon type, too."
549857,well obviously the champions that he plays are way more important than oriana duh!
549916,"no he could just see where they were due to being in obvious spots, team is just bad against a good player"
549956,"nah, i'm sure that pulling the plug on their only game for 4-6 months wouldn't hurt their playerbase, revenues or their reputation in the slightest."
549968,maybe this will finally make syndra meta again
549970,"but fnatic went 3-2 versus skt so clearly this random ass fnatic fan knows what they're talking about, right?"
549988,"yeah, we'll totally stop getting ea and ubi games, you're so right."
550000,maybe the technology just isn't there yet...
550005,"yeah, who doesn't love getting his ears raped."
550008,shhh yes insightful comment i'm now more knowledgeable as to why the community and you wouldn't want this thank you for your detailed explanation
550015,i don't think the gba is region locked so you should just learn japanese
550020,"yeah, 4 of the team members dying from damage by a single midlaner is not important"
550030,yup not at all he needs a death cap passive instead of the chalice.
550045,wow i bet they never thought of that
550049,not to mention it only sold for just under 24 dollars.
550054,maybe we should set quotas and hire based on gender instead of ability
550061,"because it runs better on ps3 already, no need"
550073,that must be why na is so horrible!
550091,"but then you still have to run through like, 10 whole mobs!"
550115,"i know, 3600 points and 90% upvotes: op is on the floor"
550119,but my view on life really has changed
550160,yes because which videogame gets remastered is a matter of grave importance and popularity shouldn't factor into business decisions.
550171,but who plays games for the story?
550181,wow he cheated in a tournament 9 years ago he sounds like a terrible person.
550231,oh so no one noticed the implied
550240,that's highly unlikely unless you're challenger.
550261,well never knew you could connect the kinect into minecraft...microsoft must have made some big changes under the hood for armor stands..
550273,"the extra information, a few numbers to be exact, could confuse new players and make the game feel too complex."
550308,yeah only mammals have nipples.
550329,"man, he won iem vs world elite, he totally deserves a spot !"
550330,"new ui so tilting, makes me play bad"
550346,-lex +pauf -anger +twist -ptr +schneider top 1 na
550349,needs a knock up and an execute
550361,"because amumu and sej are the same champion with the same abilities, ults and weaknesses"
550376,"if you rearrange them it spells dlc...s. guys the end is near, dlc is coming to minecraft."
550381,"i watched my dad play ut when i was a kid, and i can confirm that im now a psychopath who massmurders people"
550390,"he is totally air strafing, he just uses a really good mouse."
550414,"because obviously the pros have godlike sensitivity-decisions, all other senses except those being used are useless."
550538,"yeah, its probably his intelligence and not a language barrier issue or anything."
550550,almost if there is a lot of different people in here
550552,i like to see those beautiful linus eyes at 4k.
550556,and i was so looking forward to playing this on my dreamcast.
550569,you need to pay valve more money for the high res skins
550572,"disney's cory in the house, duh"
550593,"yeah, we found the boston bomber we can find this kid too!"
550595,feels so great to require an item to be barely functional instead of having a passive that acts as a boon.
550608,"dude, survival game games maps are way bigger"
550626,i for one am so glad we got an event with summoner icons and a disabled gangplank instead of replays and sandbox mode
550653,"yes, 7 dungeons, 2 raids, new class, new continent, 10 levels, class orders and new honor system all patch content..."
550673,dont you know that illidan didnt use crossbows?
550674,because you totally cant see the skin with this viewmodel
550675,yeah it's rude by maniac trying to make a living and a future career after cs
550704,"you just don't understand the subtle genius of nintendo, on this issue."
550705,thought the same ^^ i aren't think dat m8
550709,you sound pretty biased when you say that
550724,no you are literally the only person in the world who feels that way
550730,"dude, but wod is like the most feature rich expansion ever!"
550771,"sure replace one of their best players instead of undoubtedly their worst, great idea"
550778,"why yes lets just wait until its done and its too late to be changed, what a great idea op!"
550795,"oh no i didnt get an icon oh no what a tragedy, i cant use it over my other 50 icons including baron santa, fizz icon, debonair icon, mecha icon, etc"
550843,"or, just buy a lot of keys because there's bound to be a really expensive knife in there somewhere."
550853,"they don't really take ideas from reddit though, remember, they know better."
550878,"yeah, mario kart 8/bayonetta 2/w101 were such *huge* disappointments."
550912,"well duh, it's the save picture!"
550961,"yeah, because everybody was able to get it when it was a gamestop exclusive wii game"
550970,good thing that riot has made crit less rng
550979,"csgo on controller, hardcore gamer confirmed"
550995,he's the kind of awper who plays better with rifles
550996,"yeah man, did you not use it pre-patch?"
550997,"faze and optic are rich af, they'll probably buy fnatic, c9 and tsm."
551019,"i'm sorry, i didn't mean for my dog to leave paw marks on your skin"
551033,i found out about talents when i was in my mid 30s get on my level scrub
551048,but smurfing doesn't ruin peoples games at all
551056,so glad i didn't buy wander full price!
551080,guess that wasn't obvious enough without the
551116,because you don't have a cellphone with you.
551131,yeah that birch one has always looked out of place to me.
551169,"don't forget to buy stickers though, 75% off!"
551223,a musician didn't invent guitar strings so they can't complain when people pirate their music.
551227,the only way to lower his win rate is letting new people play him.
551229,well a name change to 'riot china' would be a good first step...
551232,"there is no such thing as being racist against whites, don't you know that shitlord?"
551266,inb4 teams gamble their winnings
551269,because moving a server is easy
551274,"quality patch content, i'm glad someone took the time to do this."
551278,and worlds will be less hype and less loud?
551326,they wont since its a support item so it has to be expensive so other people wont abuse it
551330,"im not trying to be toxic, but you seem kinda salty"
551357,i would gladly take some of his money to help him with his problems.
551367,well if you can re-create the problem consistently maybe a dev will see this and will say that they'll work on it.
551371,"pfft, clg went 6-0 in playoffs while fnatic went 6-2 so that means clg is obviously the better team"
551385,"even if the recommended page was nothing but 10x10 rows of upgraded trinkets, people still wouldn't upgrade, because saving for half an amp tome when you're down 10 kill is way more valuable than vision."
551390,yea because giving a new ip a chance is ludicrous.
551404,i think you meant vac-ation :') you didnt phrase it right.
551410,they're sooo overpaid that they're willing to risk losing their jobs to get a little more money on the side...cough xwx
551423,"great idea, let's make skarner even better!"
551459,"way too overedited, next time play some classical music"
551462,better not pick a jungle then and run double support ...
551488,"no way man, not when there are super easy no skill jokes about bronze to be made"
551490,yeah they are never right about anything
551494,"whatchu talking about, i absolutely love when reddit tries to tell clg what to do like they know everything that's wrong with the team."
551526,oh there's your problem you're using a mac!
551528,unless tips are coded as minions -- like everything else is?
551630,b-but successful businesses can never be morally corrupt!
551673,i'm pretty sure thinking about whether to pause the game or not is their main concern when they are in the middle of a teamfight with skt t1.
551681,zqk quit keyd because of the incosistency lately.
551729,because everyone knows when you are being sarcastic through typed words... there is a reason people us
551736,"but dmg is the land of the scrublords and there aren't any cheaters, we just suck major dickage"
551747,right..because at this stage in the game they still deserve the benefit of the doubt
551770,too many feels man :((( i cri erytiem
551801,because playing against a nunu is so much more fun to play against.
551822,wow he died at the end what a noob
551827,i honestly think jks is the aus get_right xd nip-jks- inc xddd
551882,lol i piss on those few thousand dollars sounds about right
551886,"most players in na are not in the lcs, this % would be really low i imagine."
551895,omfg you guys are smurfing you should kill your self
551899,because reddit says pre-ordering is literally the worst thing ever and is killing the game industry?
551902,"yea, cus smoke takes lower skill ceiling."
551905,shut up nobody cares about your logic we're here to circle jerk we don't give a shit about how past games ran at max day 1...
551965,his attack range increase makes creep block less impactful
552162,maybe if we upvote this enough we will get some free shit!
552855,but he misses so many q's at the start of the video
553097,"guise, don't call them hackers or cheaters, just call them skiddies."
553115,people have so much faith in riot balance and decision making they expect them to just know which format is better.
553247,that guinsoo nerf lol now it is finally balanced
553305,"what you talking about m8, we'd always wanted a western cowboy shooter."
553369,"yah this is what the world needs, another generic survival game."
553802,if only anivia didn't have a passive
553827,just another reason why cs:cz is the best counterstrike
553828,its probably because you are toxic to play with
553897,shame it was mm maybe were getting 128 tick soon
553960,this game is available on ps4 therefore this belongs on the ps4 sub
553961,"great game, tons of varied content"
553977,bahahahahahaaha he totally hit his head
554099,"oh wow, he really went downhill after clg"
554219,acorn and imp make lgd team that is not poor
554362,yea cause waiting for an avatar prop was worth it.
554399,who is ibp and why are they banned?
554482,because there was so much other new content to do for solo playing.
554546,"gitgud, there's absolutely no rng in the game since they reverted rifle changes."
554581,oh i didn't know you were sarcastic.
554605,i guess because they are banned their opinions are no longer valid.
554725,deranking back to dmg from global.
554739,"grandpa, did you stop taking your pills?"
554752,obviously you just aren't using that pink ward that you always have in your inventory quick enough.
554873,24 people would just create a much more toxic environment
555026,"i would tell them to get rid of this karma farming posts, go to askreddit if you want this going on"
555034,"no way, they absolutely need more artists to make skins for additional cases."
555043,hearthstone has very little rng
555124,the double awp b set up works everytime
555218,yes because ibp did something on the level of murder
555227,ranks above le aren't achievable for na anymore after update.
555375,if only there was a search bar function where you could look and find posts that have been posted previously!
555402,[the 5 guys that got ported away are essentially token player characters.]
555406,what if i'm using my go long a macro?
555411,fucking kids can't imagine why people think you're toxic.
555713,he makes good calls because he can see the enemies through walls.
555794,"he deserves global, but he only has a 60hz monitor"
555821,yeah im fucking awful with every single one of these champions thats why im asking for them to be more rewarding when played well
555822,"stewie is only good under the one and only, our lord and savior, the big o."
555837,so that confirms that it's coming next week right?
555854,yea apotheon is really state of the art that's why it has such a huge save file
555919,"alternate timeline just like in wod, it's logical and totally makes sense."
555921,"afaik there's a rule on esl which says: terrorist must not use ak47, counter-terrorist must not use m4a4 or m4a1-s"
555955,i think its safe to assume clg doesn't have any strats
555958,"i thought we were talking about league of legends here, on reddit of all places"
555959,but it all goes back to riot in the form of fines
556088,pretty sure this guy is the first one to open up a varicamo m4 and this wooo let me use that gun immediately!
556155,i'm sure the police would bother with finding 40 people for a thief.
556231,but adcs are weak and can't carry and need buffs.
556325,2 to 300 fps is terrible though.
556346,so remove the animation of singed w its not a buff he just feels smother right?
556349,because it promotes toxicity and grinding.
556389,can't wait for those sweet caitlyn and leona nerfs.
556439,because we need this sub filled with any tips to get better post averaging 74 per hour

556605,clearly if your best is 0/8 your best is trash and you should probably stop playing league as the system kindly suggests

557675,"you're obviously lying, no one could enjoy leveling"
557690,"that's nice, but still fuck this game because there's no space battles."
557715,"oh gosh, do you think it's the cass top that's tilting huni?"
557735,why do that when you can just spend tons of money and make an average looking game slightly better?
557755,"ahhh yes, because multiple games that have happened before are not as important as 3 sets of games in the last week"
557761,"duh , they obv have to win it all"
557768,no better way to celebrate 15 years than by augmenting your pre order!

558051,it's amazing how they changed clothing and hairstyle from the first panel to the others!
558080,"yea, it must be awful to be so attractive you can't hide it."
558083,not even sure where these down votes are coming from.
558089,yeah because pc (which i already play on) doesnt do p2p at all.
558147,"of course , we all know the weakest role is adc."
558155,hmm... that reminds me a lot of the pose of arthas from the wotlk intro cinematic when he holds out frostmourne... maiev true villain confirmed?

559486,"oh no, a freshly designed female champion doesn't have sasha grey's face that says go fuck me, summoner, i'm a female and this is what i was made for, we better riot!"
559489,maybe ge shouldn't be able to review ow when they don't even know how the system works
559503,it totally has nothing to do with the insanely good jungler and massive upgrade adc that they picked up
559520,"well, i'm going to go play some comp overpass... global here i come!"
559527,"instead, it will come out next fall competing with a bunch of other titles."

559865,"yeah, it's not like riot ever pushed changes from pbe to live even against negative feedback"

560022,"kojima has already signed on to start working at gearbox once he clears out of konami after the release of the phantom pain, and battleborn is the first title he'll be collaborating with them on."
560067,you clearly have no aim whatsoever go work on that the game has no issues at all.
560068,but post vac wave global is pre vac wave gn3.
560082,he also got buffs but you know i guess that's beside the point of why people started playing him
560114,"yeh they can only make a shit ton of money if they win, they shouldn't have to get a swab in their mouth to prove that they aren't cheating."
560117,update notes x/x/2015 upgrade to gold bullets so you can break plant pots.
560130,"but you're global, you have to cheat to get there!"
560133,nice try op but your scope was blurred so your accuracy wasn't reset.
560177,"if you can communicate with your team to cc her into the ground then gang bang her then she can't counter play you if she is stunned, snared, silenced, and rooted can she"

560670,"lmao, some people can never tell the difference sine they are very similar."
560694,"this is why i disagree with the bo5 format, it doesn't truly show how well teams could adapt between games, if it was a bo7, it would have been tsm 4:3 if they figured out not to let pobelter on viktor in tthat fourth game"
560704,"meh, i don't care, its not like i really love this useless karma stuff"
560764,"guys just buy more chroma packs and this, along with the other long term bugs will be fixed!"

560908,yeah i am sure that most eu pros go to america because of the lifestyle instead of the money.
560927,so when will this be available for the ps4?
560943,it's a shame that he was forced into picking all these champs that can't make plays.
560966,idk reddit is like raven: we tend to know who in elements was gonna get benched
560996,"damn i bought nautilus 2 years ago, will i get some compensation?"
560997,but in diamond 5% makes epic difference
561035,because every kid grooming up wants to play guitar like their hero skrillex
561083,"it includes gunblade + hybrid pen marks, it's obviously a hybrid build."
561127,"nope, they installed it in the system32 folder."
561139,"it wasn't a bad ult, it's totally not my fault i completely fucked that up, we shouldn't even be taking that fight."
561157,"you're right, every early access game on steam went on to become fully fledged final products within a few years and completely lived up to their feature list"
561186,"blame jungler, say 'gg' in allchat, and afk"
561190,"yeah he would be broken beyond mesurment, release vayne/xin levels of broken"
561208,they're obviously close to ranking up.
561228,scream-rain-observer having better coordination than na teams confirmed.
561245,how dare you say xmithie is a bad jungler
561281,both contain some of the top tier athletes in the world!
561289,but the human eye can't see over 12.36 fpses
561324,"i honestly forgive them, the devs were bold and decided to use this never before used engine called unreal engine 3."
561343,i look forward to collecting 1000 more random things!
561353,why would we want a new op and map when he could get beanies and coffee mugs
561357,but it's olof so this shot must be impossible to make by normal human beings

563416,he only did it so he could jump higher with the added weight of the awp gone.
563424,yeah how dare someone promote themselves

563581,idk what ya'll talking about...talon is super weak and even super skilled players can't do that...
563586,can't wait to play the remake on my phone!

564751,"yeah, just gotta make another 20 posts on reddit then"
564864,i know its silver cause he didnt instantly flashed the wolf like he should

564971,these recepie rewievs are getting more and more original.
564990,"wtf are you smoking, it was this generation's the matrix!"
565056,yes metal in a microwave is the same as ink on an ssd... i presume you have a degree in computer science with that logic
565156,"hey, star wars battlefront 2 had it in 2004 but that surely must have been a copy from gta"
565194,no way man you just improved it's a placebo
565276,yeah riot heavily communicated on that
565298,i'm excited as a support main for all the new adc mains
565473,i thought orianna was a human in a robot exoskeleton
565483,"right, because this is 100% of the game"
565493,"gather up le reddit army, looks like its a downvote festival for a obvious"
565517,ye that's top cass mate tell him i said hi and he has amazing skill
565560,maybe its the fact mg3 is a new rank
565618,but vote kick works really well in csgo...
565667,because the reason we still use the air client is definitely lack of resources.
565688,we'll see that on the world's final.
565756,"couldn't find it in comment section, gracias!"
565794,this is what lost them the game
565799,"flusha is obviously a hacker, valve needs to ban him already"
565860,"yes, because telling your bot lane to stop trying to fight when they're 0/6 is so much worse than beating someone irl"
566028,same reason photoshop costs so much in australia.
566037,gotta have 2 mid subs when your regular mid is as unreliable as faker.
566067,good the game is 100% decided by a 1v1
566078,immune to death: oh no ripping off tryndamere
566079,does this mean riot is against teams scrimming each other and restarting a game rather than playing the full game out?
566080,then to defeat them we must use that ancient and most time honored of horse mechanics to defeat these new foes: lead them into a grove of trees and let the leaves suffocate them.
566166,**m4a1-s** $3100 600 rpm magazine 20/40 armored damage: head 84 chest &amp;amp; arm 21 abdomen &amp;amp; pelvis 26 leg 24 **ump-45** $1250 666 rpm magazine 25/100 armored damage: head 90 chest &amp;amp; arm 22 abdomen &amp;amp; pelvis 28 leg 25 ump 45 is a better m4a1-s for almost $2000 less!
566267,but it's not flaming if your team actually is retarded
566269,nah m8 since it's already almost too toxic to have 20 stacks anyway
566300,wow i certainly didn't expect xwx memes in this thread at all
566339,it will probably happen when half life 3 gets confirmed
566431,well as long as nolan stays were all good.
566449,"nah dude, the winrate change from 51.7% to 49.4% points to a sizable buff."

567106,they can t take adderal anymore
567138,yeah because no-one is playing nuke these days
567185,i hope its a teaser for a new overwatch website filled with the same great content as the others!
567202,"now i remember why i unsubbed, thanks for remindimg me goyim, less maps than a game from 2005 is totally acceptable!"
567247,who would have guess there by real people illuminati confirmed
567321,"no, there are no girls that play pokemon or any games..."
567348,this will make bbc super happy.
567349,"b-but guys, i thoght reginald changed and that he is now the most reasonable person on earth!"
567350,reek* hes implying it will smell of havoc when edg wins
567381,"yea, the heal duration from his ult was the big issue"
567382,"good thing riot is nerfing the windlash's speed, it's so hard to dodge"
567386,he's probably sandbagging like the chinese teams.
567440,i guess their plan is working just as they intended it to ... all for $
567492,isn't this the same as just watching my demo?
567507,yes because as a gaming company you are not allowed to make money.
567510,"wow, snake didn't even use a g36, 0/10 shittiest cosplay."
567537,they on purposly didnt controll it because it would get more kills that way
567538,"but it shudnt be ur responsibility to mute dem, thats to toxic!"
567561,"well monte finally spoke out and confirmed everyone's worst fears, fnatic fans are evil, they should be ignored and ridiculed no matter what"
567569,something small startup company
567571,"yeah a flick to doors when the enemy could enter through there, is really fucking suspicious, this guy is 100% hacking."
567606,"wow that was riveting, so exciting!"
567661,"yeah, and maybe they will win the world championship too while they are at it."
567666,like koo never played skt in lck?
567667,i mean how else is the government gonna get money to enforce their anti-unfinished-videogame laws?
567675,"yea, melee (one of the biggest esport scenes) is totally nintendo advertising their game!"
567680,andrew luck (huhi) is really working out for the colts right now...
567692,hey to be fair he also holds up the numbers for substitutions and stoppage time...
567700,yeah and going hard against novas and completely destroying them sounds fun for everyone
567704,there are no 13 year olds with any given sunday usernames
567736,"r_drawothermodels 2, still can't hit headshots, too busy making sure that no one can hit them with broken hitboxes :^)"
567752,guess you gotta buy 2 consoles and 2 discs
567777,"nice contrast between the opinions, i like the high contrast on eizo one doe"
567834,hes baiting regi with the bananas
567841,ye fuck them for pointing that out rite?
567846,i bet there were a lot of people out there debating on walking dead season 2 or magika this weekend.
567853,"but, but, i wanna kill garen from melee range as ashe."
567936,the best way twitch can peel for himself is by picking a different adc in champion select
568014,what if he wants you to think that
568018,i hope it's mark henry and all 7 of his alts that we can expect as unlockables/dlc.
568021,"yep, even worse then the holocaust, 100% horrible ... ... ..."
568097,yeah really mind blowing that they overlooked that aspect when they went ahead and released him with so many bugs that he was either worthless or unplayable for the first month or so.
568105,oh wow just because he's black?
568123,"he's just tracing people through walls, blatant cheater."
568130,"i demand bo21s, but the match has to go to 21 maps no matter what."
568175,yeah because people shouldn't do whatever they want with their cash and should only do stuff people tell them to
568208,so then you smashed your face into the keyboard and everyone died anyway
568291,"ez marth, gotta go for those ken combos"
568371,no because wow is a single player rpg.
568372,yes but they're *important* internet points.
568395,i'm sure you could get a phd in anything.
568400,finally i don't have to play these annoying games any more to get my penis-length-enhancer points
568404,yeah cause frostbite titles are know for their shitty graphics
568414,"yeah, but wouldn't the more *plausible* explanation be that this cabal of lcs team owners, after meeting in a dimly-lit, smoke-filled room, decided to launch an *all-out smear campaign* against an innocent fellow?"
568430,yeah ikr i say dont be bad and they get annoyed at me
568468,all that cases money going into a good use
568491,but computer bug are easy to fix and find in hundred of thousands of line of codes.
568565,100 kills ez streaming has ruined a god
568568,"you were moving, you are inaccurate when you move you know?"
568572,teach me how to hear his typing
568592,games won in a row obviously matter aswell..
568651,oh.. i thought everybody controlled their spray the hard way like me
568659,"damn, why are you misleading us with that name?"
568696,but it's got so many great titles in it's library
568713,"no best post ever, you see they nearly won msi"
568717,"yeah, because a dsi xl (or any ds) is more expensive than a vita with its proprietary memory cards tacked on."
568719,that guy at the end must be related to frankie
568743,none of what i just read was broken af
568744,t th m will win worldth you will thee
568755,i'm sure reddit knows a lot more about competitive jungling than meteos.
568758,"well, guess i'm going to rush in like an idiot learning something kappa"
568768,i guess he is making some awesome skins at riot hq right now
568774,"yeah what does ls know, it's not like he's been a more active player and team staff of teams than monte or thoorin."
568818,i think you mean console doom vs pc doom
568857,"i dont know man, vac incoming kapparinio."
568890,don't press the button if you know you are going to pass out.
568992,"mhm, because his actions in league of legends completely demonstrate his actions in life."
569013,but... i always tell someone they're a product of incest when they try to get a rise out of me...
569060,nah he's better off using a site that is so exclusive you can barely ever get a game started.
569068,"ill take it, i'll name my glock that"
569069,666 thanks for the free server.
569091,i also watched ska play on bootcamp and his screen didn't shake at all when he fired his awp hacks for sure
569118,yeah adc's should really have zero counter at all.
569131,but...but... its sony support they can tell exactly his history just by saying his name .
569132,"nope you missed your chance, only people who read riot's announcement are getting the skin sorry"
569133,because those two things require the same set of skills.
569160,*well... you see... it's a book... not a game...*
569182,"obviously a ladder there, fucking up the hitboxes!"
569201,"better buy a knife skin son, the default knife has hitreg issues, thats why you didn't get the kill"
569206,get off your fucking high horse and wait 43 days like a man.
569210,exercising is ableist and triggers me!
569223,youre mad ocean the big o odeag has been blessed with both godlike cs skills and good looks and you weren't
569242,"straight out of the ama from him, high quality journalism"
569253,"don't you be joking, i'm twelve and a half!"
569262,"if only kaj kunnas would've hosted it, if only ^"
569266,cuz we all know you can't get any precise aim on a console at all
569269,"yeah, no storage space on cartridges that cost twice as much as cds and graphics that looked like they were textured with stretched thumbnails really made for a great system"
569300,i'm sure that pobelter is the only player in na to have ever done this
569309,except hiko is way hotter than beckham
569329,"yeah, and you should also have to do a driving test to drive cars, spend real time being arrested, and get killed in 1-3 shots."
569345,hey guys it's richard lewis fuck richard lewis
569347,"bro, you were obviously moving, so your shot wasn't going to be accurate"
569354,yeah because dyrus doesn't get shit on in this subreddit
569365,"because valve is a money grubbing asshat company, so they self advertise on their own program, in their own grocery store of games."
569366,"yeah, because you totally cant feel the difference between 60fps and 300fps on 60hz monitor."
569383,"totally, that is why you see the pros get lots of t rounds on inferno."
569451,so what you're saying is that raids sucked back then and it's just nostalgia that keeps us from looking criticly at them?
569479,"guys... he's global, he's 100% the best"
569483,"but, several of my level designs absolutely rely on being able to put bowser in a question block!"
569494,"dude you raise valid points against a guy maining a champ that does dumb shit while being simple as fuck, he's gotta defend himself with whatever means possible"
569507,the nostalgia in this subreddit is insane and is getting worse with each expansion... give it a couple years and people will start saying the ds was great !
569515,"yeah this rekkles guy is pretty bad, couldn't even get to worlds the last few years"
569530,thank you for your logical input
569543,"yeah, i also prefer the three call mid, two call adc, then two people instalock the same role, the rest argues and picks troll champs mode."
569564,because everybody refers to it as noxious trap
569581,same way lich bane is useless on akali.
569585,it's not as fun though is it?...
569605,what eleven year old didn't know about rape?
569613,"but he has phd and you don't, therefore everything he writes is correct and logical while you are just a random pleb that has no right to have an opinion"
569625,"no cbble plz, i want dem drops to rise in price."
569637,"that's why cadian plays in a top 8 team, am i right?"
569651,such healthy champion design shoehorn into duo lane
569657,how is jarvan supposed to carry all his low damage teammates without the massive bonus from his passive?
569690,"rito gotta make that cashola, how else would they pay for a new client?"
569704,he didn't know the game was going to be scary
569716,he clearly doenst know how to play the game either
569731,people who got an awp dragon lore are poor.
569735,"honestly, why do you expect them to do this when they don't have time to do bo3 deciders?"
569763,"np, hunters are imba anyway, whelps will surely die from a barrage"
569810,don't you know any champ with true damage % hp is overloaded!
569823,he obviously got rid of the aimlock and has only got wh now
569847,but i thought gamers were all dumb spotty freaks
569862,going to love watching to see if poe plays devourer kayle mid again
569874,"man, this brings back good memories to pre-vac mm."
569915,"next playoffs he will not choke, we have faith."
569924,pff she's balanced because she has no aa cancel.
569955,that's because they're different items
569970,"meanwhile i, as a mid laner, can easily burst down or assassinate these silly tanks with no problems at all, especially if they are leaning against me, i am the primary carry, and can kill tanks in a snap"
570014,no telling people they suck is what makes them win every single game.
570044,thats funny how deagle and sawed off needed some sync and tec9 with its firerate fits perfectly.
570058,but mobi boots 5 zeal rammus is so masterful and skill intense!
570059,"because when riot wants to nerf something, they nerf the champion, and every item they've ever glanced towards"
570071,"you're right, they should have used 2 shades of green and 2 shades of red."
570072,"yeah and next time they have a world championship in korea, they should make sure that it isn't at 4 am my time"
570108,"cool shot, but you obviously toggled as you were blind."
570122,"yeah, see all the fnatic fans saying they are going to 3-0 skt."
570133,"yep, they're so good because they have luck."
570186,dude you have like no sense of balance
570223,well you got those who say ''why didny you let me go x noob'' think all of them would be challanger in 1 week
570241,last thing you wanna do is take tips from a guy with a cloud 9 flair.
570245,"(no shoutout to dexter) yep guys its official, link hates dexter."
570249,dyrus's ama ... do you really need a
570292,this hasn't been reposted enough.
570304,"yeah,i guess only high end pc users should get to enjoy video games."
570411,yeah and we all saw ohw iem/esl is top quality with no delay
570429,"well now you're talking about eu, prepare to get downvoted"
570442,looks even shittier than before
570460,"sorry, but na fpl is just too toxic"
570992,hard to code minions in 23 different languages
571000,but reddit told me fnatic was poor?
571070,"if nobody knows those mechanics, everyone is even."
571609,"na shares our fridays with eu, you should be grateful we're giving you that much."
571715,if only i could find some doa5 dlc
571741,yeah because your opinion is so important
571742,league of legends does this so it must be good
571822,but then how will valve attract dogshit casual players?
572245,why is dl using a iphone in a htc sponsored video?
572303,"i mean to be fair with the way they are taking counter strike, they have enough 5 years olds"
572344,the community is upset because valve is holding them back from becoming global
572557,at their old age it is hard to accept change.
572569,idk what fiffy was on but sean was on adderal
572587,but...but..his spray was bad!11
572588,but..but...i just got my organizer of the year award last week!
572606,"no, the report system is a placebo."
572670,whoever is on trial is lucky having you there.
572673,"hitbox update, majors, source2, vr development, weapon balancing (in both cs go and tf2), content updates that keep games fresh... yeah, hardly anything"
572675,team coast stealing all that eu talent with the money they made from nrg
572743,"yes, because valve has fucked up something which did not need to be changed, no body should ever complain but instead never go to a site."
572781,"yes nvidia invented gddr5, hbm, and dx12/vulkan"
573021,"i mean it makes sense, he shot it in the hole"
573023,"i are very much so worse player because icon went derank me, but oh well... now i silver 1 but okay like global just bad solo team"
573107,"nah dude, its clear they dont really get along and will lose because of it."
573220,"yes, because all the real hackers don't use script and do everything from cmd line."
573235,blaming your troubles on shit teammates... i thought that was taboo here?
573250,"nah she's a woman, endless talking is their specialty"
573263,too bad bethesda didn't make a crafting system where you can make structures like stairs and other things that could help in the game...
573267,he install his cheats backwards this time?
573350,the multi stands for multi function duh
573351,damn he got home from iem quickly
573386,"man oh man i wonder why you got banned, must be because everyone else and not you."
573429,man leduck is moving up in the world
573898,"they'd never add that, it would lower the skill cap too much"
573954,"thanks for making cs political, i appreciate it!"
573963,"well the spacing part he probably learned from doublelift, and wording sounds an awful lot like warding which is another strength of doublelift which must also hve rubbed of"
573971,no man the game is literally broken from new abilities being introduced.
574056,i just noticed that some people have the disabillity to notice a joke when i dont write
574102,"no way, don't you know that for a champ to be unique, their kit needs to be more overloaded than a thanksgiving turkey?"
574227,yes mass effects ending was every thing i was hoping it would be and more and i loved how all the decisions i made through out all 3 games really mattered in the end.
574276,but that's not the __right__ way to play!
574282,maybe if they didn't cheat people wouldn't boo
574285,"so good, you won't believe it's not a black ops 2 jetpack mod."
574372,yes because a damn near 100% lcs pick/ban rate isn't champion material
574428,i thought steel's comment was mature and really showed his growth as an individual since his ban.
574495,can't have too many carbs though
574536,im not going to play until they fix it.
574596,"well gee, i guess you shouldn't have killed him in the first place then!"
574611,still would be a sizable nerf to his currant state.
574629,stop violating my rights with misogyny and for some reason racism
574633,"yeah i agree, how dare they pick a champion they enjoy playing!"
574643,"alright that was a constructive comment, thank you tyler"
574644,dude's so bad he invents a colorblindness to excuse his permanent death screen in game
574723,"nah the company that made the biggest, most played game in history is clearly totally incompetent"
574786,yeah flash wolves were an equally strong opponent for og compared to getting either skt or fnatic
574787,lyte only goes for the low hanging fruit because someone being mean to someone else is just as bad as someone trolling and it ruins games to a similar degree
574859,yeah but the game should be made fun for me
574890,but sacrificing bo3 groups and apparently a proper broadcast is worth it if they can take the show to places like dubai.
574898,but they run faster with knives out.
575045,"it's just a silly game, people shouldn't get upset about bad behavior... unless that behavior effects my ranking in said silly game."
575080,yeah worlds is a much easier target than the oktoberfest(which already got cancelled) in a few weeks.
575129,"don't worry, u can't kill them even if you headshot them with a mag-7"
575225,obviously so you can check it and make sure it's not scratched.
575248,i forgot cs:go was meant to be as realistic as possible.
575261,yeah everyone knows holographic tigers and bombs can't possibly coexist side by side!
575300,the ending implied he found gtr already
575426,the casters pick em' videos got me hyped as fuck tho
575428,"yeah i have an i5 520m and intel hd and you know, it really bugs the hell out of me when my fps goes below 20 like come on"
575439,"war on drugs is a losing battle, valve doesn't want anything to happen to their special plants."
575453,that tristana looked pretty excited though.
575464,"definitely fake, he didn't get 1-shot by nidalee"
575525,i look forward to launch day when script kiddies bring down xbox live and everyone here blames it on ms and 343.
575542,you add so much to the conversation
575563,14/20 are korean on montes list and 13/20 for thooorin korean dick suckers
575565,yeah yellowstar is the best support in the world he is surely better than meiko/pyl
575580,makes a great competitive game in 2015
575604,"ugh, do we really need a thread like this on the front page every 2 days?"
575606,"yeh, cause that wouldn't at all finally push linux gaming."
575630,"remember, his account was worth hundreds of dollars!"
575639,it's easy when there's only one other eu mid to play against.
575662,because everyone says tsm will win worlds and not place 4th in their group
575776,"right, but you need 1-2 to blame when things go wrong."
575826,but how well will it work when i try it in bronze?
575880,the french don't believe in desks.
575886,well then maybe xbox should stop going down so much so we'll stop making bad jokes
575889,yeah wow really cool and interesting
575961,darth vader breathing is the xbox running sound
576007,im so glad i have headphones right now
576012,"op, these are just real buildings, you said screenshots op, gawd!"
576113,lol i know i about peed myself lolol.
576139,but dragon knight is the best dota hero
576160,clearly richard lewis brigading his own content again... when is he going to get banned from this sub too?
576192,because people don't donate or volunteer without advertising.
576247,"yeah, why would anyone want to get hype or have a catch phrase as a cs personality."
576249,this title really got me to watch this video
576312,they just had to make sure that lukashenko got back into office so their sponsorships were safe.
576369,"bit seriously, the insanely high rate of fire / low damage weapon delt exactly like the really low rate of fire weapon with massive damage!"
576391,"ap alistar is godlike in mid now, didnt you catch the memo?"
576404,climbed with that tip from silver 5 to diamond 3
576407,"yeah, your probably right, good one"
576445,"it's only like 7k gold worth of stats, it's not like you could just build full tank and still outdamage the entire enemy team with full passive"
576447,"of course, i love it when the enemy nunu bot spams laugh."
576476,tsm deliberately burning out eu talent to sabotage the region.
576531,"yeah i didn't saw any mistakes, flawless gameplay"
576539,yea surely none of the teams they played against can compare to the almighty tsm that took a game off ssw last year.
576552,"yeah the cost of the machine, the equipment to run it and the electricity are all free, no costs associated with it at all whatsoever."
576571,"lance amstrong never cheated, its a anti-american conspiracy."
576650,i guess you finally remembered the toggle?
576656,volvo plz fix all mac players so they can't breed
576658,"oh yeah bro, that one game which is optimized and happens to utilize all cores toootally discredits my claim, because its not like there are thousands of well optimized games that use 2 or maybe 4 cores"
576672,"yeah, we should always just root for the best team every game"
576717,look where that malph ult took him
576736,"yes, because in uk you can just go to tesco's and pick up a beer without being id checked."
576753,yeah considering just how precious a pizza delivery person's time is.
576758,"come now, that would require actual effort."
576827,none of the other 100 posts roll off your tongue quite like this one!
576845,but that requires patience and thinking.
576859,not like i suggested that and got top comment
576862,idk man it was just so similar to when gangplank was laughing in the river as a teaser to his rework
576863,"yeah sure because opening a video, waiting for another app to load, pausing it, and then turning the volume alll the way down is so much more convenient than a gif that can be played natively and without sound."
576913,the dev is asking him how he managed to get the aimbot into his head
576935,random beta invites for viewers would be a start
576936,"try putting overwatch as the top button of your games, this might improve your chances"
576970,"i'm pretty sure that blizzard network engineers can just magically wave their wands and more severs will appear, fully configured and ready to go."
576972,lmao nice he blocked a lee sin q with a clone... yeah very skilled...
576980,"rank elitism, because it really matters"
576987,"yeah but the teacher don't know if it is real or fake, better to be safe than sorry"
577022,"and mym threatening families of players, and the cw drama, yeah eu is perfect"
577077,i would ban lee sin because i'm in a low elo and i don't want these idiots doing this thing where they mark the guy and dive straight for a tower at 10% health
577102,"it's not as if it restore 8% of your missing mana on each spell proc, rito really doesn't know what they're doing"
577107,more expensive so you're more motivated to get your money's worth
577110,no please let the struggle go on
577113,"nidalee spears, morgana bindings lmao"
577123,"2 wins on the same map though, nv would have obviously won 3-2 if it was a different map."
577143,"look at his rank, he's clearly cheating"
577150,"damn, fucking hai can't see the future and predict that he will have to play again even tho he doesn't want to because meteos is stepping down."
577152,i feel like op doesn't understand the reasoning behind an xbox smoke.
577154,"oh my god, seriously this guy has been hitting the gym"
577201,yeah he took his laptop to the bathroom and messaged pronax while he peed!
577217,yeah cause you actually have to be good at the game to be global
577242,"you need to have shiv by 14:32, or the game is lost already."
577254,so you can't avoid fat people then...?
577342,this is so mysogynistic you have no idea
577375,"to be fair, he did say he bought armor"
577443,"but like, art should be for the people man..."
577457,"no way my man, he obviously just has a really expensive mousepad"
577464,i'd also love to see a version with green fire!

583455,no man they want blatant spinbots because it's a challenge.
583467,"to be fair, he did spend 100% of his time on this game coming up with groundbreaking new and interesting ways to insert his name into the game."
583515,"i come for the flame wars and memes, stay for the awesome champion discussions"
583522,no it's just that you are too bad at spotting cheaters because you're a post vac wave ge which is the same as silver 4 pre vac wave

595984,"sure, there is nothing wrong with hypocrisy."
595990,obviously when zed is not in the game absolutely nobody buys zhonyas or qss because they are bad items

596712,rival has more gamesense than most silvers
596776,"and that's why you never buy the dualies, they're too op and you seem like a try hard douche, using them."
596794,i thought is was named after that basshunter song

599023,"no of course not, riot need to do absolutely everything they can to make na an internationally competitive region by destroying korea's streaming system and then blatantly giving eu less competitive games, because na absolutely *has* to be the best region"
599160,lets add the .50 barett then because so many people are using the awp
599170,"yeah, but now she'll be in a gaming house"
599426,yeah cause origen has so much trouble building their brand on azubu
599456,"this is obviously a dangerous ak-47 assault glock that is designed to autonomously kill anyone that isnt rich, white and republican."
599484,doublelift forced to play adc poppy because meteos wouldn't trade him lucian.
599503,"yeah, eco rounds should be just as winnable as full buys!"
599576,"you might get a new knife model called ace of spades you have a deck of playing cards, you can left click to throw them off the top fast, or you can right click throwing 2x aces like a boomerang !"
599669,fuck you for not going with the status quo!
599795,as expected from the richest country on the planet.
600015,"seriously, we had to deal with na on team fire, worse than wildcard region, amiright?"

600137,if you want gritty just hope for a battle scarred
600148,shook is shit source: bronze 5 jungler
600314,"yes, because shroud is the only pro who pugs"

600489,liquid tier 1 world you've heard it here first
600598,doesn't matter he already is the top comment and is therefore correct
600629,still haven't got the message eh?
600648,his subjective opinion happens to be the correct one.
600655,"well - for sure - that thin, barely-able-to-cover anything shirt is sufficient protection from anything dangerous in the area"
600711,solo killing a player once in a sample set of 3 games definitely justifies calling someone a better player.
600800,"and that its no gwg yet, i'm mean c'mon!"
600840,he heard the ball not cross the line somehow.

601187,and this submission will absolutely have any impact whatsoever on the conduct of the community.
601202,ain't no one better than mancloud brah bjergson doesn't stand a chance if he subs in.
601219,"damn son, imagine how karthus ult would be"
601227,obviously it's the asylum seeker's fault!
601336,well mages can teleport so obviously it makes sense
601441,but it would lead to increased toxicity...
601463,"its not true to the original, because its perfectly centerd"
601480,"judging by the large amount of comments on this post, you may be right..."
601565,wow reading all this makes me wonder why they stopped the sister teams in korea
601580,"faker doesn't understand the game like reddit analysts do, he just has good mechanics"
601736,"hold on, we don't want to be too much like dota do we?"

601757,dude it is not your aim it is those pesky 64-tick servers
601876,"don't you know, every single game since the atari custer rape game is sexist?"

601978,"everyone knows that everytime two people talk about a subject and one convinces the other, the convinced party got shut-down/rekt and should get salty."
602013,"so kind of like the way that some redditors, at the end of their comment, put a"
602058,or those sweet zooms in her tits.
602119,yes because cod:aw is the definition of fluid movement
602247,sure... now to go play as a nanny beating up dragon's in skyrim.
602420,this is why nuke = most intense map
602448,"its because riot hates him, just like they hate gambit!"
602457,then get overwatched by the nova 1 with 150 wins thinking his game-sense and reflex are results of cheating.
602505,but 5 games of finest dota with 9 other fine ladies and gentlemen with no people who perma dc or rage quit
602523,they had to do it to shut down mekelek
602639,is this your first time on r/globaloffensive?
602763,"just ask the ts to plant bomb behind a box where they can't see if wires are down are not, that way you can pretend like the update never happened"
602773,"yeah it's not skill, he just does it way more than any other pro awper, he's just lucky over and over again."
602807,"yeah, it would be great if the big tournaments whose purpose is to show the best team, devolved into cheese fests"
602810,this is the most silver fire fight i have ever seen
602832,he would've showed up on the radar because the guy running up ct slope looked his direction but looking at the radar is really difficult
602870,"damn, its almost like the vac waves and influx of new players effected ranks"
602913,damn lounge commercials everywhere..
602934,even potatoes connected to your screen
602943,"wow you have a really giant sample size here, clearly enough to make a thread about it!"
602972,"yup, i'm really glad they made the decision to make torbjorn the only playable character in the game, really saves the confusion"
602979,plus the hitboxes are broken so you will miss anyways
602987,pretty sure you only have 4 teammates...
603030,frikin dmgs ur soo trash bc im le and my rank is bigger so im better xddd
603050,"yeah there is this awful bug that when my teammate picks yasuo we lose, happens every time worst bug na"
603093,because obviously faze clan is better than this stupid clan called nip
603099,but that's the only way to balance boats!
603105,"nah, betsy can't solocarry anymore because riot ruined the game."
603110,beat volrath in ashran silly cytoid

603274,may i do some zzz in my head?
603280,"as i told the other guy, makes so much sense comparing to a fps game rather than another moba game (dota2), maybe we should implement talking to enemies every 10 minutes for 1min if thet ever put this feature live"
603308,don't forget about the 2 dragons.
603320,it's people like you two that make rewards so meaningless.
603350,but robomodo specializes in awesome games
603366,tetris taught *me* all the dirty tricks my wife likes... logic checks out.

603431,yeah... he waste $2.50 on a monitor... what an idiot..
603471,don't let the 60fps burn your eyes

603475,don't you dare mock every assassin's creed game ever.
603477,"people use dj sona on aram, duh!"
603591,but then they'll be better than bad players!

603685,"ha, in your face sony fans"
603762,"clg is out, so obviously there is no need to show it to na anymore"
603782,"yeah, there is definitely no such thing as the difference between, say, a person's kills and that person's deaths."
603824,fuck you because we have different opinions obligatory
603859,how could you say that i'm so offended
603891,the dude is *literally* destroying gaming by having fun and not being enraged at this game.
603943,cause your team is absolute trash unless you win worlds
603955,"yeah the season where fnc was 1 hit on nexus away from making it out of the hardest group (na bombed in the same group), sk had to play without their jungler and all went 1-1 with c9 eu was *so* much worse than na"
603990,well i was making a joke but apparently reddit doesn't understand those without a
603994,"yeah, european fans cheering on a european team and booing the away team is extremely unusual."
604037,"yeah he should really be afraid of facing nagne, the 2nd coming of faker."
604065,"yea, because if he gets vac'ed, then he can just go back on his main account and rejoin"
604081,they followed reddit advice and used their art department to fix the client.
604089,well since vac is useless as shit i guess valve might as well remove it amirite?
604093,lets add some defusekit skins too
604147,"*pffft* it's called free publicity, man."
604170,"nah man, she's clearly an ad carry"
604181,"oh, the ol' good non-pleb mode."

604462,"ha, i can't believe they didn't recognize marcus fenix."
604464,im sure someone out there is willing to just give out 80 dollars worth of keys
604482,but i thought call of duty was the same thing every year?
604494,a smaller field of view is more cinematic.
604523,i'm sure that makes them feel way better.
604540,they apologies and gave me free electricity for 10 years
604547,so... i guess that means every other lcs owner are liars for not providing evidence.
604551,that definitely sounds like a great way for turtle to improve - give him less practice time!
604596,reported for posting sexist video game
604642,"damn, i can't believe he's played all throughout css and then all throughout csgo, and he decided to start hacking now."

604860,"ye, i am trying to be a hipster."
604866,"no, just becasue i'm 0/10 doesn't mean i'll die next time i all in."
604874,why would someone support one team when they can support their opponents too?
604885,this needs to become a meta so i can start throwing a real flash to real flash people who don't flinch.
604905,there was a 40 in my game 4 days ago
604968,"lol, yes playing 1k game on one or 2 champ will keep new player around"

605572,gonna be a good update tomorrow
605574,"makes you wonder, why all those players in the world (including pro players) gimp themselves so hard by picking the weakest class for their team comp in every single game."
605578,someone has an average of 5 r-dubs.
605579,without the title i wouldn't even notice its a paint artwork
605592,"but i thought pc's were too expensive, which is why you bought your xbone in the first place?"
605595,still stuck in bronze because i couldnt afford geforce titan graphic cards
605621,"they checked your eye movement and crosshair positioning through your webcam and they decided to ban you, because you were fishy."
605644,yay that's great i was sick of the massive battles from battlefront 2
605726,every other class is really hard to learn
605806,"yeah, advanced warfare is just like ghosts."
605862,"it's because they would have to translate to 500 languages, worry about how it would affect competitive integrity, and dont forget that if they give what we want it wont be a surpise."
605874,"on core naga brown boots into travels after radiance, support get arcanes"
605875,nono free legendary capes and free legendary rings are totally different from these horrible new (extremely awesome) artifacts.

605931,who said their choking days were over
605941,"hi, i'm not elo boosting i'm just wondering if anyone would like me to go on their account and raise them a few divisions."
606001,shame on him for seeking an answer through communication with another human being rather than going through the most efficient means possible!
606006,orianna is totally a hard champion.
606019,yep i'm sure sony just pick games out of a hat for the igc and didn't even know what rocket league was
606034,you just need your enemy to dc to make with your ult
606061,ye but just a casual 1v4 clutch with a tec9 vs full buy to begin with.. nothin that doesn't happen each and every game
606071,don't ya know the eye can only see up to 28.8756 frames per second
606075,"but no attack speed slow, so i don't see any hidden power in her kit."
606095,"yeah, cause its impossible to know something about the game without being a pro player, am i right?"
606107,i really hate when they don't take a screenshot just holding the gun normally -.-
606125,every experienced fighter can tell you that having your enemy's back against the wall is literally the worst position you can be in.
606150,"shes the best thresh in the world and shes also very good at every other support, shhh"
606160,is this the new rocket league dlc?

606262,make the doors a different material
606265,instead of updating the client they make a cookbook wp riot
606287,no one has ever suggested that before
606294,ready to go out in the groups ;)
606311,"if we are really crunching numbers here, i say a 6.6 - 6.9"
606320,"goddamnit stop directing people to my main, people go play annie mid she's freelo and hidden op"
606321,but how can he be wrong when he is justice?
606323,"but he has a phd, he knows better than millions of players telling him ~~to go play sandbox~~ different"
606329,i hear there is a flying horse delivery system that is pretty sweet.
606354,"ikr, it's almost like people are here to share game related content and discuss the game."
606373,i'd love to watch you play league of legends because clearly you've never died unless your team was aced.
606388,"yeah, grills are so annoying, right?"

606453,oh i didnt know worlds will be held in turkey...
606473,"yeah, because metal gear solid is the only games that konami make."
606499,riot can't use soundproof booths they need to keep competitive integrity
606506,"according to riot lyte, rito doesn't want to do anything to promote toxicity but a server move is acceptable?"
606522,yeah.. because it's not possible to be an hikkikomori if you aren't a fan of anime and video game.
606533,soloq winrates are accurate representation of how strong a champion is
606543,yeah i got my inspiration from unturned
606559,they randomly pick players who get their badges and the others don't.
606567,yeah because my early game centric laners should play safe against this garbage-on-lane champs til ww farms up
606600,or the whole thing is rigged so tsm clg and c9 go to worlds.
606647,it won't happen because the technology isn't there yet
606660,not the people who love to be completely different from everyone else!
606687,yeah but you see i actually duo with faker almost every day and he recently transferred to euw server and i asked him why are you on euw and his answer was sk
606699,but.. but.. tsm only bjerg dependent...
606752,"no, this subreddit has demonstrated no nostalgic yearning for any rare games."
606756,wow 20 extra heal rank 1 great work will definitely help him shoot up from sub 44% winrate into viability
606831,"yeah i know, but apparently reddit doesnt get sarcasm without a huge"
606834,"i was actually looking for creative, original, quality content from budding stars in the community."
606836,he had a paper cut on his little finger bruh...
606850,"fucking sweet, guess i don't have to adjust to anything anymore."
606861,but mkx just released last month!
606868,"what an original and creative post, i'm sure since this is the first kind of post like this, riot will listen!"
606911,well every game is a 1v5 for kennys
606926,seems like that will be fun to play against it
607010,"yes, because the euro does now cost the same as the dollar, and we all know that the euro is the currency for whole europe."
607038,yeah azir and rework nidalee were thrash on release either
607092,obvious assault only players that master assault so that they can rank up.
607123,is it because of yellowstar glowing brightly
607144,"it's now aura of the pack with the same effect, but it cannot be shut off."
607146,he has an irelia flair he doesn't get it xd
607148,tzz i might be fat but im not a nova 3 scrub
607542,"oh come on, it's the gm's job to waste time sifting through bullshit tickets that players create out of ignorance."
607543,til that the united states is the only country with taxes...
607800,get a roa and archangel for ap and mana and you're good to go.
607888,yeah there are no s tier players because of that in sc2
608082,silver 1 imo is the best rank to stop at
608191,"they were yes, but then khadgar happened, told jaina off, took over and let them back in and legion spoiler [he even lets aethas sunreaver back in]"
608281,"im so hyped for this, this is my new clg"
608488,"they're not all picking the same race, because humans can't be every class."
608865,or you have bad taste in friends
608924,"yeah fuck spray downs where highly skilled players can get 2 or 3 people, right?"
608927,yea please do a new menu it's much more important than to reverse the rifle-nerf
608995,higher caliber but lower armor pen cuz bullet shape
609115,"because that totally wont make any new players quit this game at all, having to spend so many hours in casual"
609174,because allowing the option for splitscreen would permanently affect all other gameplays fps...
609180,they probably pay more than europe
609189,"it's more skillful this way, just learn to adapt to it."
609209,but geno or some relatively obscure character isn't there so it is a bad roster
609367,we all know that you can't be good at this game if you are older than 25
609487,idk why so many people are mad at rito for implementing this cool new mechanic.
609581,"yea valve, step up your game.. more free stuff pls.."
609616,"oh yes, because art deco was invented by bioshock."
609779,ump spray pattern is a huge p...
609823,"if he can scoff at us, i feel we are perfectly allowed to do the same the other way, right?"
609850,he held the shift button a little too long
609874,"plus microtransaction, sw fans don't mind."
609884,but we pay money so that magically means servers can never go down
609896,but cs:go is not a run and gun game.
609913,what do you mean 8 gigs isn't enough for a console?
610091,you guys going to be hyped when it's going to be so buggy you can't play it for the first week?
610092,swedish colors flusha is from sweden hackers in disguise flusha in disguise flusha comfirmed cheating?
610126,"evil riot is now trying to buy politicians, gg"
610165,"annie, sona and ahri would not gain immunity from tentacles."
610216,what if i told you that you're not allowed to have a different opinion to other people ever?
610232,"shoot, dazed gave his opinion, so now he is an asshole."
610233,he de-ranked to smfc so he is really bad at the game.
610312,being the boss and doing your job makes you an asshole
610313,naw dude skt t1 is freelo in bo5 for tsm
610341,they should make a new half life every year so the content stays fresh.
610359,they will... when source 2 will reach csgo
610388,seems like they were sick of the pep talks
610424,but he streams twice as long as rektful brah
610428,no thanks i'd rather have skins
610516,at least the soul of the card wasn't changed
610517,he knows it obviously he just told you wtf do you not read oml
610560,lyte is totally ruining the game by trying to fix one of league's biggest problems
610584,exactly whoever a free agent follows that is exactly what team they are joining with no exceptions
610743,"exactly,shes just like adc teemo now!"
610760,orrr why don't we make it like sange and yasha from dota where when you buy both it combines into one item that takes up one spot and gives both item stats and ability

624100,a witch hunt seems totally necessary

624714,i wonder how much benq is paying him.
624732,"this is fnatic, we would like you to take down this video so we can use it"

624902,"it's not criticism, it's oppression."
624914,"mordekaiser is still viable in solo lane, as riot said."
624916,it's not copied straight from a pro player in a crosshairs workshop so it's a shitty noob crosshair.
624919,"in other news its hltv confirmed that f0rest not on heroin, n0thing is off the crack and snax has not taken and ketamine"
624941,yeah they are obviously hacking
624948,"yeah man, let's take a fantastic map, with some of the best ct-t balance out of all the maps, that has been a staple of the game for a decade, and remove it because people play it too much."
624956,"hey maybe it'll come with source 2, right guys?"
624966,yeah this guy has such a shitty spelling

625178,"i don't get why people are upvoting this, it's just a picture of a bunch of oak leaves."
625214,it works in my esea pugs so why wouldn't it work against olofmeister
625248,i really want to say he purposely omitted an
625260,obviously riot is doing gods work and everyone that say otherwise is toxic and needs to be deleted
625265,"yeah, what's a couple of years of lcs experience when compared to a couple of years of permaban for ddosing"
625329,yeah dawg i'm one rank higher if that was me i'd have a 7k.
625355,"my friend with a ps4 said it, so it must be true!"

625374,yeah because eu has never been salty in the past 3 months or so.
625376,"so to test the instant feedback system are we supposed to rage, be homophobic and racist on the pbe?"

625444,yeah rito kick out anyone who chants tsm during the finals.
625456,thank you for that info that we didn't know cause we never read anything about champion mastery in the announcement page or the microsite or the pbe notes
625472,i agree with this post faker is a bronze v player that never did 1 good thing well in his entire career and pawn is god's gift to this world so he could showcase his high lvl of play by getting outfarmed every game.
625491,"oh look, an original idea regarding champion mastery!"
625497,i hope they don't throw those pc away
625504,they'll never see this one coming
625583,because every scenario you want to be using your mantra on q.
625591,"yes, it's such a headache when people post what they want to talk about and not what i do"
625596,**cadian is a very horrible person because of this**

625701,"yep got it matey will pass it through to the developers, man reddit is a great way to change the game :)"
625729,"they're primarily a money-making business now, til valve isn't a not-for-profit organization... anymore?"
625774,but they've already manufactured them and they're sitting right there i should get them for freee!
625778,he probably won't regret this decision for the rest of his life.
625806,im as sarcastic as can be without the
625809,"nah dude, if lol wasn't is what it is in korea it'd be dead worldwide"
625812,also you can go ahead and build the mother base for them in metal gear solid v and then they can just jump straight into online battles.

626233,"pasha will crush him in his armpit before the match, sorry m8"
626234,"don't worry, vp will be out tomorrow too :)"
626753,"wow, this is exactly the same as when doublelift left clg, such respect from both parties"
626757,he's nuts and more consistent than jw
626911,need to work on your hand/eye reflexes.. you should of totally been able to steer around it.

627165,"yeah, why would they change the hitboxes, everyone loved the old ones so much!"
627169,"what a noob, dying next to the tree."
627213,i downvote any post that isn't about pvp botting or how the mods are nazis bc it is such a rampant problem that no one else is allowed to have fun playing the game until it's fixed.
627337,we can compromise: lock at a solid 32 fps
627349,umm... ok... that's normal isn't it?
627373,pshhh wait until you hear that some 11 year old squeaker has fu**ed your mom for the 100th time that week... then you will appreciate the community
627508,how is it volvos fault you was playing fnatic?
627516,but this game is supposed to be flawless!

627770,i can't wait to get an avatar accessory code in my inbox on the 15th.
627784,"practice the rng that is the new spray patterns, makes sense"
627866,yes i guess the other 99.9895% of players in the game are trash
627891,better cry to valve so i can spray my guns in this game about precision.
627901,sean quit btw because he knew about the upcoming patch... its all clear now hltv and illuminati confirmed
627938,i think you mean valve should make a rocket launcher with extra skins.
627946,yeah ska is the scum here for not taking stolen money
628049,but they won the 1v1 tournament
628163,"yeah, they'll probably patch out all of that work they did just because they hate us real gamerz!"
628200,"i'm sorry you missed it, it was only $100 gift cards pretty much worthless really when you think about it"
628365,your right riot doesn't balance the game around 85% of their player base
628391,hmm if i step in front of him he can't get away yep doesn't add anything at all
628736,the buff fiddle needed but not the one he deserved.
628738,somehow there is always someone standing perfectly still in that exact location... what a coincidence.
628855,"yes, the same way morrowind and skyrim were on the same engine"
628926,but i saw every single game pob played and can safely say his average kda was higher than huhis he must be better
629011,"you're supposed to no-scope anyway, scrub."
629120,they're not bad as the daisy cdi games
629183,it's lucky rico was packing that *loaded* rpg; the warhead sticks out a good 12 above his head so he doesn't break his neck on impact.
629259,you gotta know your budget if you want your school-shooting to be a huge *hit*
629284,ad blitz is obviously only viable build
629295,well christmas just passed with csgo being on sale... hmm... what happend
629327,git gud before you start playing
629339,but the purple circles make us do more damage!

629391,"well yeah, there's no reason you should have enough gold to build it anyway"
629436,yeah guardian entrys with an awp that is just noob gun he should use a mans gun like friberg.

629753,"yeah, pretty amazing that pro players lose games in mid/high diamond elo"
629792,"yup, eu fans confirmed all angels."
629814,"pah, just like blizzard to make us kill a pve mob for a pvp item!"
629838,yeah i'm salty because my team is always bad and i always top frag and they can't do anything
629851,redditors are too stupid to understand sarcasm without an

630132,wonder if they'll import na talent.
630165,maybe you should do something instead of doing nothing?
630204,it would make sense that you'd get downvoted for such a controversial comment
630214,"china is practically the wild west of league, thank god riot is going in to teach those savages how to properly run a league!"
630298,funny how you are being toxic by your own standard now but hey that's allright because he was toxic first right?

633068,shrc is super hot royal crew dude
633076,"yea, i heard jebus got very rich from his time at g2."
633116,"mojang are looking at this thinking, with mods and command blocks, we don't really need to keep the java version bang up to date any more... the community will do it for us!"
633124,we definitely need two different worms titles on the xbox
633131,"the technology is simply not there yet, do you imagine how much work it is they have to trenslate it in 25 different language and shit and have a special crew to respond to question conserning it"
633212,those eggs are awesome because they're original and gen 1 and og as fuck.
633215,"no mens, flusha is best entry fragger eu"

633232,this is definitely the kind of constructive feedback that will fix pvp.
633248,"now shes a duelist, her ult aoe heals her team."
633258,but if your a girl then you are stealing viewers from serious more deserving gamerz!
633278,"yeah, fuck riot for making new content and trying to make a better hud for their players."
633288,everyone knows quoting = plagarism.
633291,csgojackpot is my favourite map
633306,"dude, it's not patronizing, i don't even use all 9 deck slots, having more would be too confusing to me"

633314,"wait, people don't like when i do that?"
633364,dennis is renown for is insanely good igl skills
633410,can young people let me enjoy my competitive modes of computer games then?
633421,gaining an advantage by having more skill than your enemy is basically cheating.
633433,it's not like they took 1st in lcs reg season or anything.
633468,you forget it costs more money to manufacture digital games than physical discs.
633469,uzi's meta?but uzi is an adc main and adcs are trash
633499,bomb timer will be changed to 55 seconds.
633502,i think they should also remove the defuse noise.
633506,"no, obviously you have to upvote it, make a second account, log into that, and downvote it."
633555,"as my ingame name is blacklotux, i really hope that skin comes into the game, i would love it, have babys with it, and having a happy future with it"
633615,santorin actually doing something in a game o_o...
633635,stop oppressing me you male scum.

633663,you just got lucky you lucker dog
633683,next thing you know kids will be trying this in real life
633722,"yeah you're right, we should spam the frontpage with the same topic over and over again"
633755,"it's not a good idea if riot doesn't like it, you stupid noobs don't realize that riot is all-knowing, so what they think is good, is actually the absolute best."
633769,it's okay though because adc does so much dps lategame.
633781,that's what you get for using skype
633806,yeah let's make fun of silvers for being bad at the game!
633811,of course the main carry is an unranked smurf.
633830,"good job on wasting a valuable tactical resource, nice teamwork"
633895,"yeah, let's go heathstone way and only have a set of prepared positive messages."
633948,"is the new meta to hate on germans, now?"
633965,there's still one narrow entrance onto site
633966,"yes, but where can we try it out?"
633996,well music kits fix everything right?
634004,"there's weird high chunks, see, there's one to the right"
634039,for 800 dollars i will make you one but you have to pay up front and im not signing anything
634073,but who's gonna play with him if he's the only csgo dev?
634081,"you clearly moved while shooting, hitreg is not broken"
634099,they could replace the peaches with soccerballs.
634158,"yeah, because pugs are super cordinated"

634401,"sorry that i dont live in the past, things have changed, imports have been made, in every region, if we talk about history then history has been made domestically where for the first time every a team went undefeated, but no i will be called stupid if i hype them up cause eu is shit and the east rocks"
634455,fnc took skt to 5 games but og took fnc to 5 games and edg took skt to 5 games its an og edg final you heard it here first
634460,playing the game is a burden therefore earning ip is oppressive.
634464,"you can't blame them, you're stopping them from going pro!"
634484,"didnt you read the patch notes, dead man's plate got added to the game"
634501,then they are going to delete the extra mission they spent who knows how many hours working on.
634514,"yeah sorry, i'm pretty dumb obviously haha."
634549,as is a map that is specifically marked as for advanced users only
634568,"absolutely, like why would they take barrier, it's not like it's a direct counter to ignite or something."
634610,clearly the game we've all been waiting for...
634636,"yeah, a multiplayer game that consistently connects people on opposite ends of the globe together on a p2p connection is amazing."
634640,"i don't know what game that is but boy do bullet go fast in this game, it's just like sanic"
634651,i think this icon should be free and part of the champion mastery system.
634666,"clearly not to make fun of people like you, but to confirm i'm scripting"
634718,"yes, 90/7/3 was actually the day i was born ^"
634724,yup that tsm playstyle definitely leads to dyrus making poor decisions that make him free kills for enemy junglers
634780,eu should import more kr players maybe they can get out of groups
634783,yeah sure.. febiven was basically nonexistent this series
634807,yeah we arn't gonna just drop our 1 hour cooldown guild bank spell...
634834,"league of legend has a dark, secret past"
634847,yeah cause stating that another company gives free stuff to a free game means he has downs
634874,"yes, you are the only fucking one on this planet, the one and only special snowflake that is hyped."
634931,indeed ekko's ult is point and click with no counterplay possible
634954,i bet he's just using that knowledge to write hax
634967,that is 3 whole days already riot why are you making us wait so long
634980,i guess the twitch chat was like: nice double hs flusha; great shot; very nice
635009,those were some well thought out and fair reasons
635021,i thought that was just called fallout 3?
635022,"yeah, fuck gamers for demanding games be shipped finished and not 50% locked away in on disc dlc."
635036,"he is right, you don't need to use e, just use flash instead"
635687,maybe valve will start encouraging more staff to work on csgo
635752,it takes valuable time and money to put these bundles together.
635953,yeah who wants a working game with hundreds of cars and a great choice of tracks when you can (hope to) play project cars
636186,"no, i responded to a very specific comment that i didn't take the time to read."
636265,you're right... seagull is such a casual
636381,yeah testing how well it works with streaming
636416,"na doesnt understand ties so rito cannot put bo2 in na lcs, its pure logic"
636417,"froggen to grav, thats gonna be fun"
636607,they have to play at least one major with it just to see how it goes.
636700,pro sports is just watching criminals in between crimes
636713,"global is too easy for me, i should go pro actually"
636763,he actually said you make me erect ;)
636817,i mean the lpl picks weird shit like irelia support and nautilus mid so honestly maybe the fans thought it was a real comp
637017,you should have showed up on time.. but keep blaming everyone else for your problems because that is definitely how you get ahead!
637061,"i would play all the metal gears on pc, but one time when i played metal gear solid 2 there was supposed to be a shadow of vulcan raven that was supposed to appear but it didn't, so i am just gonna buy the whole collection on ps3."
637178,but solo queue is not important
637271,yeah and almost like announcing literally years ago that it wasn't anything similar to fable just set in the universe but hey fuck them for letting everyone know beforehand that they wanted to try a new style of game why aren't game devs slaves to what i want
637286,"yeah, i heard esea was the better way to get into fpl"
637292,ocean should check this out - free learning lesson
637315,sony really shouldn't have built their deck without trap cards.
637365,yes lets stage a mass boycott of over half a million players that'll go well
637407,na fpl and chill does not fit in a sentence
637523,"just remember, they're not american so by default their better and more deserving"
637660,"yeah, you're right, the tauren, trolls, horde pandaren and blood elves are super evil."
637711,ha i found this post very amusing!
637737,"yes ldlc is an online shopping in france, you can buy mouse with aim hack integrated"
637828,no they are not you obviously have no idea what you are saying ;)
637831,"oh right, orphans have never played videogames."
637839,"yeah i know right, it's not like they changed players since they lost to sbenu"
637866,swag needs to kill this stewie2k persona right now before this gets way out of hand.
637891,"silver 2 mate, reddit ranks don't lie"
637940,"because forcing them into having an even larger gap on their resumes is justified, nobody deserves a chance in life for taking my 50 cents in skins!"
637970,"what we need are cod like kill cames for the last kill of every round, just like in cod"
637974,"yes, because $0.99 games really need to be resold."
637986,yea titan should be top 3 ez scream
638011,yeah there's more games sold because of smurfs
638016,lets change everything to how it was in 1.6 because it was such a better game
638049,the technology just isnt there yet
638182,"low level dungeons are srs man, can't have dps pulling things!"
638205,its not fair that you get to talk to the enemy team during warm up and i don't (because i chose the option not to)
638350,obviously as easy as just having it in the client
638520,no you were supposed to read them in morgan freeman voice
638543,"starting off 2016 with a bang, eh sony?"
638572,that's an odd way to spell bullshit liar
638597,if that's what you like to use for lube...
638619,please tell me there's an implied
638670,"well you have an amd, what do you expect"
638777,ok then i guess i'll just stay semi merged into your face and half a sheep
638779,ye vac bans just come out of nothing
638839,giving him an even stronger lane phase than his already oppressive one was really needed i'm sure.
638903,theres always a chance for that good drop
638908,you have to remember riot games is a small game developer
638950,it's not fun when u mistakenly invite a global to a nova queue
638986,"i dunno man, he has a *ton* of subscribers"
638999,"bro that team that got aced against zion spartan sure didn't know the concept of kiting, despite being masters / challengers"
639012,exactly being an unkillable tank assassin that can build full tank with 1 damage item to blow you up is just part of his identity.
639020,"well the 'best team in the west' crashing at msi ans afterwards is a flop while a dominating team winning the split not undefeated is ... yes, definitly the expectations and reality duftet more for fnc than for tsm"
639057,glad we got this meme for us adults then
639108,still salty... how much did you lost
639123,it's the client telling you to go into a custom game to practice against bots.
639183,but they are 'trustedreviews' - surely a website named like this must be trustworthy?
639196,build full movement speed so you can outrun him
639211,just imagine if he had the sated buff
639229,shows how strong adc's are in today's meta
639235,this was all done on purpose so the teams would not be able to get to dreamhack
639264,because concepts can be similar and yin and yang is a new concept that hasn't been done in anything else.
639296,because someone playing a gamemode they like is so awful and should be punished!
639365,"yeah, they really should revamp a site because teams really don't execute on it."
639366,"yea, internetnl would have been better"
639437,helps a lot in those 10 kills per map.
639511,yeah dude fuck riot for banning a toxic player that had a lot of chat restrictions aka chances to get reformed.
639580,good thing i haven't been checking my messages every 15 minutes since the announcement...
639603,that's the perfect chance for a reddit team in lcs
639621,"but i thought part of being a pro was adapting, and if you can't adapt you die"
639623,yeah gambit is the poster child of that being a good decision
639632,"not really, i mean solo queue doesn't matter and everyone is just so toxic."
639689,"remember, it said slower rate of fire so it obviously is worse then the a4"
639718,all you need is 115 stacks and you can one shot it
639728,can't shoot fingers valve you dun messed up.
639767,obviously hitboxes fixes hit reg issues.
639819,"yes, please, ap tank jungles need more terrifying options than they currently do with rylais, ibg, liandry's, roa, abyssal, they definitely need an ap/armor/mr/tenacity item to let them get their sorc shoes."
639836,man you have such a solid argument.
639885,"yeee, cause if he was he would be op"
639899,obvious scripting why so many people praise him?
639937,he probably wouldn't say learn the *fucking* difference if he talked to the president of the united states of grammar nazis
639977,"of course not, why would we be able to report someone after carefully watching the demo from their perspective?"
639992,yeah they definitely don't do that anymore.
640049,"yes, dlift must be shit, since he has 101 less games than rekkles and is in master duoing with his support and not his mid."
640052,wtf are you on about they were all american and got into lcs and were great under the name cloud 9
640085,can we all just agree that gta io has the most realistic vehicle deformation?
640092,does this mean febiven is better than faker
640123,i'm sure this petition will have a huge impact on valve's decision regarding the next operation.
640125,and again freakazoid having no impact at all.
640155,it should knock players to the ground and stun them for a short period of time
640156,f0rest going to fnatic confirmed!
640166,yea and all those idiots who would rather watch pro sports then play them.
640174,800*600 makes for really clear videos and gifs
640290,4 shots from an adc don't do any damage since adc's are useless
640319,no i must belittle other people's accomplishments
640363,too many repeating champs should force use of tahmkench and teemo for variety's sake
640430,"viewmodel setting please, that looks really good settings."
640474,oh no competition this worlds sucks
640541,making people buy stuff instead of unlocking it is always good for the consumer!
640562,i thought it was a solidarity thing from one terrorist to another
640570,"yeah man, mushroom biomes are really rare."
640587,juggernaut-tier diana sounds so fun to play against.
640607,"gee, thanks for letting people know so they start asking again..."
640608,"gee, your other controller seems to be missing its case."
640630,"thnx volvo, literally unplayable."
640655,"stupid player named kqly, obvious hacker"
640656,"fuck you, why am i being banned you riot cunt!"
640672,i feel like chewyy is missing here
640680,good thing that geforce experience is fully bugged and i can't install new driver or even use the software.
640687,"gee, i'm absolutely shocked an ea/dice game has that kind of oversight in it"
640697,you mean at the start of the round you dont shoot them like everyone else...
640754,dont tell me what to do with my money!
640789,the fact that they only won because of two bugs is perfect evidence of that.
640802,"i don't care about improving, i want a new teemo skin already"
640808,man i wonder if chief makes it out alive
640825,yeah really spend all your time in a chair at work or watching tv on a chair at home like everyone else!
640832,clearly op just got the french flag upside down
640860,"yea, you are right every single current gen game released so far is a perfect ten."
640887,but seriously when does the new ui come out and how come i have a game i didn't buy
640997,i know right...saying febiven is top 2 mid is pretty hilarious
641009,"oh yeah, that team would stomp everyone!"
641070,"now guys, from now on, all posts with 'scream' and 'all hs' will be removed for repetitiveness."
641104,you are going out from everywhere then?
641128,yeah couse it so easy to ace on a eco vs full buy
641143,"yes, i was being entirely serious."
641153,"come on, acs is clearly one of the best games in the genre, i mean it's set in london, what more do you want?"
641215,yah im sure they would announce that on the playstation blog makes perfect sense.
641222,"nah to prove that you actually need to show that you're not touching the mouse or else it's not 100% sure, but at least we can get a really nice phone video where we can't actually see the bug at all because he's shaking his phone, but that's way better than not being 100% sure that he's not lying about his mouse"
641233,because it is ea and that is equal to being bad!
641239,"why use the search, just add one of the 50 people you know from the top of the friends list."
641241,probably because the only plays of his that you see are in montages
641317,shit talking while na's asleep i see.
641326,"you're underestimating koo, they have vastly improved since their ge days, especially with their new jungler who replaced that weak player called lee."
641339,especially her light rework and ultimate skin this year
641385,"yeah your attitude is much better, i will take tips from you instead"
641392,5.0 attack speed = 5 attacks per second this isnt going to be broken at all
641398,twitch viewers really are a reliable source of valuable and accurate feedback
641410,"no man, call of duty has the best servers, it is the best selling first person shooter every year and it has also the best servers."
641412,i can tell you know a lot about the current stage of vr
641436,you just couldn't see him cause you probably have an ezio monitor.
641443,well i guess riot doesn't like making money?
641450,"wow, perfectly logical wall bang, lets post it on reddit and try to get some karma..."
641455,resubmitting your post that got deleted 30 minutes ago - good one
641458,*improved graphics mod only 29.99*
641498,so how much of these do you need to add to a server?
641504,"but it's on wikipedia, it must be accurate"
641538,this is more real than real life
641557,now i know why janna ad jungle didn't work
641562,"however if you try too hard, you're a try-hard so you gotta find good medium between being a shitter, and trying too hard to win."
641644,because that was the only thing borderlands had going for it.
641645,"a very original idea, good job comming up with that all on your own"
641660,but why play a game for the great mechanics when you could have a great story?
641671,but dl is good just cant carry his teammates
641698,"as the games this weekend proved, obviously."
641709,"yeah, obviously c9 was the only team that made mistakes."
641714,"yeah i mean the jews must have done something wrong, right?"
641761,i think you're the first one to care.
641831,"maybe he has a workout game, 5 push-ups per kill 99%"
641832,"apparantly, while i'm at it i hate pizza and sony...don't even get me started on no man's land"
641842,"good guy rito made bundle 2000rp instead of 250*10=2500rp, i knew that they aren't greedy."
641851,i bet those elise buffs will make her god tier
641893,club penguin is where the real shit is at...fucking scrubz.
641901,"smoking is edgy as fuck dude, no question about it."
641909,how i am going to tp to lane now
641956,nah kalista that uses her ult to help her support get to lane faster shows that she has counter play duh
641964,at least hai is the best na rengar.
641985,it takes a lot of skill for valor to mark the correct target.
642013,"yeah, riot is clearly lacking money."
642014,then they got banned for sharing personal details?
642030,"i love triple-ported old flash games, totally worth money."
642032,"you have to hold 'w' when bhopping, it makes you go faster because it's the forward key."
642040,"women are allowed to fuck mothers too, don't be so insensitive you sexist pig"
642112,the only way anyone can be good at this game is to be hopped up on speed.
642117,yeah i think the basic trinket should cost 35g too because any idiot can just slap down a ward too
642133,so we get a closer look at a cigarette?
642181,"of course, they won agaisnt vp because their coach had autoaim"
642184,uhm anyone that has muscle is a douchebag bro
642187,you could save lots of money and get better performance by building your own tablet.
642216,i'm sure that wouldn't motivate anyone to cheat...
642219,"right, because everyone used sixaxis on the ps3"
642221,ooh gotta kill em with dat tp boiiiz
642247,you should go to the fallout sub and tell them that fallout 4 is actually the 5th game in the franchise and that new vegas is the 4th.
642248,if we are getting rid of inferno why not dust 2 as well.
642249,i use mwheeldown/up and mouse1/2 to crouch
642267,"sure let's let them have baron, we'll get the timer afterwards anyway."
642278,i thought he was the dictator from just cause 2?
642343,yes because no one is talking during their kills they all know what to do and don't need anyone to organize them
642344,just because taiwan always performs in international tournaments for a few years doesn't mean they are good.
642378,monte is *known* to have very nuanced opinion.
642396,this post was totally about math
642397,"but dude... they can 100-0 champions, so broken"
642415,let's hope for source 2 in the next update then
642419,"and then they're going to nerf your money in pve as well, just like every other game does when they nerf stuff in pvp."
642444,"sc2 can have up to 200 units,league has 5. gg lol players"
642515,they went 2-1 against kt and 1-2 against cj clearly they got worse
642540,"like aimpunch, run and gun, and jumpscout!"
642543,"yeah, i want to lift my ban with buying an rp card too"
642552,yeah no wonder why all of reddit is challenger we all are watching the pros play all the time!
642594,greedy valve doesn't want us to have all the souvenir packs.
642603,hurr but the grind unplaybl game no story i havent played it since day one alpha i know how bad this game is

642669,and make her headshot autos deal true damage
642710,waahhh another arcade game give me ryse!
642786,"everything is too buggy, and due to that they cannot release a patch overview until all of them are fixed."
642793,"yep, in reality rl is really nice guy, he never lied or insulted anyone"
642797,"yeah remember guys, every single thing rahim said here is 100% fact."
642802,but best of 3 is the best format?
642814,paying 1000 to whoever could replicate this glitch again.
642815,please tell me you just forgot the
642834,they needed to translate the code into 25 different languages and make sure the code is legal in regions like china
642839,"yea any fed zed can do this, just a standard play"
642857,"yeah, having a ranged point and click fear on an assassin that also has a ranged stun sounds like a great idea."
642863,"how dare you like hltv, get downvoted scrub"
642870,lmao they tried so hard should've given the kill for the effort lol
642927,i'm gonna need every youtuber ever to make a tutorial on this
642944,clearly competitors would be able to see what makes the players scared and abuse it.
642966,oh yeah they really need to remaster that game for the third time
642995,"right, because that was the first game to ever do this."
643001,not a lawyer but i watch a lot of law &amp; order.
643011,"she doesn't has her eyes closed, she's ~~asian~~ ionian, you racist bastard!"
643046,"joke's on you, it's only because of the vac waves"
643069,"yeah, because kqly was basically a silver"
643075,no azzinoth is the planet the game takes place on
643099,flusha should be the last one calling hacks
643105,how dare you jokingly tag your post nsfw!
643116,yeah just make him worthless might as well
643133,"no, thats valve and its called music kit"
643136,"yeah if only flipside had some sort of 1.6 legend on the team, maybe that would have helped."
643147,np i usually don't deal enough damage to break that one
643154,because it does better on one benchmark that makes it automatically better.
643187,you are the reason why we are forced to use the
643191,because a game with a talking gorilla is trying so hard for realism.
643215,but that one less damage from lux skills when i use a skin with sunglasses.
643222,"finally duck dynasty is $15, i might have to pick that up today."
643229,so disgusted with these kayle nerfs
643234,"office t side is awful, i'm lucky to get a single round at times."
643249,video is 4:20.. ban from esl inc
643268,because the people who work on bugs and implementing new features are also the same people who work on skins.
643274,"try it yourself, its sooper easy"
643289,i always use it to make a note for friends in my friend list
643327,"yay, let's hype up the nerftrain and make sure champions that sucked for years get to go back to sucking."
643335,"neither am i. who in the right mind would support, if not actively fund, the genocide of whites?"
643347,but guys the sticker money is literally in the tens of thousands
643353,olof through the first7 rounds on dust 2 against nv
643388,"by zombie bug, does he mean how it's contagious?"
643451,"don't forget, these things take time because rito has huge tech debt!"
643461,"it's not bad aim, it's just hitboxes!"
643478,yea i agree you are totally innocent and this is your first warning ever
643489,just start playing a useful class allready
643500,yh lucian is totally op after the buffs
643509,yeah players dont need that so they it would be better to hear your crowd's cheer over your teammates.
643513,should takes notes from fnc notebook imo greatest team in history of esports
643606,that seems way easier than just opening the console.
643676,but if i pick annie support and rush dcap regardless of what's happening in the game i can kill people
643686,that's a good attitude to win and will definitely make you win more games .
643720,drawing a needed card is never luck
643724,wait are we supposed to be able to see them?
643746,because reddit hadn't gotten around to circlejerking audio until the mac voice problems
643801,lol fnatic so bad they have to cheese with cassio top and urgot adc just to beat tsm
643808,wowww omg.. so much difference.
643811,"what's wrong with being black or white, huh?"
643850,right... kinda like how bjerg beat faker in lane right?
643878,"yeah, if only faker would've known how to play azir..."
643907,ekko is the codename for the replay system obviously
643952,"the casting is probably the best in the world, they know everything about the game and provide i depth analysis"
643960,not knowing the scientific term for eating a girl out = nerd virgin probably
643965,"as one of my fellow bronzies once said: if it doesn't give ad or ap, i don't need it."
644043,better sound... sooo you mean more music kits?
644048,is it too late for tsm to switch to eu for better competition?
644079,"i guess not every one of the 7 million people playing have an identical opinion, who'da thunk it..."
644082,no idiot economics is all about comparing two prices
644141,that'll be boring if it's a podcast that doesn't have anything in it
644167,"well you know, the human eye can't see over 144p so it doesn't matter."
644172,* korea uses it * na and eu dont * korea beats na and eu * bo2 and bo3 *must* be the reason
644180,why do people need to do anything except sleep and eat?
644195,silver 3 which is basically global now
644473,and people thought being a rogue was easy.
644508,faceit's fantastic anti-cheat at work
644874,well... i guess only 3 and a half years after the xbox release isn't too bad
644937,"no, obviously you are an oculus shill who has been riling up people on a hidden thread on r/oculus."
645089,"yeah they couldn't even take a game off koo, a team known as one of the worse and bottom tier teams in lck."
645090,"nah man, 9 mins of voice comms highlights obviously makes reddit an expert on every detail regarding fnatic's shotcalling."
645108,because globals are always 100% right never make mistakes
645120,"unless he plans on ezpz deranks, why would he?"
645285,yeah teams with one play style always do so well
645299,i was anticipating lag and there wasn't
645342,1 upvote = 1 prayer that riot gets more brain
645491,"no, because according to reddit spirit is washed up, febiven is overhyped and rekkles is shitter tier, so fuck knows how all 3 of them got to semi finals at worlds (spirit being in 2014 i know)"
645531,it's for the betterment of esports mane cmon
645543,"duh, the extra weight provides recoil control"
645732,"i am pretty sure you used the smoke bug, that was 2 obvious!"
645994,"makes sense why they want to add a tether gun, alters gameplay for the better."
646040,cmon he was op with the w slow right guys?
646139,"no, psn is perfect and never gets hacked or goes down."
646153,yeah we really have so much to be jealous about
646188,"well if you look at this subreddit, it seems pretty dramatic..."
646360,maybe na can make it to the semifinals next year when korea is destroyed
646371,you mean you didnt want to play tennis as micheal?
646420,yeah nip won so many tournaments this year in compairson to tsm.
646507,"totally not a scripter, i see this all the time in my bronze v games, you guys are just jealous!"
646547,better than talon :^) give her mana and the loss of ability to e to allies.
646688,"no gaming pc, this room is shit..."
646748,"funny, seeing another fe character in smash made me want less fe characters in smash"
646770,"but, but, you can play your mii though."
646801,because no other factors go into the decision on what games to release
646930,but did he let you into the overwatch beta
647005,it protects your vital areas while you nimbly dodge the rest of the blows!
647075,"did someone say [thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker]?"
647119,netcode is a pretty big and challenging word.
647155,their ad carry must be a braindead bitch with no fingers if he loses trade after getting the shield.

647296,have you tried becoming an adc main?
647323,dnt u knw soloq is whn you suppose to win by urself ad no help from team
647341,is being ganked not your idea of fun?
647389,"wow a team owner against improving contract negotiation power for players, who would have guessed?"
647445,"so because it's simple it's bad, not like you're fitting 110% into the condescending gamer stereotype or anything"
647463,tahm kench is so broken in my bronze gamesss pls nerf bby riot
647464,a free janna ult if you hit a vital is terrible
647465,being able to parry a stun is weak af
647479,you mean where's the custom built pc?
647516,i think we are missing csgo jackpot.
647517,with a dak as well... what a scrub.
647563,lol what do u know about league of legends rule 34.
647601,"having owned a ps3 since launch, i'm sure sony will get right on that."

647661,bc u leap a short distance and instantly one shot someone
647709,"jokes on you, he was referring to electric light orchestra"
647736,"not only that, but the flash put him on edge so bad i heard he quit his job and started drinking heavily."
647806,ive been playing 2000 for years and i just upgraded to 2k16... subtle difference
647820,good that low elo is the meassurement we should take into consideration when it comes to changes
647827,it's obviously because riot prefers na over eu and wants eu to get worse.
647844,i know my grandma lurks craigslist for the best gaming deals
647875,"just use a team flair, you'll never have to worry about the shame ever again!"
647913,"we're talking about victorious azir, not galactic azir."
647992,"first he ddos, now he makes people go afk so they can lose games."
648016,"yeah, as a long-time halo canon fan i also enjoyed the way a couple of s4s were literally facerolling an entire covenant army like it was nothing."
648069,you get free entrance to pcmr when you get a pc.
648129,"that's why this is so rare, duh."
648189,but they treat their customers sooo shitty!
648262,yeah and the fact that it's an instant cast with 900 range makes it even more op
648329,same i'm mge but i play like fnatic.
648351,"because juggernauts always get away, unlike s3 ap nid, leblenk, kassadin and fizz."
648384,"just feed him early so you aren't the villain, and win late game."
648398,nah man we literally command riot like a dog on a leash.
648460,because ziggs requires a brain or mechanics.
648463,because destroying valuable ingame items is really helping the issue
648471,you named yourself riot sargonas in middle school?
648475,no because there is only one apple device and that's the beauty of it...
648508,"it is called onetapmid.exe, very good programing"
648601,"hey, ashran never ends, isn't that totally epic?"

648793,we best not buff any bomb champions today as today america almost lost its freeedom 14 years ago.
648814,because ad yi totally gets buffed by having an ap ratio
648879,"no, op doesn't understand... that's a feature!"
648892,toxicity is a much more pressing matter to deal with!
648961,u mad because i may have killed you ?
649006,if you know what an igl is you should know the map by heart.
649009,dw the increase on the mana cost on his q will balance him for sure
649043,"man, this comment was very helpful and inspiring."
649045,"all those bugs found of azir, patched when he was released."
649052,"just checked my inventory, no dlore or knives on it, so it's only on your side"
649134,"yeah, i've never heard of an app developer who didn't also manufacture their own smart phones."
649146,think about the value for money!
649177,maybe you should stop taking pictures of people enjoying the display?
649183,yes koo adapted to the cinderhulk real well.

649586,yeah i totally believe that's what happened
649615,good punishment when someone auto leaves at the start of a game and the bot wont listen
649643,your flair... euw... i think i know the reason why you havent got an icon
649652,"oh yeah i forgot, having a champ that has like 3000hp and still blows people in 2 seconds is not hard to deal with"
649655,it's because azingy started streaming again.
649662,"dude, don't you think that's a little generous?"
649706,"nah bro, ending up with low hp because it wasn't the first stat you leveled was a good system."
649725,"more arms race missions, please."
649752,"oops, should have used shampoo, trust me."
649840,yeah i like how they came up with some random song and claim it's the cs:go theme like it doesn't even have one
649876,i hope he made the pics for his facebook while he still was global.
649902,"yeah, like in cs:go, everyone can agree that krimz is a way better player than shox considering their recent form."
649927,obviously he plays better with the auto shotgun then the awp
649974,"true, his analysis has been so spot on lately"
649986,but only faker is the only repeat world champion
650048,now you can understand when people insult and flame you because they think you are bad :) - ban russians and instant no toxic players anymore

650076,"an italian melee character who goes to attack, but winds up taking a lunch break instead?"
650087,he practiced really hard and now is totally so much better!
650106,"hey you stole that comment from youtube, nice try"
650148,"relevant flair, not biased at all"
650193,"how about an increasingly bigger sign above his head after his 2nd q, so everyone can run away in time?"
650198,hey have you guys ever noticed he looks kinda like regi?
650199,pfft what about my boy regi tho?
650240,"obviously, it's so you can show that you're best buds forever with your bot partner."
650244,yeah cause buff adc please is such an offensive name!
650259,well its obviously because they haven't played c9 yet
650326,gta is too violent for your age
650334,dying as rengar is unacceptable.
650350,yeah thresh lantern could probably get mordekaiser through all of that cc
650483,"i'm the god here, excuse yourselves"
650503,even more generic sarcastic response ending with
650509,damn you must have a lot of cash :^ )
650544,all top players play in the same timezone
650555,q3 2017 at the rate they've been releasing updates recently.
650596,what if santorin comes out of retirement to play under hai so he can be told what to do?
650601,"it may be bugged, if you don't want it to crash your game you can give it to me - i offer 2 keys ^"
650609,no i believe that these games does not speak to us on a cognitive and biological level and hence we find them repetitive...
650676,because they mean everything obviously
650723,yes because i'm sure blizzard didn't think of this solution
650753,"yeah, and vp threw because pasha wanted a better chance at a souvenir dlore with his name on it."
650755,"sure, a company who run the biggest mmo of all time dont know how much their server cant handle"
650780,"she has a vagina, that's enough."

650819,"yes, this sub is fucking famous for its great predictions"
650820,"i can't agree with him being superb, he is only the third best player on fnatic after all."
650897,"yes, lets downvote a good husband who managed to get a wife who loves him enough to mother his child, and dont (by the look of it) minds her husband play videogames...he sure is a loser"
650902,"it's ok, they banned all piracy sites there, there isn't a way for pirates to access piracy sites any more."
650922,we really should buff the a1-s cause everyone is using the a4.
650973,any indie game not on a nintendo system
650991,"nah man, arkham knight was a great game, just a victim of a circlejerk"
650993,all hail glorious pao and her safe spaces!

651477,"refund him then buy him again, trust me its worth"
651488,that means all of nip can be cheating
651495,or.. could just take straight lvl 5.. :d
651500,$119 for a hoodie with a csgo logo is worth it.

651574,"y more ip sources pls, exactly what i need."
651581,if they set their expectations so low then that can be expected haha
651602,we should start a prestige system
651658,i just wanted to show how literally unplayable this game is right now.
651693,why does this have the fluff tag.
651763,it sure as fuck had nothing to do with the fact they picked up the best awper in na
651767,that is completely wrong in my entire 3000 hours i have never had any fun at all i dont even know why i play this game i am still playing though for some reason even though i defffinitely hate the game
651794,vp just 2-0'd navi... but you're right man they suck

651872,overwatch is already out of beta duhh
651877,"look, another content patch like 6.1!"
651926,because playing video games is trully a sport

652032,cause that picture is never used on steam
652036,"here, i think you might've dropped this back there:"
652100,"but if the stick is as big as a lamppost, is getting the short end of the stick still that bad?"
652145,it is but judging by the downvotes must be hard to tell
652150,"til: optimization doesn't exist, and xbox uses pc gameplay footage in their trailers."
652156,people love that though i thought this is what the wow players wanted?
652216,just like they aren't ignorant of the fact that sandbox mode increases toxicity right?
652222,probably because tahm kench allows kennen to ult his ally anivia if she is killed by garen
652263,"hello, my name is green jesus, and welcome to blizzcon."
652308,aren't we all friendless neckbeards?

652368,"or... hear me out here, i might sound a bit crazy since riot is a new company but what if they have two servers, one in portland and one in chicago!"
652371,that's why every riven main is diamond and everybody who plays the champion gets to diamond instantly.
652385,can someone quickly tell me who he is or do i need to watch the 40min video?
652400,yeah remilia really showed how bad she was a thresh tonight.
652419,yea cuz i'll just rush a site and do the exact same thing and it'll work in lem
652455,"its simple, you go a and rotate through ct to b foolproof"
652548,"we would also add back in hybridization of specs and unique builds for casual play, but i guess blizzard just caters to the hardcore"
652561,but if they remove crit then people won't believe that wildturtle is the best adc na and won't lose to the evil chinese and koreans
652656,yeah launching new gpus two weeks before the end of q2 really shoulda saved them
652658,how the is it ironic you baddie ...sorry

652813,"yeah how dare clg fans want to celebrate winning a very competitive lcs split, don't they know tsm is better because they won in the past?"
652863,"there are so many champions with grievous wounds though, just play one of them."
652870,"sorry for your wasted time, i forgot"
652871,its not like most players know how to play their champs or game at all
652886,"they aren't ruining the gameplay experience, they just had a bad day."
652888,"yeah, i wonder why people wouldn't want to trust people that fixes matches for their own gain."
652897,"let's upload only one screenshot with no explanation or footage whatsoever, so that more people come play the game."
652907,"yeah, deilor played those last few games way better than reignover."
652911,whelp i guess rush can't play tanks
652954,"you bastard, why would you take mid from the poor guy."
652962,"of course not, rank is all that matters"
652964,"add the nice people you meet, never solo queue again"
652972,yeah so riot can have even more influence on this subreddit.
652982,another sign of cs:go becoming more ct sided
653044,i am instantly persuaded by your irrefutable argument.
653062,but then you have a chance to get the real scar
653077,"one person said something he disagrees with and one person is a minority of all the people who play, therefore loud minority."
653113,"pirating is bad, mmkay, and even if the developer is abuse, being a pirate means your bad, mmkay."
653126,"duh, it means widely augmented reality game."

660881,they're with faker saying stop it.
660892,"on the bright side, y'all console gamer get to bug-for us."

661931,"i think he's making a joke, but people have become used to"
661975,you're right.. it's so much better when psn dies.
662689,yeah the sub is definitely much better when literally the first two pages are nothing but esports shit.
662795,i've never seen anything more balanced in my life and i'm a trapeze artist.
663107,i want the satisfaction of getting that b out of my game
663110,but having so much stuff in his kit allows for him to outplay champions with basic kits!
663135,"sorry, i don't talk to 170 karma scrubs."
663174,because this totally wasn't average 6 months ago.
663291,"yeah, his name is probably 4chan."
663648,yes but no one saw it because it was banned from the subreddit
663814,shhh...only nintendo has unique and unconforming games.

663954,i wish it was ubi making this and not bethesda
664009,green is my favorite color as well.
664093,my whole week is ruined now thanks to you
664113,yeah all the moba games that are being made after the success of lol and dota 2 are all made for our enjoyment and not attempts to get as popular and big as lol and dota 2 for maximum profit!
664219,"yeah, people shouldn't be allowed to want to buy things that are appealing to them"

665066,no i dont suck my team is just trash

665165,"yeah, this reviewer gave this one game a slightly lower score then other outlets, he must be biased"
665174,gotta reheat dem muscle memories man
665257,maybe that's just because you were raised on nintendo..
665289,"the could also have recruited steeelback for that job, since he was adc for the number 1 team eu and is curently residing in na"
665305,obviously the adc for clg would get that many viewers
665355,this clearly wearing baggy clothing should mean that getting shot in the baggy parts means you die
665405,yeah lack of games people wanted wasn't a factor at all.
665511,this is just pr to make up for azubu's scandal!

666700,"get a more higher-end ultra computer, op"
666826,"yeah, because games are no fun unless they look like real life and you play with an elitist attitude."
666873,"you're right, because the ap kat will always be better than the ad yasuo in the same comp."
666891,"yeah, cause people don't kill everyone randomly enough as it is..."
666917,leona is an ap assassin wtf u talking about

667520,i think that they might have seen your awp skin and committed suicide.
667531,"i get what you are saying, but at the same time with how most of the storm troopers aim i doubt they used their sights, so maybe for the startwars universe it *would* have been more realistic not to be able to aim."

667592,"he's just a pro who knows the spray patterns, seems legit."

668212,"yeah, i'm sure everyone would bitch if realms came up early..."
668216,yes because nerfing healing is a good thing

668398,suomi finland boys the vitun dream
668410,can we put it on 30 frames so it will be more cinematic

668428,keep the game exactly as it is?
668465,right because people don't play games using microprocessors ever...
668491,naw mayne jatt is dumb and he thought the crowd was booing the guys choice of ringtone.
668499,"if you slow it down, you can see he's snappin onto the person in banana while turning"
668575,because a blue katowice sticker looks great on a redline?
668591,all the silvers that think they should be higher
668636,but i worked so hard to be in the beta
668698,oh i've never heard this song in a csgo video.

669043,riot will now ban your account for hackings
669048,maybe that'll give playstation time to make the logitech wheels work
669082,"kids shouldn't be playing m rated games, this is the parents fault"
669110,obviously americans are the only racist people in the world so it has to be them
669124,"easy, take all his kills to increase your k:d."
669131,because if we liked communicating with people we wouldn't be sinking time in game hidden behind virtual avatars.
669133,"nah man, the fact that i could pick tf and clear the whole jungle with no pots was balanced."
669195,"yes, because there are so many different top awpers living in stockholm!"
669197,in ten years all games will be picture books
669202,haha he only kills drones with it though!
669211,and i'll change to thresh adc just to counter your leona
669264,but surely if people upvote his post then that means they like him and want to be his friend!
669329,"yeah really, what an angry statement."

669413,"nah, peope will play intro bots"
669424,google knows more about lol than riot
669425,it might break rp sales cuz of rito coding
669460,yet again poor non toxic player gets punished.

669872,inb4 round 3: can you name all 123 champions by their e ability and round 4: can you name all 123 champions by their r ability
669881,"but there's no profit loss, so it's okay!"
669902,"i didn't realize you had a phd in economics and we were discussing the finer points of capitalism, my mistake."

670074,"ofc he should, how else is he going to kill their adc that is attacking our tank and killing him?"
670090,"damn game developers, trying to make money off of entertainment!"

670168,ya cuz heimerdonger can have unlimited turrets right?
670285,he's get unbanned instantly obviously.
670325,yeah so many people defending them here...
670346,yes because there is no way a human could do this.
670553,"no dude you cant point that out, shes a person but pros are robots and need to be held to higher standards"
670554,because tsm can never be wrong and dyrus has never shown to lack intelligence before
671699,"didnt you know that vp is known for being absolute online beasts and always lower their level in the big tournaments because of choke, was even more like that in the old days in 1.6"
671735,"forgiven saying this things, he wants to get killed by the mob."

671915,"yeah, just a teensy little understatement"
672147,"but, i want the games at 12.01 am!"
672229,"oh gee, a polygon article... i am hinging on its every word."
672255,its actually a dishonoured sequel set in the capital wasteland

672641,cant wait for the day valve adds a block communication buttom
672686,half life 1 episode 3 confirmed ?
672711,"as we all know that console professional players are better than pc, only the topmost ranks of silver i-sem were included in the console version the lower ranks from ge-gn1 were discarded because on consoles, they were always empty"
672712,"just put four of them in sli, nothing beats them in performance/price"
672949,caitlyn finally counters sivir now..
673039,"i was being sarcastic, for got the"
673061,please take this down as it is an exploit that will give us a competitive advantage.
673106,"yes, and league is completely non-habit forming, just like squares..."
673107,"yeah, they moved that games to the gc, the big games, surely now they haven't anything for the biggest event of the year, even if phil spencer said that they have a lot of content..."
673163,"hey man, team liquid was purposely throwing games to make piglet look bad so piglet wouldn't get team offers"
673214,2 wins in a row and you can be a gambit coach too
673242,"you're right, i'll start working on my meme game in order to properly call myself baylife."
673264,"obviously spread , git gud newb"
673268,"yes, if someone goes 0/10 they are permanently banned and may never play again with all their hundreds/thousands spent on account lost."
673319,this video should be removed due to massive amounts of personality and league related humor being displayed.
673339,but the more people he scams with the closed alpha the better!
673404,"ikr bloodborne on the pc is much better, it's like it's loading times are non existent!"
673469,releasing a new system to ban toxic players
673606,everyone knows you cant cheat because of vac
673658,yeah it's not like people make tons of accounts for no reason anyway
673724,time to give esea another chance
673773,and there died my hype for batman arkham knight!
673776,"no, the insane is another achievement and, now, takes probably less time."
673777,"yeah right, i keep forgetting how many spells dpriests now can use to heal."
673800,are you prepared to play galio jungle with runeglaive?
673807,yea they could definitely learn a lesson from 343 and the master chief collection!
673808,whelp time to return batman and break my xbox one there's no way i can enjoy it at 900p.
673837,"well, they *are* reading kotaku."
673864,plot twist: the pc comes with a video card that doesn't fit into it's tiny case.
673873,but the human eye can't see above 24 frames per second
673874,and industrial in no way has anything to do with music...
673945,i think he's talking about the gummy bears dude..
673952,dyrus said lol noobs after that incoming ritoban?
673988,im sure everyone in skt earns the same as faker and everyone gets the same from the azubu streaming
673991,yet another way that they mimic minecraft
674008,"ohh, in eu are those poles non existent or do they see through them or something?"
674067,as always gp10 with their deeper analysis anf understanding of stats
674113,but now you can kill 2 minions with 1 q (assuming you don't miss since now it's a skill shot).
674130,you mean to tell me that you didn't like jak x?
674310,it scales off of ad hard though!
674357,"yeah, it's a real shame you can't play old versions after a newer new comes out."
674399,thanks for the useful suggestion
674427,ask them to line up and fire 10 bullets penetrating them all
674522,well this looks like a very thought out and productive argument here and nothing like a i just lost to champ x so it must be op thread
674569,junglers need to get more responsible!
674579,yes and nicktron is gonna play in his place.
674590,instant mute + report for using 6400dpi or something
674669,"clearly his many subs, views, likes, and supporters are all fooled."
674699,"wow, i wasn't aware that girls play video games"
674795,it's an inferno...xbox should be shut down
674816,that 40 damage gonna be hurtful
674833,because gta is like the bestest thing of all bestness and those stupid pc games don't have it yet because they are stupid.
674917,new briefcase particles on ult wooow so hype.
674956,lol yeah replacing wildturtle with rekkles would be greattt
674976,"obviously every person who has more money than me has got there through cheating or being a dick, my procrastination and lack of effort is completely not to blame."
675029,"no, a good developer is someone that puts replays in their game, without replays nothing can be good!"
675082,why can't they just play dust 2 every match?
675099,why are people using ts and mumble instead of skype?
675142,because its totally fun having a knife round win the pro games
675172,"nice try scarra, go back to poaching on skype."
675188,but the reboot cant be good because dante and virgil look different
675212,silvers r so bad amirite everyone?
675213,all of the rito pls posts contain the best ideas so league would of course be amazing!
675250,but op minecraft is violent and causes kids to massacre sheep and pigs all over the world!
675260,what a great way to give constructive criticism
675285,but...but... you can't photoshop a video
675324,"makes sense.after all,i can just spot players headglitching at pit at first glance,without concentrating,and tracking them is as easy as could get."
675385,"i mean if you can't afford a ferrari by your second paycheck you should probably rethink your whole life, right?"
675417,"i'm sure you would enjoy playing a game with nothing but dev textured greyboxes, with yellow and blue capsules."
675466,yeah i heard summit is flat broke
675534,dude regi never benches everyone even if they suck
675538,"yeah, his season 4 was so good too!"
675553,"yeah, i mean obviously the only weapon that needs a buff is the ump-45."
675604,yeah his attack speed is what made him viable.
675634,"pfff just level swimming its, its sooo useful."
675652,yeah... they'll totally just scrap the entire project because of a reddit post.
675702,"drug trafficking, musketeering, blazing it, tweaking, and swag and/or yolo."
675716,apparently you can take gifts back if people don't use them for a while...
675717,dota obviously needs source 2 more.
675760,but what if i didn't know that there's usually a ct awper watching mid?
675768,"too bad all of reddit is challenger, so we don't need to get boosted!"
675849,that map and cs_assault are really well balanced and fun.
675911,they should have given the game for free on ea access!
675963,"yeah who cares if it looks, sounds or feels like star wars"
675964,we should make a skype group where we post all their videos so we can downvote them!
675995,that is some ifunny stuff and the mods would delete this anyways because it's not leagues related
676031,maybe he's *really* terrified of flying.
676051,"right he got carried by koreans to challenger, makes alot of sense"
676075,"free markets never work, we need government interference!"
676090,"shame on you gabe giving a cut to those modders for the hours they spend for those mods they build,when we could have all that stuff for free."
676094,yeah and dyrus is the best top laner in the world
676129,"no, you are an extraordinary case"
676142,allu brings his friends to a party.
676153,"silver game sense, over hypes everything, doesn't let the other caster get a word in, gets all the callouts wrong but yeah apart from that he is great"
676171,"it's 975 ip because ip is worth less than rp, duhhh."
676178,"nope pretty sure its just you, otherwise we would have a lot more posts about this"
676187,but then they would have to actually work on the code
676189,"nah man, you don't need 3d, 2d is where it's at, dawg."
676230,change status message to ''offline''
676270,i identify as 19-kin and i'm so triggered right now.
676306,"how dare you not just give him an entire spec, glyph, itemization priority and rotation to be a 35k dps rogue, especially after how much he has given you!"
676353,idk if it has already been said but: kioshima
676419,"needs more louder music, maybe some bloom effects too and slow mo with camera spinning"
676474,yeah my fiddlesticks jungle is hurting without my as rune page.
676503,"yeah, they're being real original and funny with these comments"
676510,but how will people know in the trashtalk thread the day before.
676515,"cause obviously if you have worked around blizzard at any point, you have to be a spy planted to destroy riot cause blizzard is master race."
676534,thx for the warlock and rogue nerfs.
676567,haha yeah we all know that feeling of stealing baron with fiddle e yeah such a good feeling
676622,"the kind, thoughtful, supportive player community"
676679,it's also very amusing to see these posts constantly.
676729,"he said it was professional, so *obviously* that makes it the most professional channel out there!"
676749,false it would be pirated so many copies amirite guyz
676751,yeah banning half of na's top players would really help the scene grow
676762,maybe if you received a good yelling or two your guild wouldn't be wiping!
676863,oh hey a german premade... how unexpected
676935,we could just solder cables to reestablish the connections
677047,"wow yeah that _does_ sound expensive, now that i think about it!"
677090,"true, not everyone can play a braindead blink-in-and-mash-keys champ."
677099,yes impact is a noob cause he died in a 1v4
677108,but they are not 3 - 0 are they?
677130,but he's only using megabits dude
677210,then i want to toggle between all colors of the rainbow with my arcade hecarim d:
677216,people with so much luck as you should be chained up and beaten with a baseball bat.
677239,"um yea i lost a bunch of skins too, return them to me op"
677272,shh don't talk about talon the damage is gone
677281,because virginity is such a big deal.
677282,but its my teammates fault i'm in dmg.
677296,"pls hurry, the chicken ai sucks now, and it's really gamebreaking."
677361,"do it in deathmatch, where awpers are accepted and revered"
677421,"friberg's got his ps4, it doesn't matter."
677432,"i was joking buddy, i just forgot to add the"
677502,the autos hit faster when in melee range so it's necessary for that max dps
677504,"this looks like a totally original idea, just like every game king makes!"
677520,"he's bringing out the big guns there, gamereactor norwa, that changes my mind completely"
677587,"it's not that surprising, the map is beta after all."
677628,sorry to clog up your pristine r/ps4 feed.
677630,"because the mildly overweight, jersey accent, homeless heroine addict girl from infamous last light wasn't interesting or a fresh change at all."
677731,i doubt your team mates would be interested in nudes from someone 2 years old
677750,i have objections; if i can't afford it no one else is allowed to afford it
677758,"just hope this gets sorted before the faire ends, it shouldn't be that hard to fix something that they know was bugged since beta.."
677772,wow man what the heck why are you so offensive on the internet?
677794,well that was completely surpising -.-
677809,"hey everyon, lets downvote the opinion to hell!"
677839,"too good for cereal box games, mister moneybags?"
677849,yes because pre-rework nidalee and soraka were the definition of interactive champions that had many layers of play
677869,from almost getting 3-0'd by curse academy in relegtions to winning worlds... yeah seems realistic
677898,*video games aren't sexist at all*!
677909,he totally said virus **witch**
677959,i know the obvious awnser is wow
677977,"such a new idea, never heard of it"
677989,"because it's not zomgpeeerrrfect, and anything less than that is just not worth playing."
677999,yeah we shouldn't be allowed opinions on such trivial things.
678040,they prove that spending 2 years on it was worth it
678074,"a two hour queue along with the inability to enter your garrison or any instance successfully, without it taking you 30mins of constant trial and error each time you try to do it is surely reasonable."
678076,because having sub challenger people in charge of who gets to play who is the best idea.
678088,"thanks for that, couldn't tell what he was saying otherwise"
678099,because more is always better.
678113,i got some news for you: you missed the invisible
678137,double krugs for blue side and gromp for purple... great...
678167,*fun for skrubl0rdz who don't even mlg mtn dew doritos
678218,this here just might convince me to go back to console
678226,only 90s kids can browse reddit.

680850,ikr i mean all you have to do there is point and click
680915,yellowstar is known for his leona lol
681244,horses still looked better in beta.
681320,"if it didnt load for all, the game wont start and the person who didnt loaded in time will be banned from league ... easy as that"
681355,gtx 980 ti is just a cheap rebrand of the titan x.
681363,look guys i found a new lol player!
681366,"silly you, xbox potato can't get 60fps if you want 1080p quality"

683867,"thank god, i thought riot games was the next nsa"
683893,it literally breaks the game and makes the game unplayable

692552,"wow, you're very unbiased in the title post"
692571,"no, lee sin, rengar, j4, and vi killing everyone and shutting down other junglers - as well as the jungle being hard and frustrating - that is what is *best for all of us*."
692577,rip xwx... top 1 in our hearts.
692580,"haha, i thought about comic sans..."
692593,shouldnt be playing games while driving...
692627,"of course it is, we hate link so he deserves to be reported for having a bad game, but we like alex so he can have bad games whenever he wants and we'll make excuses for him"
692628,just buff other junglers instead of nerfing lee and j4.
692629,"i think lol would be better if they changed it to league of ancients, and if they added turn rates, then it would be better"
692641,"yea, due to his vast experience and success against the best teams in the world..."
692679,"what are you talking about, reddit is the most direct line of communication to riot hq and everything league related."
692695,"you're probably right we shouldn't care what they do or express our opinion on it, because they probably don't look for our opinions anyways."
692696,but what about melee classes that don't use mana?
692700,"everyone dont buy it, so it will be ours forever!"
692803,"but guys, my console is just as powerful as most computers!"
692815,awp is spelled wrong it a-u-p xd
692902,i think it is because he has his skins back
692954,"but now the slow doesnt cost mana, so good"

693362,but let's still blame sony yay!
693379,b-but.. i hate picture posts so everyone else does and that's because there are no text posts ever in this subreddits.

693585,"you mean to say there is more than just immolate, conflagarate, chaos bolt then spamming incinerate whilst never moving for the rest of the fight?"

693670,did you try password and 12345 as the log ins?

693944,it was secretly snax to trick the ddosers
693971,remember to set your desktop to 256 color mode before starting games that support rich 256 color mode.
694019,that's the way to go after your major ban!
694021,just give me a couple months...
694032,"yeah, adc is most mechanical, they need to land their skillshots perfectly on at least 3 people because after using their abilities they become useless"
694043,ya and with recount and skada meters ingame
694068,"meh... missed the quickscope on 4th guy, terrorists giving you all the 1v1s."
694072,but i want the bot's m249 goddammit.
694142,"but those are coded as minions, duh!"
694168,"there's no fucking way you can break half of a cpu or gpu yes, because you can't break pins, bend pcb's, or any more mechanical damage (like breaking sockets, etc)."
694177,those filthy euros hate na because we're back to back world war champions
694182,because sacrificing 20% of your health for a spell shouldnt make it more powerful than spending 130 mana to jump on your pole
694209,ur right we need more dank maymays in cs xd
694215,double jeopardy so it cancels out.
694225,i wish more people would post the spam they get on their console
694232,you run out of mana after using two spells
694269,"just lifting his mouse a lot, nothing unusual."
694278,you should play ride to hell retribution for a blast from the past
694310,"but those people never existed , like the coaching sessions that g2 had ."
694311,he must have forgotten that your opinion is everyone's opinion
694323,playing all these games made you swear too much !
694334,"once again, reddit knows everything."
694339,oh you are really evil person taking houses from everybody's moms!

694378,such a waste being able to place a trinket like 4000 units away
694391,"built it in survival, or didn't build it at all."
694404,because they totally didn't give at least an option to use any headset either.
694406,yes lee sin is so broken as evidenced by his low skill ceiling amazing scaling into late game and innate cc and tankiness!
694474,what a joke every team has a toxic player
694477,30 since nobody needs more than 30fps
694507,i've been waiting for custom smoke colors for ages!
694510,'cause men can't be raped/harrassed
694526,"yeah, i mean he's already mentally alienated from the team, we should definitely physically alienate him too that would be good"
694531,the shit they experience in mm will probably make them hate us even more.
694538,"obviously, they said they are serious."
694548,good thing darius kept the team meta or you might have lost
694570,this is america; the only people who deserve comfortable wages are the oligarchs at the top.
694579,they also lost crumbzz and cruzer but we dont talk about them anyway
694597,"op slow reactions, can't blame gaem"
694647,can't handle an innocent april fools joke
694660,"nuh uh op is constantly stuck with bad teammates and 64 tick, he should be global but he's stuck in nova 4"
694664,they need to get the peggle 2 guy
694665,your opinion is irrelevant i'm afraid.
694666,"yeah cnc really teaches you how to physically manipulate metal, really lets you get the hands on experience !"
694685,"yeah, because that game was such a *humongous* success on the n64..."
694710,"i don't know man, the name *heart of the swarm* doesn't make any sense for a moba."
694717,yeah i guess that makes anivia broken since she makes darius ult unable to reset
694735,keep it in; finally gives trynd meaningful counterplay
694764,woah dude thats wayyy too complicated for me...
694773,"yorick removed from league, both players refunded"

694878,man what insightful and totally correct insight into the complex process of designing champions
694879,"i know right, that j4 splash is one of the worst things i've ever seen"
694915,"yeah, it must be the 100 frames per second that you get in game that is holding you back in dmg"
694930,still dont understand why cant just all speak a common language in
694988,yea because d1 is so bad amirite
694990,"well, with the perfect vote system in the usa, it sure counts."
694991,"oh shit, now his argument is completely invalid"
695022,i wouldn't know because i didn't get to gold because of all the ragers and feeders.

695072,"wow, abusing of rengar bugs isn't enough, now impaler needs to abuse ga!"
695131,his english has really improved
695135,"yeah, i'm sure we're hurting the walton family a lot"
695156,monte wasn't getting enough shit already
695159,can maokai pull out a blunt at 4:20 gametime
695166,"oh yeah, there's no problems in how women are portrayed/modeled in games at all."
695178,gotta love all those jump scares.
695180,wow these memes just get funnier and funnier eh guys
695188,maybe there are some nice guides written down over at the warlizard gaming forums
695201,it would be so much better because they would make a new one every 6 months and then you could sync your life to it and grow a neck beard and learn to knit and brew your own craft beer and be sooo trendy it hurts
695204,i know how could somebody not know something?
695217,he finnaly got boosted to where he deserved only to realize his teammates are now holding him back even more.
695256,because one lan turns you into the best player in na.
695267,"hey nerd take the silencer off, now its same gun"
695277,"false, op played 4 games on gragas, malphite, and graves back in season 2."
695281,"because we can't have good posts on the front page, it must be filled with people who went to worlds getting master"
695287,"yes, because of all the bugs in wod, this is the top priority."
695326,"but they're not in fnatic, so it's ok."
695335,wow i didn't know q procs off of q
695366,i am going to be honest and say i have never played it... but the game is pretty dumb just by looking at it.
695389,"yeah sure,we are getting naruto after releasing the new goku champion and luffy meanwhile we are at it,why not also release every chinese cartoon character has an champion too?"
695391,u basterd its the pirates fault the game had glitches dont you know they'll be the death of pc gaming
695409,"ooo no kids would find out about porn, its not like the internet isn't full of children 10+ who know and watch porn."
695433,yeah he should bought one of those awesome pre-built pc's instead!
695449,and thank god for that i dont think the world could handle so much goodness before exploding
695468,go and buy music kits instead of asking for useless updates
695526,yeah because unchained was not at all pretty much his base skin.
695539,women are rendered with 78% less pixels than men in the game obviously
695540,"wow, if only they could come up with a rating system and have it utilize an age system."
695550,first time i've heard that one!
695569,nobody has ever done anything good in the world without being christian.
695588,well maybe if you paid for a beta and reported those bugs and crashes then you wouldn't have that problem.
695600,"well, obviously we can't judge because it's a 16 tick demo."
695639,you get more with regular... buy that one
695654,"exactly, that's why you can put pegs on top of the pegs."
695662,i'm sure pro players are pro players because they spend all of their time playing vs people several tiers of skill below them
695698,look at the amazing ground texture in the second one.
695743,yes cause oklahoma is landlocked
695787,"nah it totally means they're slacking off, dev effort is proportional to features released."
696782,yaaay more 2d side scrollers
696819,"yeah, fizz was never a viable option for competitive play."
696820,"i mean, i don't know where you got that idea, he hasn't ever done anything like that in the past."
697010,just like we saw how good honor system worked
697261,who cares about drophackers and scripters as long as people who say gg ez are getting banned for toxicism
697308,3v3 challenger is worth so much :\^)
697321,they could've said it at least four times.
697374,because faze clan is accepting applications?
697417,"give me your license plate and i can tell you your full name, birthday, ssn, ip address and your favorite pizza topping."
697460,"oh yeah that actually makes a lot of sense, maybe australians are all good people"
697500,"yeah lee totally kicked her out of lee's q, jinx's zap, ekko's q."
697571,"he's getting free armor and magic resist at levels 1/6/11/16, what he really needs, right?"
697648,i am sworn to carry your burdens
697835,fucking flair smurfs ruining the integrity of this sub
697850,nope tes doesn't have numbers just letters and a subtitle.
697853,because she definitely beats the likes of zed and fizz
697864,yes cause you code this kind of things as a self inflicted damage instead of input damage modifiers
698122,so the only conclusion is that being perma-locked is obviously more fun than being hit by a point&amp;click ability
698210,yeah i bet the multiplayer on this game is way dead now
698245,because netherrack in a bedrock layer is totally not obvious in any way
698433,clearly hacks even csgo points it out
698434,"your aim just sucks, you shot through his balaclava, aim for his chest instead where is head is located."
698543,"he is getting a new skin next patch, thats some serious attention"
698567,it's animus that's bugging not the actual game
698607,"it's clearly fake, madagascar would've closed everything ages ago."
698654,but...but mah ap/ad bruiser off-tank evelynn neeeds it!
698657,no it's only a sign of a champ being broken when it works in my favor
698711,"...that was totally intentional, i swear!"
698766,"yeah, i always hoped fallout would be a bit more like the sims..."
698804,yea cause we all know how fast updates happen in dota
698805,your knowledge is so huge what you are saying makes so much sense
698849,yes because the people that develop the new client and replay system are the same people that make skins.
698856,and being cancelled all of less than a week from release should make everyone super excited and pumped about buying the halo 5 statue
698919,"no, it's a kingdom hearts reference"
698967,thats why it was such a huge game esports wise
698971,why dont they just release replays instead and you could still see all that info
698985,you can.. for $20 a month and at a maximum 720p output with shotty lag and audio quality.
699013,"no, i'm sure everyone was a saint at 17."
699081,nah he's just phoon on his smurf
699124,"he probably just found a cure for it, that no doctor has been able to find yet."
699140,"yay i'm glad we got another support, the true heroes of league of legends!"
699142,obviously nvidia have crippled every card available to sell more of their next architecture.
699181,yeh getting raged at by ppl who are also potentially dmg is a great way to become a professional player
699219,hope you have 14 days worth of things you can do.
699246,"nazis are baddies and scums of the earth, they deserve it."
699264,but he's global that means he's always right.
699370,it's because of all the hackers
699378,"good thinking, better give it back to alister too."
699397,i mean good thing you were aiming for their knees when turning that corner
699427,"yeah because in comp everybody just rushes through smoke, bhopping with their knife out."
699451,not viable because you need a jump throw script
699455,"because a metroid game on the wiiu is for sure, absolutely not coming in the future confirmed"
699460,"riot being assholes , news to me"
699464,good to see riot is using their resources well
699465,but its all about the deeps brah!
699469,and sona players are too busy rolling their face on their keyboard to aim it anyway
699551,"can we shut up with that dude like seriously, your 11th birthday party is a big deal"
699570,or how about get a replay system amirite guys?
699690,"yes, because as we all know *only* males can be attracted to women."
699861,"it's more cinematic, of course!"
699879,but... but... rito promised me voice chat... and they haven't given it to me yet... injustice
699883,"zed such a toxic assassin, better change his kit even though it's one of the best designed kits in the game"
699892,because they're quirky and original thinkers!
699895,"i'm s2 but i'd be ge 100% if no hackers, russians, smurfs and bad teammates."
699961,"right, he just hated cloud9 in their first split"
699966,approximately the length of one season of game of thrones.
700012,"instalock, say nothing, than go to the lane you want"
700040,he's truly embracing how clg use their top laners
700112,circlejerks are only bad if you disagree with the premise.
700147,"yeah, isn't it generally accepted that everyone playing in the premier league is british?"
700197,yeah because shouting buying rune scimitar on end is sooo fun.
700209,wow cool stuff from when we were kids.
700235,there are too many 3d games coming out lately.
700261,"yeah lol, lot's of gamers don't realize it's wireless till they drop their controllers."
700298,"dude, that's a 3v1, stop lying for the karma!"
700363,sounds like someone's looking for a slap
700381,if she couldn't it would be bad game mechanics.
700427,"but maybe if he was warned, he would've stepped up his game!"
700474,because im 11 and know more than you
700553,itt: a bunch of alliance ninnies who want the law to be upheld.
700556,"c'mon, this is the internet, where its zero suit samus cosplays or nothing."
700572,"but he needs kills to get money it's clearly your fault he only has a bf sword 18 mins in you totally stole that one kill from him, and because of that he can't snowball."
700593,your edgy memes are on point today
700620,because the whole point of triforce is for the proc not for the 3.5k worth of stats it gives
700651,but you can't connect a pc to tv!
700656,"play katarina, you can win games using your forehead."
700669,"huh, who would've thought that wouldn't be any fun?"
700722,i deserve to be supreme it's just my shit teammates keep making me lose
700749,you forgot to add *x-post from r/creepy*.
700750,"oh yeah, people can't be sexist or racist anymore so that means the fall of the empire is on the way."
700858,"yeah, we need to buff their range and mobility further..."
700891,"yeah, stomping low level dudes for like 200 or so games 'till you're lvl 30 is so fun, both for us and for them..."
700915,yeah poor zlatan i really hope he wins a title before he retires
700919,"oh no you see it's still in beta, so once the pros get involved there will be much more complex strategies, and blizzard has tons of money to invest into esports so it will have a huge competitive scene"
700962,i am gonna go use over 9000 proxies to get hyperdeminsion neptunia in sm4sh
700970,that toss stick combo is a toughy.
701010,"don't be silly, its not like individual mod bias or opinion could influence a decision based around intent, something completely circumstantial and entirely based on interpretation with no evidence to support it."
701018,come on dude... he carried the mod team
701052,because the next price up for a stack is always almost double.
701067,"you're right, we should nerf every weapon that can do crazy clutches."
701092,so that's how you stop getting ganked top lane.
701102,yeah cos mods are actually the spawn of satan
701108,"yea, i think he needs kalista passive."
701114,doesn't count because it was done in 128 tick
701117,"yeah, sneaky is such a terrible lucian player."
701119,"did you adjust for inflation, old timer?"
701138,"yeah, but he can't have as much fun doing those as he is picking on people who have a harder time fighting back."
701146,because twitch chat is full of challenger players offering *extremely high quality* analysis of the game
701147,prob because the best csgo teams are from sweden so by default they are better than you
701205,you don't understand - he did it *ironically*
701217,delays are for downgrading purposes only
701218,"the good times when keys were 2.66 ref... the good times... oh, and when valve actually watered the potted plant but whatever"
701242,"oh boy, pure touchscreen controls here we come!"
701253,it's because he's polish amirite
701261,"i got you buddy, you dropped this"
701276,he needs the gold to refresh dem elixirs
701303,nah man cinderhulk is definitely a good item and isn't unhealthy at all
701371,"nah son, go hella hard or go hella home!"
701401,but blizzard has gold for usd now :\^)
701457,"34 dislikes, must be the skype group at it, again."

701551,"yeah, that's the point of the photo."
701576,"welcome the league of cinderhulk where 5k hp is the bare minimum, unless you're an adc; cause fuck you."
701578,thinking that the name of the guns on the main menu don't matter is why you're a double ak.
701627,because the build for sup kha is super set in stone as a meta pick right?
701631,"seriously there are no bad reviews of broken age, provide links"
701634,"uh, you normally should call gg after losing the pistol round."
701652,"he still has the same uptime on his shield, so he will still block the same one aa he did before this change, except now he will have his shield up less in lane, so it will be easier to harass him, but its k because he has an extra 40 hp shield for 1 sec late game"
701664,this will keep me away from reaching challenger...
701685,they are working on steam customer support
701731,because we all know apm requirement = skill requirement
701761,"but the media keeps telling me that console gaming is dead, in favor of mobile gaming!"
701784,"ye, they clearly removed it from youtube..."
701790,"quality post, hope this makes it to the front page."
701877,no you should play everything in order all the time
701953,"silly rengar, everyone knows there are no girls that play league!"

702031,"should have just used attack-move, duhhh"
702043,the reliable servers and great response time when fixing bugs!
702061,i love how i can see the eye of sauron from everywhere on the map and use it as a reference point to navigate.
702071,boy oh boy those elise buffs sure are gonna help win games.
702073,"b...but it's nintendo, they don't even care about money!"
702167,that's nice and all but where is the original japanese cover?
702240,"omg he was nr1 challenger in singapore , definately the best soloq player"
702284,yeah all kinds of dlc content is literally satan and never reasonable!
702290,still hardly more expensive than a gcc adaptor...
702343,you aren't allowed to have fun until you tryhard your way to challenger like the rest of us.
702398,"quick let's start a rumor about how the beta is gonna start on the 28th, everyone loves those!"
702413,"we also know the langues, jewish and islamic."
702449,its so he can fix matches easier.
702450,don't worry its in beta it'll get fixed in 2016
702457,so this is what riot's been doing instead of making a new champion
702459,he is just lifting his mouse dude you are probably silver lol
702499,sounds like a reputable source.
702518,"when you think about it, it's a wonder how steel and moe get along."
702553,"yeah, so sad for steel, he is the victim here."
702558,maybe that's why the odds were so close
702563,"so lets set the precedent that if you're involved in match fixing in professional csgo if you're under 18 when you do it i guess it's alright and you can get unbanned because you don't know any better, makes sense to me."
702575,doing sarcasm over text is easy as fuck.
702585,"nah, they can just afford a on of adspace with the lack of money they are making"
702594,goddamn you guys being all reasonable making us look like idiots with pitchforks ---e
702612,"dying light, dayz, h1z1, dead island 2, the walking dead, dead rising 3, the evil within, the last of us remastered... i don't know what you mean."
702633,but reddit taught me to always ask for a refund

702665,oh yea the tanky dps mage assassin bruiser support jungler burst carry needs buffs
702710,it's fine he clearly just minified his code
702722,doesn't help that a bunch of misogynist pigs stopped playing her because she covered her midriff.
702738,well that just goes to show you how well optimized the game is
702762,"this means all those game producers are from the left wing, fuckin communists."
702769,yeah waiting 50mn to 3h20 is totally not a punishment
702794,"yeah, cause there are so many to chose from."
702809,"yeah, don't they know we have a sub full of professionals here?"
702812,maybe it's the world's first quantum gpu?
702825,"move the fuck over, sliced bread."
702845,thats because every global is just a hacking or second account anyways
702856,making your radar scale smaller is cheating too because it lessens the required skill and map knowledge
702922,"yeah, luckily we're paying now for psn so they have been able to deliver better performance on their network"
702925,"yeah, who cares about the people that actually enjoyed those games."
702929,"its illidan in disguise, he has come to get the skull of guldan because black temple was...merely a setback."

703249,this video was so sexist and misogynistic
703254,"don't lie, we all know that nightblue never makes mistakes, it's always his shitty team who make him lose"
703345,"well, reddit *does* know balance!"
703349,windwall is the highest skill cap mechanic in the game wtf?
703353,"no this is not normal, you have girlfriend."
703361,"exactly, saying that your team is shit will definitely help you win."

703368,"no dude, didn't you see how impressive he was, leading his team into relegations ?"
703373,"why don't give the jungle treatment, if its on a 3rd party bot, maybe it should be live?"

703491,they could just code teammates as minions until they connect!
703495,its too bad dunkey's voice isn't real though.
703502,somehow he is still d2... i guess he got lucky?
703503,operation: suppresive fire adds 5 new lmgs and 2 pump shotguns.
703514,i'm sure you'd make a great pro counter strike player with your ability to see enemies from a gotv spectator pov and hindsight.
703537,this is why koreans don't stream coz they become weak
703542,your feedback was helpful and constructive.
703543,can't have one small joke... \*cries*
703549,yes because gta iv was actually really bad
703557,"yeah lets just stop with community feedback, everyone just needs to adapt to whatever happends, right."
703565,and your eyes can't see over 24fps either
703570,confirmed that the hltv list that just randomly named a few pros with good results recently is true.
703580,those dell small form factors pack a punch
703583,because mcc is the only good game for it
703610,"omg i cant this offseason anymore, my heart"
703638,ya and add third person view so we can stare at its ass!
703658,cause obviously syndra pressing q and r and one shooting the enemy adc is more difficult than draven
703663,he tested on sf's main account.
703665,"it's fine really, i always rush sightstone and deepward the enemy jungle so if he ever shows up i always have time to put on the tether preemptively i don't remember missing the slow in crucial moments either, guess im just that good"
703680,i think you're the only one who had that :/
703804,iirc he said that he only plays with cheap price skins such as skt or 520 rp things..
703885,so that's why froggen didn't show up against cloud 9.
703888,now we know for sure that ut99/2k4 and quake players were all shameless noobs
703891,i love all the videos that are made when i do the missions in sunset.

704036,"yeah, make it some crazy price like 1000 gold!"
704041,"no, im sure u are the only one, among 7million people on earth, that enjoyed that game mode"
704050,i'm enjoying the daily updates about the mac client being bad.
704059,"call of duty, the game noobs go back to when they realize wow requires too much thinking."
704080,no op you were the only one in all of history and the internet to ever play this game.
704108,"list price is $177, at $54 that's a steal!"
704176,i see team helped you get to dmg
704196,allows him to carry his noob team mate gg he deserve challenger
704568,i guess up to a 7 level lead on them has nothing to do with it.
704579,"zion had a 100% winrate on sion last split, therefore if he plays sion they'll be fine."
704609,"6k comment karma poster willing to boost for trident layers, 1 pack = 500 karma."

706598,"1024x768 if you want to play black bars and 1280x960 if you want to play streched, using one of these resolutions will make you pro and/or will get you to global."
706831,"uhm yah, that's why the ti4 finals were amazing..."
706839,unless you play protoss amirite guys ayy lmao
706909,that's the only reason why i'm not a global.
706920,"no ones gonna get banned, no one drophacks, it's just ghost games"
706961,"yeah, that thing that is funding most of the major tournaments, and helping popularise csgo it's really pointless"
707021,what are you some kind of peasant pleb scrub
707165,how dare people charge for the work they did!

708040,what a noob did not dodge the corki aa

708314,"email them back, maybe we'll get replays!"
708315,you just need more gold mvp stars.
708446,put a spoiler tag on that dude.
708515,i guess i wouldn't know what that feels like
708542,but when flusha does it he's cheating.
708631,it's not like we would *want* to see an awesome command block creation destroy half the map with tnt.
708701,this game was made from recycled assets and started out as a console game and that is why it is a modern benchmark for quality.
708802,"but the buzzing makes me want to smoke crack, heroin, and meth simultaneously, shoot up a bus station, saw off my left testicle, personally stalk and murder every member of iem's production crew, eat their organs, and then kill myself!"
708823,"it's spell fumble, they added it like the chance to trip in smash brothers."
708928,"damn right, her trap what the most op part of her kit, glad it is gone, she is shit tier now"
708932,if it doesn't run well and it's lagging just say it's an euw inspired port

709284,he still plays with 1 impact regardless of what champion hes playing.
709310,no if im unhappy with your product its because i was gypped by the corporations who just want to suck the money out of me and its all a scam 343 is just milking the halo name and is ruining everything in the process and they need to refund everyone their purchases and make the game free and then on top of that i probably still wont be happy so i need some sort of reimbursement for the emotional distress forced upon me by microsoft
709351,"well that doesn't help in a 1v1, no wonder they didn't listen."
709353,can i hop aboard the carry train?
709363,incarnati0n gets unbanned and the servers are down within hours...

710068,too bad there aren't things called lane-swaps.
710070,"yes, riot is actually tracking your account and making sure that your promos are as miserable as possible."

710231,because having fun is a horrible thing that should be regulated
710266,ikr so many retarded junglers in my games smiting the scuttle crab
710280,it was obviously a tactical smoke so that the terrorists couldn't find the bomb.
710384,"right, because that invalidates his point completely."
710459,"d is obviously for dlash man, where have you been all this time?"
710493,he obviously baited the hook to win the trade
710551,as far as i am concerned my drunk dad apperently is the worlds best football coach and he got there by watching from his sofa
710575,played against your tryhard-ass 5man with some nova friends.. &lt;.&lt; they said it was a fun learning experience!
710645,me because he played so well in summer split
710653,"i'm guessing it's the source of particle spawn in the game currently, so it had to be nerfed."
710717,motar2k donations clearly wasn't enough for shroud or should i say $hroud.
710738,crazy ex-girlfriend's are never vindictive

710812,time to go to /fit/ :'c guess i gotta give up on being a phantom weight mma fighter
710840,you can tell because of all the additions to the hobbit story for the movies that are pointless except for lotr continuity.
710951,but how are we supposed to support the developer if they don't want to take our money?
710960,don't be a transphobic shitlord!
710964,or just script like everyone since riot doesn't give a fuck and doesn't have an anticheat
711036,yes because an abundance of content equals a good game or good value.
711037,you did a great job backing up your claim.
711046,"riot, thank you for developing your game and giving people a reason to buy skins that looked outdated"
711053,"if your age is on the clock, get ready for me cock !"
711086,yeah because that's their thought process ofc
711088,"let's just make climbing easier in every way possible, right?"
711109,"i can honestly say that is the first time i've made a brain fart typing mistake in ages, oh well at least i made it on the subreddit of a community i respect!"
711144,"yeah clearly riot wants to ruin the game that they have built from a tiny game made by a small studio into the world's biggest game, and clearly you know more about game design than their entire team with a several million dollar budget and years of experience."
711154,yeah i feel like we really get to know our followers by looking at a percentage and pressing send on mission
711170,ye the crash of economies reliant on oil is much to celebrate..
711175,this will also solve the pfe problem
711183,"that's not possible, one of the two coding teams must have just finished working on dj sona."
711188,oh well that makes it totally ok
711198,"if he could get a dash for every few seconds, stacks up to 3, he could see some play."
711239,"uol, now with up to 100% more in game peripheral failure."
711245,"you use kinect, so obviously you're living wrong."
711254,they introduced tier sets to normal highmaul?
711258,"good you posted here, i'm sure some rioter will see this and move you to plat in no time."
711262,because there is pretty much not a single male champion or skin focused on muscles/abs...
711274,is that because he tanks in every match?
711286,"a paid mount, exactly what i was hoping for!"
711292,they better remove lucian before we all are black
711297,i love how you are focusing on the choice of os instead of what the video reveals.

711345,guys it's just that 16 tick demo
711364,"pretty good, but it would be better if you could get more than half-damage to magicka."
711419,"pshhh, i can do that in my sleep"
711453,"nah dude, if your top laner gets ganked 50 times while your jungler is busy farming its your top laners fault for not putting down 3 wards constantly and conceding every bit of cs to the enemy laner"
711456,lol people are downvoting me cause they don't get
711492,i can only agree with the wonderful arguments you presented to support your point.
711586,bush control is crucial in winning the lane
711609,here's an idea: a skyrim prequel with a premade character like in redguard that shows how the main character was caught at the border by the imperial ambush!
711613,"yeah, no one buys cards considering anything other than price/performance ratio and if they do, they must be ignorant."
711621,nice totally not biased version of the story that totally didn't twist the truth at all
711626,"i, for one, am looking forward to 8000 selfie posts in this thread!"
711635,bard... jesus how many times do we have to say it?
711670,"hey, you get a health shrine every 2 minutes as he comes to collect your lane's meeps, that's almost as good as a support, right?"

711844,yes sona totally needs an ultimate having arcade and 6 other skins isn't enough
711922,goliath and kraken would be to big
711935,these so called next gen systems
711948,it's your own fault for wearing such a provocative dress.
712009,same thing happened to my stattrak karambit fade factory new... valve pls
712050,how i long for the days of the gp/oldraka lane with a mana manipulator rush.
712064,"fuck people with bad eyes, lern 2 watch normally"
712073,the real disturbing thing is you being a sona main.
712082,"ah, yes, i was wondering why my panties fell when i opened this thread."
712104,"guys, listen to this guy, his uncle works for valve so he knows all their inner workings and greedy ways."
712105,"after all, pc gamers *never* get sales."
712131,"yea you're right, japan loves outsiders"
712136,finally giving toxic summoners a reason to change their attitude.
712144,oh wow thanks i didnt know that until now
712153,"watching his stream and some of his frags, maybe he gets an overwatch ban for aimbot."
712190,"if only he would have done it, maybe he would have been caught by now"
712213,fuck game mechanics i should be able to stand in graphics and you should be able to heal me through it!
712234,because this doesn't happen in every other sport
712258,"a colorful wrist pad, i'm impressed."
712279,yep just why they will release star citizen first in consoles
712318,that's surely the reason ezreals q is so op
712367,wouldn't it be great if they had a massive beta where 343i could test everything out?
712375,u nevr need to ward becuz your team is supposed to ward unless their feedrs.
712387,i'm sure that one single report got you 75 games of chat restriction
712392,"lol, no argument in response, better tell him he's a troll that'll show him."
712410,"it's a save battery it poweres the sram, to save games"
712414,i think he should be on the analyst desk.
712426,for scientific reasons obviously.
712441,"hey guys, check out this hardcore summ1t fan."
712444,"shit, why didn't i think of that?"
712445,because all females play support in this game
712450,but just the fact that spawn camping can even happen is purely the developers fault!
712492,since faker is chinese for sure
712528,this has never been suggested before.
712532,because we are all millionaires from selling our coal and kangaroo meat
712557,"totally, because all of these are definitely only in new hampshire."
712565,pre-order from a company that ships broken products then breaks them even further after release!
712582,"cause, if you know... if you rewarded the player with anything in the game, it would mean you literally did it in real life and should be arrested."
712620,"for better perfomace you might want to get a pc with one strong core, not eight that try to share the burdon but cant because of the engine (or maybe a dualcore and run your system on the other core)."
712648,yeah screw teenagers for thinking about the future!
712655,"... no, i am fucking too dumb to do that."
712701,well get a new fucking keyboard.
712720,yeah you fucking feeder ass feeder
712762,sounds like a wonderful server.
712778,"16 tick demo, not proof...even pro players do stuff like this in 16 tick"
712797,no man kata threw because she was mean to him
712922,"conspiracy theory: it was ~~the illuminati~~ ipkane that made the megathread, to curb all the hate."
713356,yes because doing nothing was not an option.
713397,"yeah, silly me for being upset at blizzard from removing one of my favorite features."
713497,"well, atleast his group doesn't have a fee"
713619,"nah, if you read closely, you can clearly see you both have the same opinion"
713699,sure.. upload it yourself before someone else busts you
713737,some really great anthony burch level writing there
713812,guess we know why rush went to na now
713846,"because we're not like traditional sports, we're esports!"
713891,"yeah right, nerf range junglers juggling even more, because they were so popular at the moment"
713900,"trading off jinx's early game damage for late game was a smart choice, she doesn't do nearly enough damage late game"
713953,i'm sure we all care here right?
714071,runaan's is so much better on aatrox than bork though!
714110,and they're doing a great job fighting ps+
714133,but the seraph powerspike is too good
714280,yes he is an idiot because he can't speak english very well.
714378,the odst mega thread 10 posts down says no one but you got a odst code.
714419,but everything sounded so plausible.
714555,it's more rule34 inkling learn to google scrublord!
714653,careful guys you will get a vac according to everyone who has ever been vac'd before!
714788,"yea, we use p90s instead, rifles are too hard."
714789,wait taric is still in this game?
714952,"a fully 3d underwater game is nice yes , but how about a 100% underwater based mmo?"
714972,"mm, love me a woman who can take a beating."
714987,"my current rank is global elite, and i've yet to witness someone who can consistently play well with that weapon... but yeah, dmgs constantly shoot me in the face with a deagle and still manage to stay at such a shitty rank"
715022,"which part did you mean to be satisfying, autoing blue over the wall or that diana actually waited for the 5 man knock up?"
715147,you should definitely be rude about it then.
715150,this is totally silver 1 footage
715192,but you're not good because le = goldnova 4
715236,you have like tp for global presence
715340,a cod gun skin is 1.99 while a key to get a random gun you may not want is 2.50 the good skins are way more than that but it's different tho because one is valve and one is call of duty so obviously one is better
715361,"i'd be challenger if it wasn't for my slow fingers and terrible map awareness, and several other things!"
715429,it's to hard to press buttons and look at the screen for abilities obviously all abilites should flash red and blue and move at 500 missile speed for clarity.
715504,"so it's very, very important and we all must know for the sake of pantheon jokes."
715655,"it's like if they changed the ip and kept the gameplay, it'd be exactly the same game!"
715725,i reckon we should give the terrorists 5 bombs because just one bomb forces teamwork
715740,that's the new troll haha he got u good bro
715772,first half was smelly ass though
715798,i'd expect them to show up in the nintendo conference
715824,"the guy who killed you was s1mple, everybody knows he is a cheater"
715880,"yeah, microsoft would never talk about tv at a press conference!"
715917,oh please don't i am really sorry
715948,because you should obviously cut out nice real life friends because they are douches online
715985,are you suggesting that don mattrick fucked up or something?
716017,"i don't get it, it's just a picture of zelda."
716034,next patch riot should buff wards to give 200ad and ap so that more people will buy it!
716055,why can't those greedy bastards give us 20 free maps?
716059,twenty passives and another fifteen passives in every basic ability plus seventy-eight passives in the ult that scale with its level isn't mechanical overload!
716088,that early level q is hard to time when last hitting...
716176,instead of making friend notifications for ps4 they make this...
716192,"and a lot of their government assistance payments, too, thanks to walmart's *generous* wages."
716239,"well ummm it has link and zelda, so it must be the same!"
716240,well moe is one of the best awpers in the history of cs iirc...
716246,if you are going to include a console you better include a toaster
716272,it's because they all get vaccinated
716276,maybe i can prove that i have lcs level play and my silver team mates hold me from challenger
716330,"but no, you're stupid for liking a game that i didn't like."
716391,those are all glitches i hear...
716413,cheating on devilwalk's account so he gets a vac ban and everyone thinks it devilwalk who cheated...
716507,"ikr, the fact that in game he has black hair while in splash he has whtie hair is only noticeable if you are playing ultra zoomed in!"
716644,welp time to take him out of the game too.
716649,coz it takes a lot of time to change back the value and patch it
716655,wow are u frankie fucking scripter
716656,"yep, how fucking useless, i'd rather not even use runes!"
716710,"im done with your gender binary garbage, i'll have you know i am 360dayolddrywall-kin and i fund this offensive"
716740,wait i thought we were only supposed to downvote if somebody's post was not relevant to the discussion?
716823,"ah yes, playing death match will make me so good that i can beat supremes while i am a nova 2 with little game sense"
716835,"there's definitely no cheaters in league, scripters totally don't exist in abundance"
716838,"exactly, they should just nerf her ult range to 450, revert the e nerf and be done with it"
716869,rito pls remove bird man's r mana cost
716910,"nah mabn, this game is so pay to win."
717016,"picture is fake, girls don't video game."
717037,omg red side higher percentage than blue side rito plz fix
717078,let's make it deal true damage then
717112,why would you report someone for what's clearly the junglers fault?
717123,"good counter points, love your argument."
717145,"yeah, i don't know about everyone else, but i'm used to getting four man spraydowns with a p250 on four ct's outside on nuke."
717148,"but amumu has a huge aoe stun that does the damage when he builds full ap, now that udyr guy..."
717159,yeah let's have a complete 0% tolerance policy towards anything that could possibly offend someone.
717210,the amount of data you're sending is massive :p
717215,the real reason dominate has been trying to throw.
717223,"yeah, shame that dreamhack stockholm has access to producers that fnatic can't hire."
717469,"but it has that evil fake, implied rape scene..."
717471,"yes, because the servers are totally 64 tick"
717474,"just couldn't spring for that extra dollar, huh?"
717488,probably a good idea to glorify this troll with an article
717518,you mean despite their better usage of the tec-9!
717525,"based off the weapons they are using, their movement, crosshair placement, and communication they are either silvers or bots"
717574,yeah because the steam browser is very good!
717585,if it can't be sure to bitch about how badly optimized the game is.
717602,"yeah man, all the shitty parents care about thiers kids, i mean, its like i want him to have a future and be successful"
717654,"woah, sounds like a shitty controller"
717707,probably some pressure from their sponsor
717757,but get_right does it all the time so it must be good...
717764,"it's cool, they reduced the damage on her e by 30, she can't do that anymore."
717803,just wait until xbone gets directx12 its going to be a game changer !
717883,why can't we ever have classical music or even jazz in these montages?
717996,yeah that talking to each other honestly is too hard though... so much easier to expect each other to just read minds...
718039,are you telling me riot is a business and not a group of friends just trying to make me happy?
718068,"oh, didn't you hear, halo 4 only sold about 10 million copies, it's obviously dead."
718085,"really, are you *sure* that you can't tell?"
718133,"yeah, cheetah puts an entire raid in danger."
718155,its witch hunting so was obviously removed
718227,"as much of a ripoff to dark souls as the last of us is to uncharted, sadly."
718248,cmon bro.. that 1v2 by summit vs 7rws esea players is much better...
718270,call of duty:black ops call of duty:modern warfare 3 call of duty:black ops 2 call of duty:ghosts call of duty:advanced warfare take a guess guys!
718306,he sounds like a professional caster no time for sense of humour
718340,"shut up, stop triggering me you patriarch, sexist, cis-gendered, white heterosexual male, i'm offended"
718348,dat orianna is a fantastic player
718350,how surprising that a competitive game gets people riled up.
718415,then how come flusha's mousepad is so small he hits the side of his keyboard but he is pro player?
718470,"but look on the bright side, you have new minion models!"
718483,cassiopeia is fun and enjoyable to play against.
718495,*cough* *cough* ez skins excel fangayz rabblerabblerabble
718554,"them be wallhacks matey, arrrghh!"
718596,isn't this only tangentially related to league of legends?
718612,is this game supposed to be any good?
718616,i have not actually heard this joke fifty times before.
718622,true photorealism has finally been achieved.
718634,"wait a minute, which picture is minecraft and which picture is real life?"
718657,"wow, it's like the m4 was created by csgo!"
718688,how long before gabe is forgiven then?
718721,when is league coming out with a tor client
718726,never knew why people buy skins they don't use.
718751,i wonder if he'll be back with elements next split
718754,"wait, reddit costs money to comment?"
718790,buys keyboard specially built for scripting in league = profit?
718839,but that was years ago how dare you bring that up you toxic he was still a teenager.
718919,because febiven really seemed like he was playing at his level and wasnt tilting at all
718934,no i don't want xbox one's library to get any bigger
718948,"pft, when was the last time you checked, dismay and hjc have taken over now."
718961,yeah because phantasy has a huge cheating background from cod4
718962,why is there a turd in the wii?
719089,"he isn't cheating, it was a 16 tick demo"
719126,there really is a bot for everything
719182,no but ranged have to kite so they are at disadvantage
719224,"always scapegoat the jew, history repeats itself"
719230,not only the girlfriend she's an ex girlfriend definitely a reliable source!
719235,"yeah, because that's what i meant"
719240,because the charm travels so fast its really hard to dodge!
719264,"but dude, they are giving you a $1,000,000 in-game money to start off with."
719279,"hey man, can't you see we are circle jerking here?"
719305,"cmon, these are obviously the questions that require attention"
719363,"pshhh, implying this is a team game... this is for supports and junglers mains, i only need others to do what i tell them to do in order to feed me so i can carry the scrubs in my team."
719372,"no dude thats way too hard, we suck so much in human interaction that we totally need that offline mode feature!"
719374,jumping is a deal breaker for me
719434,"blurred particles, this is a great sign of things to come."
719466,the american accent of the witcher and the scottish accent of the other dude totally don't break immersion.
719471,i don't look at my champ when i play cause i keep my eyes on the prize
719473,but god knows we all need another mario game
719475,"to be fair, many cheat for skins, smithzz cheated for pussy, which is a far nobler reason."
719496,"yeah man it's just a prank, just a prank alright jeez don't get all upset right"
719498,zed has lower base attack speed that should help.
719505,who are all in a very good spot and highly contested picks.
719523,because there's only one world.
719542,"but this is the csgo subreddit, it wouldn't be the same if people took your words as they are!"
719553,so... you'll be just as useless
719556,"my favourite maps are vertigo, militia and italy."
719562,i actually script on ryze in order not to fail my skills
719598,are you telling me that a blink + movespeed talent is broken on a class with that already has a way to escape from snares
719602,yeah because steelseries makes amazing soundquality headsets right?
719603,"fucking hacker, spawn of flusha."
719604,let's blame some ddos attacks on the employees and fire them all and hire new people because ddos attacks will mever happen with them!
719633,cause mm is the only reason to play right?
719662,"yes, mastering the bizon will improve your gameplay a lot!"
719731,nothing has changed in a year and there is still no wiki to check any updates.
719748,qatar not the correct proportion 0/10 wouldn't view again
719792,yeah because people not using a flair on reddit is going to prevent people from joining mym
719793,wow that meme hasn't already been beaten to death
719822,yeah that was such a severe nerf
719848,i thought all you top laners just solo pushed to inner turret with 0 vision in the enemy jungle and no one on your team in a position to apply pressure and then just type omg 5 top idiots into chat
719942,"yeah it's not like tsm fans shouted usa when playing against lmq or go on a tirade anytime someone criticises them, right?"
719943,"unchecked privilege is my trigger, you alliance scum."
719945,so let's remove all the game modes and put them as options in customs.
719976,doesn't hurt to keep a world champion as a sub
719996,maybe benching wickd will solve the botlane issues.
720010,doesn't the *r* in *aram* stand for *reroll* though ?
720028,"nah, supports have to be tanky initiators,otherwise you're wasting your time"
720032,yes and n0thing accidentally appeared in a denial game
720037,wow piglet is so toxic to the team liquid environment bench forever pls \
720164,"well of course it is your fault, rivens are supposed to 1v5 the enemy team and when she doesn't, it has to be someone on her team that makes her tilt"
720171,because the current jungle meta is super fun to get dunked on by at levels 3-18
720194,dude come on lee vi j4 and reksai every game is diverse enough
720195,"because they did significantly better even they swapped once, they'll do even better if they swap again right?"
720245,"it was such a good gametype, wish riot would do more of these!"
720247,and that's the only thing that needs fixing
720352,because deleting all of them will make people do it less
720394,yes because it is just that simple for some people
720422,we all know what happens when a tsm support is stuck at home...
720429,yea but lissandra's passive total negates here awful mana costs and low mana sustain!
720439,"crucify this man, he said cod is fun."
720447,would anyone like it if riot gave every skin for free?
720449,because this game is truly the first masterpiece to challenge dark souls as a hardcore video game.
720464,yeah because him saying you can get to d5 with mechanics alone means that there's no other way to get there unless you're a god mechanically
720469,"yeah, because when i play *mario kart* i have this empty feeling that can only be satisfied by an epic storyline and a climactic conclusion."
720470,"faker is hacking obviously, since he seems to deal 2x my zeds damage"
720482,my main is teemo; teemo is not actually the devil.
720493,"yeah, who knew a game that was shown super early in its development will look better when it's finished"
720519,"well, where i live, the average gold nova ii happens to be the same as an eu global."
720532,because everyone knows that money is evil
720534,"wow, i totally expected rammus' outplay."
720574,yeah poland isn't eastern european at all
720607,aren't they the same champion but one of them needing to aim a skill to gapclose forever
720636,"yeah whenever it is a bad thing it shows riots true nature, whenever its a postitive thing it's just pr to make them look good."
720637,"counting is hard bro, why do you think rito gave us buff/drake/nashor timers ?"
720642,but 30fps is so much more immersive!
720670,yes you totally don't see bad manners in any other sports event
720673,"trade it to me and i'll trade it back, should fix the problem."
720686,no you cant find from get_right or anyone in nip but all other team cheats
720689,so if we're going off of one day of problems we should agree that riot shouldn't host the lcs at all right?
720713,or fnatic are playing without hacks this lan so they might lose!
720739,"each area of runeterra is a fraction of the land, duh"
720787,"oh, so that explains why jw is called a pig!"
720788,it has call of duty in the name
720807,"no, you feel outraged and entitled for more content for being an early adopter of worms."
720844,"no man, it's not like any recent aaa games have failed in any way recently, *especially with ubisoft*"
720870,"this is a pretty good example of reddit knows best...he's a professional coach, i'm sure you can help him improve."
720919,oh you would say that you catfish.
720926,"because that happened with battlefield, right?"
720997,"you seem to know a lot, maybe you are challenger or something."
721003,"yeah, because lets add another insane awper who isnt that got while we allready have 5 riflers where two are superb with the awp and the rest are top 10 players"
721022,"yeah, man i hope i don't get trolled into playing a champion, that would be awful!"
721029,"wow i'm so excited for the sona skin, i can't wait"
721048,i get annoyed too when people i've never met get excited to play a video game.
721067,won't anyone think of the children!
721068,yeah perfect dark zero and halo 4 look basically the same
721072,"i heard he was the brother that played on emilios, sf's, kqlys and smns accounts."
721147,new video genre: ninja plant/clutch
721172,"come on guys, we need to stop over-sexualising characters in this game."
721173,do you honestly just sit around and bitch about people who bitch about league of legends all day?
721183,"as a riven main, i hate how you guys are always blaming us cause you suck, ffs gg top op, rito nerf garen, /ff at 20 i'm afk..."
721278,how about they do the same thing as smash bros and name it f-zero for nintendo nx
721326,i think you might be using nerf/nurf in the improperly here.
721338,it's almost as if we are different people with different opinions...
721445,"ugh, i don't feel like a god within 10 seconds of playing this game, the combat must suck!"
721859,don't forget the necessarily loud dubstep for background music!
721866,"i'm a gold nova, therefore i am nothing like the people shown in the video"
722104,i truly believe the cz is a balanced and healthy weapon in cs go.
722429,oh yea... going afk while against a cheater... good logic 100% my fault...
722582,"remember guys, no humour allowed, it's obviously incredibly unprofessional."
722633,yeah metal gear solid is garbage.
722659,"unlucky, i got fn dual berettas | briar"
722762,first time i've heard about this
722984,so with an ak you just aim at his foot and you will hit his legs and his head!
723093,"definitely not a cheated account, 100% legit"
723183,chroma skin caused lee sin to miss the smite!
723296,yeah because not putting them on the lounge will fix all ddos problems
723308,it would be nice if you could avoid taking full damage by pressing some button just before hitting ground.
723399,ermahgerd the cis team is made up of all privileged white males call 911
723425,"no, i dont think it's been posted here before."
723434,"come on man, turning the phone sideways to match the screen's orientation is *so* hard!"
723839,if they are lower than me they are noobs if they are higher they are nolife cheaters.
723868,yeah i can't support a company that would do that to its customers
723869,but my level 1 ignite didn't kill my 200 health opponent and its totally the turret's fault :(((
724012,"well it was fun while it lasted, we'll never see an ekko pick again"
724243,"more people is more reports is more overwatch cases, might be a plan from valve to catch cheaters"
724251,i wonder if the owners ever do psychedelic drugs?
724321,he actually spinned the other way around but it was too fast for 32tick so the demo took the short way and made it slower
724515,"ah, surely you missed the part about starfox: zero!"
724540,"yep, i'm sure people will stop playing the game because of a bad client"
724544,"almost, the 0.5% of league playerbase which is on reddit will help them do that."
724547,all the confusion could've been avoided if gtr remembered to close out with
724557,you obviously know very little about your lore.
724576,"stomping new players and other smurfs for 200 games just so you can get a 2nd acc is totally worth the time, dude."
724598,"i dunno, a reskinned bejeweled is much more original."
724612,yeah because your average mm cheating shitty has the same problems as top pro cs players
724663,yeah well you shouldn't have picked the worse system then
724666,im sure clg gives a fuck about fantasy
724683,bang isn't even the best adc on skt
724693,yeah the ps3 digital store is terrible!
724695,but how dare people play this game who haven't invested 1000 of hours since 1.6!
724734,woah literally better than that whole dota 2 patch
724763,they already have that dlc; it's called hardline.
724911,*lalalalalalala not listening- men and women are the exact same lalaalalalalalaa*
724930,ah yes the teens well known for being the cancer of all communities
724994,"that's why football (soccer) is so unpopular, right?"
725028,"yes, because breast exist solely for sex and literally nothing more"
725060,finally we get some m4a1-s suggestions :)
725071,"yes, and you should feel bad for smurfing at that rank!"
725117,there's that monthly post we all know and love!
725156,i knew he hides cheats under the hat.
725184,i guess that would explain why bayonetta has sold soo many copies.
725208,"i think they should introduce abh to csgo, it would completely balance the game and would make it more exciting"
725229,"yeah, but what does testing pens have anything to do with technology?"
725264,i think what he meant was that would be terrain you could walk on if we let you go over there.

725376,"yeah, hold off because the next xbox will be released next month"
725464,"shut up you silver scum, learn to play the game before speaking again."

725979,"they are chinese now, just like how tsm is european"

726071,"wow, you sure know a lot about everybody."
726142,"maybe it will be like clg eu with shaker : one day kevin,dexter,frog, tabzz,nyph; next day wickd, shook, frogg, rekk, krepo"
726147,cause dota struggles with all of that so much
726191,"it doesn't take a scientist to realize that coincidentally actually means it's because wookie was reading the reddit thread, duh."

726493,so much scripting in this video i can't even believe why riot hasn't banned him yet...

726757,guns of liberty is where the series really fell off.
726762,i dont understand me no engrish
726786,"ah yes, coding new skins into the game really just takes less than an hour"
726871,why upgrade your pc from 2006 when you can just play at 240p?
726925,"yeah, let's remove the dust2 mid doors wallbang too"
726948,cuz history shows thats what tsm does to c9 in bo5 series.
726962,human eye can't see above 144p 2fps because we have 2 eyes.
726971,"yeah okay, so i guess chumley will right me up?"

727580,"hey, maybe one day those guys dendy and matt will be just as good as the na players right?"
727610,yes cause valve would totally start tracing ip addresses for users who request...
727651,"hey, it's self-promotion saturday"
727729,"yeah, because anyone with unorthodox political beliefs is just an edgy teenager."
727738,"well, it can only see 24 fps, so that's a pretty shitty upgrade."
727752,what i thought everyone here was challenger
727777,wow we really needed more nidalee and annie skins

728026,"- teammates fault - enemy probably hacking - my teammate didn't sneak - smurf in enemy team wow, i guess i never make mistakes"
728058,that's the only possible explanation though
728096,"still not vac banned, and therefore they are all innocent"
728109,"duh, why do you think he wants to return it."
728142,"they have to skip the ads, 30 seconds not watching pewds is 30 seconds wasted after all!"

728238,"it's a cod org, so it must be horrible."
728251,apsect of the fail is the best thing to happen to pugging!
728272,unless they prefer to still call xbox one/ps4 next-gen and it will be 360/ps3 only.
728287,especially mexico those taco loving racist bastards
728299,don't know what i'm saying sounds like you're really trying to take responsibility for your actions and make a positive change ...
728338,"plot twist: he's actually using noclip, and is really good at faking it."
728363,i wonder why people say this game is toxic.
728405,"the xbox one has been out for over a year, crazy that you're the first person to notice this!"
728475,sure looks like tsm/c9/liquid/clg are living in some infinitely terrible living conditions.
728530,sounds like that would cost us a raid tier
728545,wooow i've never seen this before...
728560,"yeah fuck tsm for having fans, those poor professional players who get tilted by a tsm chant"
728565,"holy cow, this has never been posted here before, isn't on the lol wiki, and is completely new awesome information."

728810,so you're saying... there's a chance?
728852,then why bother posting or taking about it?
728861,because they're the only team that hasn't won anything in three years of course (just forget every other na team besides c9 and tsm)
728898,"yeah she has really good damage i'm just bad, that's why so many people are playing her.."
728917,i bow down to you sophisticated european overlord.

729498,"agreed, i lost 23 ranked matches because of this unimplemented feature, rito do something."
729509,the reason there are more nip frags bits is because ldlc operated as a team with each one getting a single kill each round.

729873,"yeah you're not allowed to enjoy things the rest of reddit doesn't like, come one son"
729875,"fer is a god himself, no need to pray"
729963,from his years of programming experience for multiplayer online games and inner knowledge of the workings of riot
730292,but its not an aaa title if its not as deep as sotc or ni no kuni
730300,"yea, i think that totally wasnt meant as a joke"
730588,"oh but tsm lost, that means bjerg is terrible"

731263,"as long as the public sees these pictures, it doesn't matter where these guys end up in 5 years."
731284,"you don't get it man, it's just a video game."
731295,i also like that he talks over the other casters and talks way too long at times.
731713,cause every game has to be 100.
731786,filthy casuals play other fps games.
731931,don't forget almost every le+ eu player.
732069,i just played fallout 4 and it was the same as in the trailer while the witcher 3 was clearly downgraded.
732101,not at all :-( i knew i should've put
732108,"yeah, there's *nothing* spectacular about that..."
732220,so he can restore a small portion of his health and get a small movementspeed bonus
732322,that is way too much clarity for us to handle!
732388,entering the overwatch list clearly
732674,"yeah, because cod has never had celebrities before."
732740,world in conflict is loads of fun for the casual crowd.
732809,it's almost like similar cases from different games can't be an healthy addition to the discussion or something
732844,even more ridiculous than olofpass?
732862,"finally, an original idea appears on this subreddit"
733037,"i liked monkey island and day of the tentacle, but it seemed like they were just repeating themselves with same &amp; max."
733049,"*gasp* oh my, he probably says 'ggez' hope this guy gets permabanned from lcs"
733050,our glorious leader ellen pao is keeping us so safe.
733058,yeah because collectors edition items always sell on ebay for cheaper than you bought them for.
733073,and the port will be awesome like the ff13 games
733111,"it isn't confusing if you bothered to play all of the handheld expansions, jeez!"
733120,dude you havent heard about the huge wearhouse sony bought to run hundred of thousands of ps3 all at one time?
733142,"ah, so that is why they hired ghostcrawler."
733209,"with the new champion coming out who needs new client, replay system, etc."
733247,"riiight, the oldest excuse in the book."
733348,"i heard a random guy at the street shout that hitler is still under us, must be true then."
733352,"focus on being the most sought after position on any team, the useless lurker instead of doing any good lurking like tying down cts on the bombsite across the map from your team or baiting rotates, then getting behind them when your team actually attacks the other bombsite, instead wait for your team to take another site while you hide in a corner and treat every round like you're saving as soon as the timer starts you'll probably get one or two kills at the end of every round after the rest of your team dies and the other team is hunting for you, and you can complain about leading your team in kills while losing 16-0"
733367,and then the games that mattered came and he played like a real god right
733382,"qkly wanted to make a comeback one day, or so i've heard"
733396,obviously faker is testing the waters for a low income possible mid lane alistar.
733409,please take this down as it might have an unfair competitive advantage over others.
733437,aging - it has been 9 years since the first game!
733443,some users are reporting performance issues its just some people so keep calm
733444,russians will get this shitty f2p version while rest of the world will get halo mcc :)
733453,hey did you guys here about e3?
733484,"calm down, that paintball gun isn't coming out for another 2 years!"
733511,"sure, pirate a game because you want to play it but don't want to pay money for it."
733570,who needs azure servers if you can have full 1080p?
733574,you must be a fun teammate to have.
733625,*sigh* i definitely haven't seen this like 100 times already
733652,"agreed, but bounty paper towels are clearly superior to scott, and you're a douchebag if you don't think so."
733663,yes because if there's one thing the zelda series needs right now it's another remake.
733718,i didn't realize bethesda sold things on ebay and titled them with 'extremely rare.'
733741,"well, they need something to toggle on when the enemy is *obviously* hacking, right?"
733752,nautilus nerfs but no changes to alistar
733754,"i don't feel comfortable, hitman only encourages the victimizing and killing of women"
733774,surely nintendo's next home console will be cheaper than a 3ds!
733893,yea i love playing third party games on my wii u
733902,"and yet the dragon is too easy to take at that point, it should fire laser beams and have teemo shrooms on it's entrance"
733904,because clearly old veigar was a great high-skillcap champion with tons of counterplay and no toxic kit whatsoever and because dabox said veigar is bad means that riot literally pulled a jagex on him
733915,physics for game programmers: physics optimization strategies definitely sounds like a time to announce hl3.
733925,they're too busy fixing the game
733934,"because you won a lot, congratz."
734003,"nah, he just has great situational awareness."
734047,"no, voyboy was toptier midlaner and tsm fans are all reasonable and rational people."
734079,wait until we find out it will only becoming to the dota series
734187,i mean we all have to get our priorities straight... league food/water cleanliness social life in that order^^^
734199,yeah totally forgot about it harassing steel on daily basis on social media
734276,if everyone get acces to the game engine there will be mods i see tottaly no problem with this.
734368,"shouldn't really be on the internet either, but hey, at least now he can find out how many people have had intercourse with his female parent and how skilled they are and how he's trash that should kill himself."
734375,"the guy in your flair has the highest winrate of any *champion,* he is clearly overpowered."
734376,"what, are you saying emo haircuts and sharktooth necklaces are out of style?"
734407,glad i can see the actual kills.
734457,"dude, video games are the most serious thing ever!"
734472,i went to photography school i know more about art than u
734476,lets support a guy who rage hacked **on stream** and posts all about how he's going to fuck his prostitutes on twitter!
734477,let me just do that in the middle of a round!
734533,it happen to me yesterday ... to top it off ... dont ask me why ... but my cfg kinda got wipe/reset ... fuck this game .. i'm uninstalling
734537,because ge and c9 are on an equal level :p

734547,"omg, blasphemy.. he's going to hell for sure now"
734718,"but they did it to diablo, that means it has to work for league and every other point and click game ever made!"
734764,thank you for this from a female with small boobs i agree 100% agree
734796,i got to lem after my first 10 games
734908,"i know when i first started playing dota, it was really bad that every player had every hero unlocked and no runes or masteries to work towards."
735013,"one time i did something similar but a lot more impressive, sorry i don't have any proof or credibility."
735034,according to this subreddit half of the people are dmg's
735110,you have to upgrade every year but with console's you just get an update and boom better graphics
735112,"duh, i thought everyone is in 6th grade like me :p i never have homework xd"
735123,because the moderators are doing exactly what the oregon police are.
735151,"not a bug, you now will run a few extra steps before you can walk, since walking is op."
735276,but monte is salty because he is no longer in clg so we can't rely on anything he says about clg.
735323,"nah, they have a hollow treestump in darnassus, they don't need that."
735326,"til that buying a season pass no longer counts as buying the content, but rather buying a coupon for the items."
735336,time to rebuild him as a bruiser!
735373,because tone inflection is sooo easy to detect over the internet
735405,real game designer talking here.
735438,it just wouldn't make a sense thematicly
735455,nonono don't worry i'll be fine i'm silver 1 they can't hit shots anyway
735472,yeah its really hard for a play by play caster to not be fucking stupid
735522,this game promotes violence towards men and should be banned.
735530,omg not related to league of legends please remove
735547,i love guys that use their knives in the air then backstab you at 30% and are super sorry over coms
735584,he obviously waited for level 6 so he had his ultimate
735604,what if one tells the bot to stay and the other to go?
735622,"that is so forward, it makes me think you're trying to cover something up, now i need to go find my detective hat, and grow a scruff."
735641,"whoa, let's not over exaggerate here."
735647,"dont worry, the mods here will help notifying valve by removing this post in an hour."
735699,because smite is the top laner's job.
735719,you make that statement in a nintendo focussed subreddit...i smell heresy
735745,or maybe youre just not good at overwatch?
735756,"this should be deleted, it is not directly related to league of legends and also witch hunting towards the moderators"
735813,because reddit is 100% right about a game months before it comes out.
735818,14% max health in a 550 range aoe and a 900 base damage ult what are you talking about that is perfectly balanced
735822,gaming companies don't have customer relations.
735844,it's on the internet it should be free.
735954,yea cause of the crowd it wasn't because they were all playing like goddam monsters at all nope
736116,obviously there is no potential for abuse... like how esea totally didn't hijack people's video cards to mine bitcoin.
736122,yeah he was really the shining star of eg
736144,because zed takes so much skill.
736217,but minion block adds strategic diversity and encourages smarter gameplay!

736359,"if only the wii u was based on the same hardware as the gc and wii so that it could run the games natively, and was somehow compatible with gc controllers."
736376,"yah, because throwing potatoes with soccer ball costumes that folows people are not"
736447,"they do have dried sand, it's called glass."
736595,ofc he didnt because he is global elite stuck in elo hell
736627,wavedashing makes you automatically win
736639,but ubisoft was extremely nice and gave us free dlc for no reason!
736652,no one uses a *mac* to play *games*.
736660,"yes *of course*, a single mod's *method* of generating volcanoes ruins all chance of vanilla volcanoes."

736807,dae prefer metal and queen/the beatles
736880,"as a gay black silver 4, what the fuck is reddit?"
736884,i swear i would be challenger by now if it wasn't for the shop freeze.
736886,"because dota=antifun, toxic burden of knowledge."
736906,and we all know that movie games have huge amounts of effort put into them
736967,"huh, contested country... i've never heard of it, where is this place located, and more importantly; how's the food?"
736980,"yeah, combat rogues 100-0ing someone or damn near close to it in a kidney red buff killing spree is the definition of a cc bot."
736987,"yes, clearly my opinion differing from yours is reminiscent of a high school student"
736992,"hopefully with the money from viewers, he can buy some clothes"
737019,"we have a generation of kids who *watch other people play games* like football and basketball, like what the fuck is happening to society?"
737043,"because reddit you know, intelligent, rational, well informed, thinking individuals?"
737049,maybe they're just really confident?
737058,that's why everyone hates tf2 and valve.
737133,"yes, because the people who unsub after defeating lfr are the ones that are willing to put in the time and effort to join a raiding guild."
737148,"ye, add me, get zed fed, i know im bronze but that's just elo hell"
737168,i just think they lift their mices more often.

737516,"and jw is still being an asshole to nip, even though they shook hands and hugged each other when nip won esl one, right?"
737520,"because everyone knows that immigrants destroy culture and not add to it and enrich it, right?"

739486,"only about 200 times, i'm sure op meant to just spread this rarely posted content a bit more."
739540,the only difference between you two.
739792,"because saying gg ez at the end of the game is such an integral part of league of legends that it needs to be said, even if it bothers people."

742267,you can't forget the amazing quests they added in the last stable update
742361,wasnt the last set where fenix was cheater scum and walked around the ledge!
742507,"yeah, it's so impossible to climb in silver!"
742519,"yah people, you heard the man, stop having varying opinions!"
742525,neither do non-nintendo published games.
742569,all gore didn't invent the internet until the 90s...

743029,"no better evidence than that, right?"
743211,you forgot the part that norton will actually increase the performance of your computer.
743286,maybe it was the excessive use of cobblestone that set him off.
743307,"i agree actually, but we don't say that on reddit because dyrus is so consistent, so good at adapting and only ever does poorly if he's camped"
743315,lol yeah lee sin and renekton are toxic
743411,i wish i had to go through a loading screen every 5 mins in real life as well

743984,"one in each hand, what could be more balanced?"
744070,"i'd just wear a plain shirt, i have no rank because i'm spending too much time having sex to play cs:go."
744111,because warlocks need more class quests
744147,well submitting bug reports on the forums is improving the game sooo much.

744511,yeah man your eyes cant tell the difference over 30 fps anyways
744561,"another side scrolling game, super pumped."

744574,"omg people want riot to just do everything don't you know x, y, z has been done and legacy code blablabla they only made $1b last year how do you expect them to do this and fix bugs"

744599,oh my god you said period that means discussion is over and you are right all hail free_exploit_lol
744606,i'm guessing no one cares if pluto blows up or not.

744872,we don't like warowl anymore because steel said so.
744884,"no, btw im doublelift get played :ddd"

744910,"you're right, this is much better than console gaming with friends"
744932,apocalypse jokes have been reserved solely for the augpocalypse sorry
744953,yea because link whoring is so much more useful.
745039,it's almost like there aren't demos of my recent matches.
745049,everyone knows the reason server lags out is because it isn't 128 tick.
745082,"ok, i'm really glad you are letting us know"
745124,"yes but cringe is the new word that cool people use nowadays, get in the flow man, you're so cringeworthy"
745145,"thats right, they should hold the whole event in poland just to piss off thorin"
745171,the news doesn't have to play games to know everything about them and pass their 100% true opinions about them.
745210,because ad's clearly need a buff in aram...
745224,doesn't he know that he mouse needs to be attached to something to work.
745310,"yeah, because the always online factor really made background music possible"
745326,surf_rainbowroad t8 69 stages can be surfed as linear.
745349,freakin politics man... he is better than any pro.

745380,"a meteor, monsters, gaia ideology, huge superweapon being misused, finding a small number of special objects to complete a task, misunderstood antagonist,... yeah, nothing to do with final fantasy at all."
745388,yeah have no idea why they aren't picking fiora
745458,"omg society sucks, better kill myself now"
745470,i really think that if siren stuck it out they would have gone to worlds last year.
745473,it's because they're moving the servers to the east coast!
745491,yeah i think bots should be atleast better than bottom fragger
745521,just like every other open source project
745550,you need to be able to lose everything you own gambling with it.
745613,"that's because the u s of a is the only country and region in the world, god you're a silly head"
745646,but if you buy a pink ward you can counter her 3 no cost/cd damaging and reseting gap closers.
745679,yeah i feel really good for being left out of the fun because i'm new.
745705,you must speak for everyone in the community.

745967,"oh boy, another reason to go to ashran"
746006,why does xerath not get bonus damage on autos after landing a spell wtf rito this champ needs this!
746088,nothing much.. just your daily blind e-q baron steal followed up by a quadra kill... nothing impressive i agree.
746114,"given your wording and my perception of your intelligence, i am sure you were very nice to that girl at best buy."
746143,but it's not a big deal why are you making such a big deal out of it
746148,"hmm i have windows os, im definately using the mac client"
746177,"your name is bigjosh9inch, im guessing youre a big kid with a 9 inch dick"
746206,"i'm so shocked, totally didn't see this happening!"
746215,"god, whenever people say games make me violent i just want to punch them in the face!"
746257,having a top post on reddit with a picture of rematch happening tells you a lot of how useful it is.
746274,because madlife predicting exactly where people would flash in order to land a hook was clearly thresh being op and had nothing to do with the player
746288,"yeah, you're right imp and deft singlehandedly carried their teams to worlds"
746303,git a better computer bet you didn't think about that heueheuheuheue

746470,"obviously cheating, you can see how the crosshair locks on and then he tries to play it off."
746475,maybe your riven could do better if you didn't feed the enemy riven ugh
746483,quit going on a witchhunt bro hes just got really sick game sense!
746497,"it's okay, all yellow people are the same anyway"
746503,"in other news, you shouldn't wear tight or revealing clothes if you don't want to get raped."
746513,"well shamans don't count, they aren't a real class anymore."
746545,because your favourite game is only good is everyone else's favourite game is shit compared to it
746581,honestly i'd change my e-mail and steam passwords if i were you i'll pm you a good password
746608,i only use vim because i can't figure out how to close it
746610,i guess you're not the only one who missed the
746646,"there is chicago but it isn't labeled and looks like its in minnesota, guess labeling detroit was a better idea because its a nicer city."
746657,that was the obvious choice in that situation.
746694,why bother competing and improving your product when you can just lock the games and force people to buy your system?
746701,yep only ibuypower buys cz75 how pathetic
746736,get ready for fnatic to take this down
746745,yeah thats the sole reason she gets buffed
746781,lol @ reddit neckbeards not understanding how to detect sarcasm without a

746806,how do you play games with only half of a controller?
747303,they must really like nami to say her name after an ace!
747664,"yeah, that account of yours totally checks out."
747687,i forgot i play games for a map and a soundtrack
747801,so we get less shit posting silvers and dmgs on this subreddit asking when they'll rank up
747802,"but he's so nice and passionate, clearly he deserves the best na has to offer"
747825,"you're roleplaying a pirate, in a cs:go thread?"
747976,she was quite difficult for new players to pick up
748002,"well of course aoe is better than fifa, what do you mean?"
748004,"yes, it is currently not a goldmine and the majority of players are very upset about ladder hit boxes."
748249,how did you know where the last guy was?
748287,"thank you blizz just what i wanted in the game, everything is now balanced."
748304,so... what's the difference between this and a normal cs match then?
748317,"that original post was very elaborate, we totally knew what you were talking about"
748379,rumour has it that the last of us 2 is 80% complete and sony are looking to quickly leave the console market.
748445,"well, in league whenever someone loses a duel its because they are shit, not because the enemy is good"
748588,"he man, when you have an ssd and your computer boots up in less than 2 seconds 3 seconds to load up a game feels like an eternity"
748624,"nice, new fresh idea that nobody has thought of"
748695,"no, it would take too long to localize the text."
748773,"karthus, only need to use the r button!"
749128,because eu make all the right moves
749156,omg it's legal in denmark stfu!
749207,can't you see people saying stuff is way worse than trolls even though theres a mute button
749224,he can sell that and buy you a better camera.
749225,while releasing another chroma case.
749287,cause things like that dont happen regardless of timeouts or 64 tick
749354,i'd rather have more skins added.
749381,my cs:go skins are much more well thought out and never that ugly.
749390,yeah richard lewis doesn't know anything
749404,i'm sworn to carry your burdens
749476,i thought they fixed wallhacking
749547,"how come tracer scored so low, i thought she was god tier you guys"

750080,"dude, wouldn't you drop an extra $400 for the privilege of paying for more dlcs ?"
750103,"yeah so you'll get 3% faster in lane for warding there, and having stiml those 3% seems so broken"
750148,"steel the infallible told me i have to hate him, therefore i shall."
750149,but you can't calculate time on a calculator
750231,this will never happen you need to pad it with a troll centered raid with the zandalari or something
750234,"ooh, watch out, this man's gonna 'let' you edit your comment, you better be thankful fam"
750273,"lol america is literally the worst country in the world, like 10x worse than ethiopia"

750411,i'm just sick of pcs holding back consoles all the friggin time!
750445,it's so great that you showed us the connectors on those cables so we have atleast some idea where they plug into

750695,"well, by frankie's logic, launders is allowed to take some content from frankie's video if it's for entertainment purposes, because obviously frankie cheats for people's entertainment."
750730,"thanks for your help, i'll definitely look into your insightful advice."
750781,if they used the same system your papers would come back with a different name
750803,"whoa, it's cute how you can't even work with"
750944,if it looks like they'll lose then the rioter will ban enemy players in the middle of the game so they win
751035,"but think about all the poor eurpoeans who make less money than american who aren't the ones buying rp, how will these poor people who aren't buying luxury goods to begin with going to afford that new annie skin"
751036,yeah just like last iem wc where they trounced the 8th place korean team and went on to win the tournament
751038,"yeah you're right, his stun is worse in every respect and his q is a skillshot that means you can shoot it from a safer range"
751039,"yeah, im sure fusion was scared that they were going to lose to a ragtag team of shitters"
751237,why didn't you use your screenshot app?
751316,he doesn't play with n0thing that much
751322,isn't it unfair that basketball players have to play on a court?
751340,"hey, man they almost beat samsung white in that bo5."
751349,nidalee is the most balanced and healthy champion in league of legends
751364,no dude 1.6 was literally the best and cs go is absolute shit
751379,"well, we all know that unless you're on a pc, you're not actually gaming..."
751474,nah man she was turnt as fuck drinking all night smoking all summer
751552,why would xpeke leave a team that is going to be lcs next split for a team that will be challenger next split?
751655,wow never knew season looked like that in 4k
751660,i stand by my statement further then.
751692,yeh but if i flame others they'll play better and then ill get to play in lcs
751703,could be titanfall but its gonna be neverwinter...
751761,no you didn't.you're not fooling anyone kappa
751862,thats why the game lags for some people when they buy items their computers need to rerun the calculations on their stats
751971,uols victory over tsm means nothing right.
751972,"yeah man, even nintenude is saying yusui is toxic."
751987,"man, that hack richard lewis always pushing his agendas and making up shit."
751998,"i know, they should just give everyone every game free... that is how business works right?"
752047,"yeah, because there aren't any screen printers in california who could print an already designed shirt within 30 days."
752135,to make operation missions harder.
752146,yep spot on... krepo 100% retired from league and never stated the article written on him was wrong
752151,thank god riot has it's priorities straight and works on something important for a change.
752210,"because the same employees and teams are clearly responsible for skins as the actual mechanics, client, replay system or infrastructure"
752220,"no, this is the internet, opinions are bad unless they are mine"
752226,"yeah i don't like it either bro, nobody should get to enjoy it"
752272,"yea, but there already has *been* a world championship in the nordic european countries"
752361,but he isn't a brainless champion that gives me freelo qq
752364,cos they can't see shit with their 'god' 800x600 res.
752381,"because if just one of us says that he can do 4k at 60fps on high, rockstar is legally obligated to make it happen for him"
752436,there should be 4 green dots showing if any skill is off cd
752482,na man ps4 is just a media box that's why it's outsold the xb1 every month since release except for one month.
752483,"buffalo wings, chips &amp; dip, and drinks, for a $30 fee per player."
752497,those graphics will definitely be in the final version.
752499,yeah he should totally only play against cheaters all the time!
752563,oh yea... because deficio and that other clown don't ever miss shit...
752638,they've put so much work on character models with all the weapon clipping that happens.
752641,where do i apply for coach i can take my own team flaming me
752674,"bullshit, you should do everything in life for free, so you can live on the streets."
752675,"your cheat provider , we had 3 big ban waves the last days... :| guess you did not see the big"
752704,"it's referencing the players, not the characters."
752784,the eye can't even see over 24fps anyway
752786,we're paying more because it has more p's bro.
752794,remember how garbage elise was at release?
752847,to get obliterated by bjergsen.
752868,they will change roster untill they fix their shotcall and strategy problem
752871,because it was a very hard and big map to learn.
752875,good job on testing it immediatly after you've done the code.
752987,therefore i can only assume renekton is bad.
753003,"he can't be a cheater, he got a skin!"
753009,but fahrenheit is so much better for temperature.
753093,inb4 rito lets you search for lucian by typing in black guy
753096,yeah you definitely need to cover that game case for a demo
753128,maybe you kill gul'dan in the mythic only phase of the grom fight at end of the xpack...
753154,eune all toxic nobdy gets skin gg
753211,yea but i'd rather save that one keypress and type bae instead of babe.
753242,but if we don't preorder our games how can we be sure that they won't run out of digital copies?
753260,but... but we can't see past 24fps.
753264,"sadly, the notorious pob *lost -20* lp holy crap, they still won?"
753305,can we please get a video of faker's dick
753346,easier to shoot a m4a1 than a jumping player
753354,"flush doesn't actually click the mouse button at all, so that's why it doesn't look like that for him..."
753372,sounds like you play too much league of legends
753404,that's why tennis is rising in popularity and everyone loves watching it
753432,"well, if he liked silk road, i bet he'd love agora."
753433,"yeah, he's totally clickbaiting to earn that sweet karma..."
753439,it was deemed too violent so it was removed
753441,but hes not nova so clearly novas are trash compared to him
753470,yeah i'm sure he acts just same as he does on stream when he goes to lans.
753492,"just dodge the knives, problem solved"
753506,they should also stream scrims the rest of the week.
753545,"yeah, if not for that unfortunate bug, dig would have totally won"
753557,because of the same reason kata is op.
753558,"as someone who picked up vi recently i feel i am always left alone, noob team!"
753560,obviously all are suckers when a ret destroys them since as you learned they do no dps
753563,"yes, gotta celebrate being able to finally be able to say you're straight with out being killed."
753619,every game they lost was a throw because you lost skins
753649,yeah let's just make all invisibility spells also grant invulnerability for balance because being invisible isn't good enough!
753653,"no, we are paying 60 bucks for nothing."
753683,that would make a huge difference
753708,because all women have to be busty and naked or look 5 years old.
753743,omg but it is so similar to arcade sona fuck that skin rito
753748,you have to worry because total biscuit said so because qc issues because it's lying to the consumer because it's a bad game - not running on 999 fps on 9k resolution because it's bad and consumers nowadays are all mindless whales who will just spot buy everything
753751,"it's point and click like taric, no?"
753755,"hey dude reddit knows all, you shouldn't question it."
753756,"of course, a team of silvers is just like a team of dmgs."
753758,just enter your world of warcraft account password for access.
753759,easy: buy more rp to get this dlc.
753760,brf link aotc:b ilvl 700 req people not doing 70k dps will be kicked
753762,just make it a quarter between each pixel
753772,"what do you mean man, the game is fine."
753799,"wow, that has to be some of the creepiest history i've seen in a while, the man likes his loli and rule 34, that's for sure... though i wonder how he got that fucked up view of women.."
753838,every hardcore league player's problem.
753864,damn people making mistakes how dare them
753875,"yeah you are right, when you hide between a thin tree and the nade explodes just close to the tree and you take 0 damage, that's the correct response too."
753903,"nice maymay, i tip my fedora to you kind sir!"
753925,"to be fair that could just be referring to the river, 'niger', which he thinks is filthy!"
754027,"bullshit, of course the community knows better."
754029,and you forgot to put: any french team on the least favorite list
754054,team darkness... really these names can't get any better
754065,"it's reddit, everyone that comments is disagreeing with the person they commented on, duh!"
754079,"im d4 and elohell, youre wrong, your public execution takes place in 24 hours"
754094,it's actually meant to be of in this situation.
754107,not to mention its solely your fault!
754123,"pff, i would rather spend $600 on it to make some fragmovies."
754125,screw valve for making something you weren't meant to get to anyway unclippable.
754160,come on that's just the 16-tick demo
754167,"also your crosshair, chair, mouse and keyboard?"
754178,but you'll never use that .5 gb
754234,still waiting for piglet to mouse only doublelift...
754250,this video is fake and cgi khazix is non-meta jungler and ergo cannot win games and is unviable.
754254,ye because being the number 2 is not at all worth it!
754261,gee i wonder why they didnt go on pbe
754267,i work for ms too and if you give me your username and password i can get you a free years worth of xbox live.
754290,they should just remove the particles and different model and make it 750.
754324,butbutbut we just got a female champion... i call for gender equality you feminazi's
754334,"no but if you included information about where i lived and worked i might, but of course we all know that hasn't ever happened"
754337,"if you had the money to buy her a ring, why don't you have the money to buy the games?"
754343,it's to prevent morello from noticing irelia too much.
754391,"uhm if you don't know you cis-shitlord, then you're too privileged!"
754407,how dare a world champ compare himself to na adcs!
754480,"he wants a memory card, should you judge him so?"
754484,"it is an fps with a class system, they are just ripping off tf2!"
754490,yes spending $120 to get something free is a good deal
754505,"oh, i thought even on the internet help was appreciated - my mistake."
754520,"youre just jealous, all you have is dust"
754547,which is very easy with sub200 dmg abilities
754556,"th is r/gaming, downvoted don't follow the rules of the rest of reddit"
754567,doublelift literally worst ad carry na
754598,you should probably stop watching the gif then
754600,you're talking about lucian right?
754638,maybe shes not a ban in high elos but in lower shes pretty much banned every game and if you dont ban her and the enemies get her you get why didnt you ban trist dumbass ahh i love being in silver
754639,in other words this was a super simple play that i do in bronze all the time but my team keeps me back
754661,well i'd rather not see them unless they're js.
754677,it must be so exciting having 30 clips of you playing your winning card and then alpha striking.
754679,what about us early adopters though?
754681,"but akali only stomps low elo, in high elo, people know to buy pink wards and make her useless lmao"
754698,"scream - testing new settings i can see why he has to change his settings, csgo or workshop tho?"
754727,but he always prefire that spot!
754743,because we haven't even busted the whole baguette cartel.
754761,"sure, because only detected cheaters are cheaters."
754788,"yeah, because get rekt, fkin noob, pwnd and so forth are oh so valuable in the english language..."
754805,"please, it added gameplay depth having to spam flash heal rank 3 because it was superior to rank 5."
754814,if you can't trust the government then who can you trust?
754817,yes because he obviously was talking about normal games and anyone gives a fuck about normals
754821,such as frightening away the local groms with a glowing creeper face that hisses?
754824,eyes can't see above 10fps anyway
754842,"oh, i forgot attack speeds, qs, and crits were removed in 4.20."
754861,if only fiff was there to throw the flashes and smokes then they could've held b ct side on overpass
754926,it'll be the heart of a new born baby...
754946,if you just keep opening cases then i'm pretty sure you'll afford it one day judging by the massive profit it grants!
754962,"yeah, hunters sure got it rough so far this expansion!"
754983,"poor east coast, i mean its only 4 am so i have to get to work soon i mean if it would be 1 am it wouldn't be worth to go to sleep so atleast i can stay awake the whole night"
755025,"great, now i can get scammed again!"
755031,looks like your going to have to make an analysis of your analysis of your analysis video.
755092,so is wow based on comments that you see on the internet
755110,"to be honest, about 13% of that 15% average is because of launch xbox 360s."
755128,"ahh yes, x3 frag, spawn traps, jug, sooo much fun"
755236,why try things when i can just ask and have someone else tell me?
755259,yeah cause it's so hard to manipulate them via ps ...
755272,"he's funny to play against, there this whole minigame of when will trynda randomly win lane with a crit in the middle of a decisive trade"
755275,but hey it took a lot of skill right
755278,"the correct solution is to represent real numbers with strings, because we know what a success that's been with php's bignums."
755430,how does it feel being brainwashed by the patriarchy?
756157,"well, they are the elite that has nothing to hide."
756305,"yh, my players say differently but your opinion must be right considering how you know so much about me"
756466,"it's true, i started winning a lot more after paying for hax"
756716,why is the gif 30 minutes long?
756731,the sun is always brighter if you teach a man to fish and have all your ducks in a row.
756736,he didn't roam and get a kill under turret in top lane?
756924,"yes please, steel is all sunshine and rainbows"
757018,"well at least you know it's not riots fault, they're being throttled and slowed down the evil isps how could any client shittyness or networking issues be their fault, i mean it's not like the client is platformed on adobe air in 2015"
757065,you can't get better after 2 months
757258,"i'm glad they zoomed in, i never would have noticed the shadows otherwise"
757408,"um hey man, your vid isn't in 4k, so i don't know why you got 4k in the title"
757571,"if it was polygon then that makes sense, because all games are silly, of course."
757614,"yeah, this is something totally new to league of legends."
757649,"they should only match players with the same amount of games and mmr, 100 games vs 100 games, 101 vs 101, same mmr, champ pool, cs, average game time etc"
757728,"yeah, that's absolutely why my smurf got vacced and not my main."
757743,"obviously the marginal upgrade from what's already a top tier cpu is worth 150fps, duh, pay attention"
757879,"with ekko getting movementspeed + slowing the enemy + dealing damage to them, can vayne's silver bolts get a similar system?"
757885,is he going to give away all of his skins to hide evidence?
758124,no riot is shit the company sucks ass now give moar skins so i can still waste my mom's money on it ty
758228,rumor: final fantasy 7 remake this year!
758238,"they're still making a killing, why fix it?"
758270,yeah because after you have all the champions and 20k ip sitting in your account whats the point in playing.
758339,"yep, being better than 90% of the player base is definitely garbage"
758344,thanks to riot i've been able to load into game with my health and mana bars completely black!
758361,oh whatever they took care of you guys in kingdom hearts 2
758371,we need more annie and ezreal skins.
758430,pros don't know about this gun and never tried
758459,"no dude, item diversity needs a complete revamp, so lets completely change everything we know about it and make the bf sword of ap's cost 1250 ap, without a strong and steady study on the pbe beforehand"
758481,yea it acts all weird and puts me on a 5 minute time out.
758510,"well, everything has hidden microphones embedded in them anyway, just use one of them."
758511,i thought there was russian and na servers only?
758524,i guess fury is a 200 series gpu then
758543,he just has a very good headset.
758563,"seriously, your english too good for a russian, please stop giving me good images of russians so i can whine about them more ingame!"
758612,it takes them 6 years to make a game so you just need to wait a few more years (still buy every bad port till then) and the problem will be fixed
758654,"this game is so bad, developers has to pay the users to play the game wow."
758658,might as well stop supports from taking ignite too while you're at it.
758659,because memories fade the second you sell your old stuff.
758670,yeah i should be ashamed of myself for putting 16+ hours last week in a bad game
758722,"no, i thought that this champion was a totally new idea never saw before in the video game world."
758810,a bunch of angry gamers in one place... that's such a good idea
758843,ty now delete this fast so no one sees this
758857,"yup this is more money grubbing scheme by the californian water companies, shame for techland to sunk this low."
758862,"yeah, they barely break even right?"
758912,uhh that quarter final vs h2k was really close right?
758922,agreed marin that game 1 so fucking hard getting caught every minute
759035,i'm glad they brought survival down a peg they were dominating all my raids
759041,fucking scum you cheated in minecraft you are probably cheating in cs just kill yourself
759051,can't wait to finally see all the raid in 10 weeks...
759113,**fuck that shit / baby**
759283,"come on, it would be a totally small superfair buff to xerath if he got an ms boost for ccing and opponent!"
759284,you don't think coast can beat tsm or tip?
759412,so you're saying having rng in a strategy-based game is bad?
759413,because udyr was really popular when he got an ultimate skin.
759483,any analyst would laugh and tell you peec gaming is dying don't be an moron.
759618,if you don't like a post you downvote it so no one else can see it right?
759647,don't be silly shes working as intended
759704,"sony can't be evil, i give them my money!"
759710,let's make aram not random anymore!
759721,lol i used to 1v2 people top lane with garen all the time... i guess he was way too op as well.
759743,"but dont you just love the forced puns, i mean so funny"
759775,"i love the item squish in wod, in mop you ran around with like 400k hp and now finally after the squish you are nearly running around with 399k hp, yay"
759801,let's make all series bo11 then to be absolutely sure the better team goes through.
759802,"its fine, if you get a 30$ drop, doesn't even matter."
759860,no wonder they left him hanging after a match!
759904,the exception that proves the rule
759913,champs without abusable gap closers so like six?
759925,"well why wouldn't you, it gives you armor against the opposing adc and it gives you damage to counter him."
759956,buying weed is a scam because it's illegal to sell weed.
759997,oh nooo that .05 ap ratio off of her ultimate spells will totally dumpster her.
760007,but look at me i am so good at this game since i don't use music
760021,"no, i think only ahri should have quote if she kill baron or dragon"
760044,i swear that i'd be lem if we had 128 servers.
760111,"wow, na'vi is throwing, they all tried to knife him."
760150,scalpers can't touch the stock because everything is sold out.
760184,"nono, this is fake guys, there isn't scripting in league."
760211,0 smokes used in the entire competition
760229,but she's so skill-intensive champion you need to know how to play her to make her effective
760239,yeah just walk that broken leg off
760256,"duh, because it's saturday and on saturdays rito is literally hitler."
760258,you have to highlight the white text to find the part about sacrificing children in the name of riot.
760274,it's actually an alien from outer space which happens to closely resemble the look of female humans
760283,the skill curve for becoming a pro interviewer is just way higher
760286,"yes, corridor shooters and linear rpgs are the only alternative"
760293,it's people like you that rub it in after...
760303,it would be cool if she had bonus stats while shes in river
760312,i play ahri jungle and she is clearly the most nerfed
760329,pretty sure riven is still viable
760390,scream ride not enough for you?
760391,fuck you bro consoles are so fucking cheep!
760409,"yeah, valve has a great track record caring about fans."
760433,call phone agents nooo!
760469,so game changing you should probably forego the upgrade to prevent the unfavorable gold trade
760526,do you really want this instead of another raid tier (or facebook integration)?
760552,but remember the game lacked content and absolutely not worth full price.
760578,because i'm sure an hour of a mmo game gives you such a great handle on the issues.
760594,"3rd q should clearly do no damage, as well as root yasuo to the ground and cut his ad by 75%"
760596,who doesn't love a good 14-1 side though?
760649,well then i guess fingers crossed for a remake of new vegas on ps4.
760692,you mean my knife doesn't make me better?
760724,and what a smooth launch it was.
760791,"don't worry, you'll be able to buy the red and black chroma pack for just 590 rp!"
760793,that is not possible it has 3.5 gigs of ram!
760809,yeah and so should teemo's q if you hit a shroom.
760819,blaze rod fuel can't melt iron blocks!
760837,yeah that definitely had everything to do with announcer packs and nothing to do with the fact ea is run by complete idiots.
760838,"yeah, cause no one in all of north america, which includes mexico, watches anything else besides football."
760885,"blitz has a phantom dancer, everything is working as intended."
760940,are you joking why would riot buff champions instead of nerfing because having all champons in a certain role being useless is great for the game
760948,"yeah, jinx was only good for her ult"
760970,"no, that's not a *real* fps, because it's a nintendo game!"
760972,the fact that she was a female and attractive is clearly enough evidence that she's a groupie and only whoring herself out for views and using charlie for money
760978,why not just have a windows 95 vm?
760993,"cataclysm was the end result of trying to make everyone happy, and we all see how well that worked out."
760998,"when i use my tax software, i really care the developer enjoyed what he was doing and made sure to thoroughly craft it out"
761035,"come on guys, can't you see that it resembles a pornstars asshole?"
761107,"yes because making a petition, boycotting valve, and giving bad reviews to skyrim is *totally* the way to change things."
761145,its becuz of rank inflation u fuckin noob
761149,"i have a feeling they were going to implement it at some point (it happened with tf2, after all) but chose to focus on more important aspects of the game like adding sticker capsules."
761183,"what, no... reddits always knows first!"
761185,because rekkles singlehandedly caused the downfall of elements?
761186,"sorry, should have included the"
761234,"man, sony should just move christmas to this weekend so people can play the game they already have on the system they already own with the psn+ they already subscribed to."
761241,haven't seen this a million bloody times.
761268,the acting in that game was flawless.
761339,that's what you get for using a *mac*.
761346,so that's what happens to skin profits...
761423,dont let noobs keep you down op
761458,meanwhile valve is fucking up everything with every new patch
761463,i dunno $70 seems a little low...
761465,b-but all pc gamers are fat virgin nerds...
761473,"iirc they just didnt put it in, cuz yano, racing games dont need that sort of thing"
761538,you're not challenger why are you here please gtfo you're ruining my high elo conversations.
761539,it's time for you to update the prescription on your glasses :\^)
761559,but matchmaking sucks and always puts the trolls on my team
761566,riot keeps sexualising their releases and showing time and time again why they are ruining the esports scene
761597,"at what spot, you didn't even put the ct in the picture."
761601,liquids logo is so much better..
761610,because that aoe slow and aoe snare ult is less reliable than cait's traps.
761647,"looks like the knife is causing your fps to be low, if you trade it to me i can see whether it improves fps :)"
761660,this 1/16th of a second is what is keeping him from getting ge!
761672,"the thread about faker flirting is so much more relevant to lol, though"
761673,"because he is from na, and everyone in na are inoffensive lambs who have never uttered an insult, ever."
761690,oh yes... more types of controllers is *exactly* what i want from nintendo
761751,ranked only mode that matters every other mode are for filthy casuals
761766,i think he is legit just the 64tick or something
761786,something your mmr is shit
761796,oh no plat 1 whatever will you do
761804,this game should get an hd remake
761846,"that's probably because you didn't take enough cs from your adc, how else are you gonna 1v5 because you didn't get mid?"
761860,"yeah fnatic is playing so badly, they will disband"
761924,"easy i do this 300 times a day in bronze, nothing special here"
761936,no but obviously we are being hateful when we discuss the performance of players in the game thread.
761938,"these are the things, that make this game unplayable"
761970,how dare you not kick out a veteran raider for him!
761974,yeah rogues and mages can do that fos
762002,you are the reason arcades died out.
762044,"no, and i'll do that and ill also play kalista first time ranked :)"
762068,"yeah, shiphtur split with crumbzz to go back to nintendudex."
762118,"see, when i was in grade school we called that a topic sentence."
762120,i heard it was gonna be next month's gwg
762138,"go fuck yourself with that attitude, dearie."
762151,i was too busy feeling incredibly legendary while doing this quest to notice.
762155,"yea, triple q was so fun to play against"
762189,"oh yeah, those automated bots will totally be able to bring up his transaction history."
762191,gaben personal mail is the steam support
762198,because america have never gotten involved in foreign issues.
762212,it's because too many people illegally download their games
762282,"of course they will, why would ea have pc developers develop anything for pc"
762289,yea or maybe they need an extra time for an extreme huge patch
762293,and next someone tells that every battlefield/cod/whatever are the exact same game?
762297,it's so weird that you like that game; most people never give it a chance.
762314,itll also turn your gpu into a convienent space heater!
762355,no but guyz the dfg got removed so this is obviously a buff
762356,"no, we need minimalistic artwork from all the maps and angles because then we will make more karma than ever before!"
762369,global elites are mgs with hacks
762372,yes but is the artwork original?
762392,"no need to be rude man, he just wants to know the name!"
762446,imagine the numbers of faceit impersonators show up at your door to 'inspect' and seize your pc/csgo inventory in suspicion of cheating.
762447,"yeah their last nerf with leaving his ult stacks on for 20 seconds made him completely unviable, just like reddit said"
762477,"if it was in 1.6, it is automatically good"
762489,"i love it, totally worth getting boosted to get promoted to an elo where you lose the game and ruin it for the players that are there legitimately"
762503,"pfft, any excuse for the corporation huh!"
762528,html is most definitely a programming language.
762532,yes because draenei clearly want to be in the same faction with orcs
762551,maybe you should have queued for marquis instead.
762559,because he is actually a silver 1.
762587,yeah god it's like they expect being able to fucking dodge stuff to be reasonable counter-play.
762594,"but i wanna do my gp ap jangle and my ap master le jangle, rito pls buff my jangle chartcrs."
762634,-2 new maps added to pool and will be used during katowice
762663,thrall didn't steal the kill... let's just say he accidentally tagged him first
762737,"yeah, fuck that guy for having an opinion!"
762761,i'm glad you tried to save sovor some professionalism by trying to actually take in my opinion and respond to that instead of going back to personal jist and ridicule.
762773,"take up mining, get a bunch of gold ore, then smelt it into coins."
762829,"of course, things change every year with clg, and for the better too!"
762844,"didn't you know, 14th century icelandic people copyrighted their sagas and other literature."
762847,next thing you're going to tell me to not always press the second q on lee sin.
762858,yea my 10 year old toshiba dlp that had great reviews at the time was a piece of shit
762928,"yeah let's add new features right before huge tournaments, great idea, totally didn't backfire the last time valve tried that..."
762935,i guess the technology just isn't there yet.
763066,"what didnt you know, shadow island is closely related to old japan tales !"
763080,"in ocarina of time there was the infinite sword glitch, they didn't catch that bug!"
763089,who is this adil guy you are talking about?
763114,"yeah, i bet u and the other 2 guys that play garen can relate"
763163,i expected a piece of fried chicken when i read lucian
763184,please re-install windows and try again.
763210,"from hardware lol and they're going to patch their software to fix the issue, makes sense"
763212,yeah those koreans are do overrated.
763259,"bad rats is a pretty good game, in my honest opinion."
763264,but when we say we're going to rape you it just means in game
763293,if someone is that invested in leaving games... i say they've earned it.
763321,"yeah, anybody who's ever looked down on somebody like hitler should feel bad, you never met them!"
763350,in other new people are calling for far cry 4 to be removed from stores because of its depiction of women.
763354,let's just assume it said eu &amp;gt; na
763381,"oh nooo, then we would have to sue steel for fraud!1"
763392,the real value comes from grinding them hundreds of times in hopes of a rare drop that will allow you to grind it hundreds of times more!
763420,he absolutely never played max level
763433,did you know dreamhack admins gave flusha cheats?
763436,yea masters on euw is full of lighthearted banter and there's no serious insults whatsoever
763442,"yes, this is exactly what they intended."
763509,i thought the pirate bay icon made it more authentic!
763546,my undertones class buffed every other op class nerfed.
763550,here take this it's dangerous out there
763552,this is the exact attitude that makes you a better player.
763612,yeah i totally didn't expect that!
763640,yeah that will likely never happen again
763642,"but man what the fuck i got pubstomped by riven, i died 5 times 1v1 in the first 3 minutes how isnt that junglers fault?"
763650,yeah it's totally fair to punish people because the game is so buggy that thousands of users can't connect only find it out once they start a match.
763656,riot is really busy with the replay system i know
763699,well at least they fixed voice chat in the lobby
763703,yeah its bull i can't play my snes carts on my wiiu!
763710,cassio q move speed so op please give ad assasins some sticking power
763720,thats a pretty normal interesting idea and maybe that is what theyre doing but covered it up with fake dragon/kill timers
763746,"it's okay man, only .01% of people are ever toxic, and there has literally only ever been one false positive in the history of riot reporting, so there is no way this automatic system could ever fail."
763758,"naw dude, if someone is toxic in chat the smartest thing to do is to be toxic back to show everyone that my internet feelings are hurt by some random stranger on the internet, who means absolutely **nothing** to me."
763760,"loool, just a good headset, you know nothung about the game, noob"
763793,no dude its bad cuz everybody else says that if i pick off meta ill get kicked
763986,"yes, we obviously never have server issues 'cause our infrastructure so good"
764111,"no, they never did anything in the past so why would they bother this time?"
764927,but why keep it free when people will obviously pay for it everytime!
765048,"but there's an ea logo on the case, so obviously that's the focus."
765196,"heimerdinger, those turrets are op man."
765311,i'm not sure what's wrong with your friend... i think this is a flawless proof that shows the new reform system does not work.
765571,well obviously they have lives and earn money since they don't have time to get better at the game and instead cheat
765602,but don't forget to make it boe so all the new gold buyers don't qq.
765635,we should make knives affected by gravity so they fall when you fail the animation and you have to pick it up!
765793,looks like i need to get an amd card!
765795,so you're saying you support delivery mechanisms not companies
765964,becusse they dont have a pc hehe
766028,tip: give me your ip and i will protect it with my own internet
766038,they should make his w into a skill shot
766175,"just like piglet is a shitter, at least based on initial performance"
766190,"yeah, hang on let me just dig through years of boxes for cd keys for them..."
766207,"yes, i'm sure the teams will play the game for reddits entertainment and not to win the game cleanly"
766247,"no, because the xbox one is sooo much better than the ps4"
766416,"dude, you need to pull down your crosshair when you spray."
766424,"yes, i watch esports in daily basis and i live in fucking antartica"
766446,this is reddit where we downvote when we disagree with someone!
766500,"on the 22nd of june, it will be 4 years since yorick been played by anyone anywhere."
766596,a friend i played with a bunch used to think that kayle was a man because anyone in a full suit of armor is definitely a dude.
766665,i wonder if these were posted before?
766733,it's almost like we can't watch the games and see if the teams play well or not...
766783,you think only he can get the game to work?
766864,because $30 for the game is a fucking travesty
766914,if there's one word i would use to describe jin air it would be successful.
766938,they just can't help but copy us lol players however they can
766939,but he's not played in lcs so he's trash!
766969,but the spray pattern is easy as the ak he just needs more time put into it.
766972,all the hardcore gamers i know read forbes.
767056,that moment you forget to switch off ffa mode for your aimbot.
767069,yeah he learned that if the enemy team throws hard enough you can win from a massive deficit
767085,"i don't think most french players are like him, just the french in general."
767180,there's no reason for; leblanc's q viktor q
767188,"buttt they're playing with desi, it's obv desi"
767322,"yeah, fuck those preachy vegans taking things seriously and bringing up veganism when its nothing to do with what everyone is talking about"
767325,yeah just like your smart phone...
767329,yes especially the vehicle physics
767333,"it's fine, no one can hit you if you just sidestep a little."
767336,glad i wasn't the only one to notice this
767370,"i started playing him this patch and won a lot, it must be me."
767386,yeah you cant have brain and muscle
767387,yeah you are cant you just kill yourself and donate all your property to charity you cheating scum
767389,"ye, being one-tapped by globals will help you improve when you're like gold nova"
767453,it's not fun if there's no gear
767581,"i think he has a nadehack, the he landed perfectly on the 3 guys"
767614,"sure, what's your very important security info stranger?"
767696,"you're asking too much of the devs, they obviously have more important matters to attend to."
767741,oh man this joke will never get old.
767745,"but what about when the camera angle is at a slightly higher clash of clans type view, and the game has a slightly different art style?"
767760,"i want food that automatically chews itself, riot pls"
767891,well technically it's a loading overlay.
767945,because they need to spend their time making path blocks!
767978,right because no one has ever been interested in an athlete because of his history outside the game
768137,"nah shuttle is the epitome of the above comment, always so rude and british"
768171,yes because next friday is spring 2016.
768200,"such original joke, like everything else you've managed to say."
768229,there are so many things you can blame your defeat in silver and your skill cant be one of them
768283,with the player being annoying and the champion a turd
768340,omg gnars ult is so unreliable don't play him.
768358,"yeah there's totally no new game modes that were made specifically for hardline or new gadgets, vehicles, and upgrades."
768447,"yeah guys, why would you waste ip on champs when you can buy champs with rp?"
768498,better idea put them in silver 1 :d
768510,but think of all those sexy pokemon hentai mods.
768539,wow that really sucks man i hope you learned your lesson.
768550,"faker can't carry, you heard it here first guys."
768566,"vel'koz is that turret thing that nobody buys, right?"
768593,i'm sure that will help coasts public image.
768605,"yeah because no one rapidly clicks while playing this game, why would there be stutters when you alternate clicking on a champion/clicking on the ground?"
768634,yeah the frntpage is filled with high quality posts as we speak.
768710,yeah because a tie-breaker that automatically relegates the losing team is lame.
768723,"|it's an online video game , using it as a sheild to say whatever the fuck you want is all part of it ftfy"
768750,have you forgotten that he is immune to all criticism because he has reported correctly on some line-up changes?
768756,urf coming back for halloween confirmed!
768771,telling a suicidal person to kill himself is such good exposure for the community
768774,"its not like the meta is changing or anything, the champ just got good, yeah thats it, urgot was always good and when i shit on him in lane it was the enemy that didnt know how to play, yeah thats it"
768805,but praise the almighty nintendo overlords for their merciful release of the wiiu and remakes of all our favourite games.
768859,i won't be satisfied until a full tinkers construct-esque weapon system is implemented.
768861,we can just teleport into this guy's room to show who's boss for not fixing a bug!
768929,he is so good but he is stuck in elo hell man
769047,every player on elements (the roster with nyph) went to s4 worlds look how they dominated
769072,get out of here with your logic.
769073,"damn, you sure got him, that guy's super toxic."
769074,"don't argue to me whether he is legit or not, tell him to submit a steam support ticket, email every cs go developer, email gabe newell, contact the local authority and press, argue with those people, cause that's going to get him unbanned, right?"
769089,because with the internet who wants actual people to laugh and drink with in the same room while they game
769093,"yeah, i bet riot doesn't even know how big their game is"
769227,it auto unbinds if you bind the key to something else... only scrubs dont know that
769249,report him for being an unethical ganker
769259,nah i think the real fix would be to replace all square blocks with extrautilities's impossible object.
769266,i like that you recorded this with your phone.
769276,shiphtur replacing hai confirmed ...
769294,"yeah, the human eye cannot see more than 24 fps anyways."
769303,yeah man sejuani and amumu were absolute garbage before 5.5 and would become utterly worthless if cinderhulk was changed slightly
769435,"nerf adcs, they are way too strong."
769466,"damn, how did you figure that out?"
769496,"yeah right, because creators/engineers/artists/etc being able to be compensated for their work has ruined every other market and only reduced the quality of products."
769497,"that's because we asked for this game mode to remain permanent so many times, riot could not ignore it."
769505,"no, everything should be made for the lowest common denominator so they don't feel bad."
769557,"yeah, because people hitting the form up, then downloading the file, has less server impact than just letting people download the file."
769562,but the synergy with your w attackspeed!
769598,yeah those 180 lines make all the difference
769609,"but don't you know, even if he was making 100% he would be an sell-out traitor to the community"
769655,same man i'm only like 20 ranks away stupid broken elo
769696,love versing aram only accounts that are grouped as 5.
769721,your the reason pc gaming is dying
769736,because it's easier to put the mouse on the item than to click 1.
769740,we've already seen how great a system like this works in dota..
769747,"yeah microsoft is watching op on facebook with the kinect, so watch out op."
769751,of course you cis-males wouldn't understand us trans dragon-kin you shitlords
769809,inb4 warowl gets dmca claim for stealing the name and idea from valve's pro tip series.
769881,yeah they should give everyone a brand new $60 game on their birthday!
769923,"yea because you know, no other raid has lasted over a year and pvp has always been perfectly balanced."
769927,"oh yeah, so many hackers in silver!"
769957,gotta keep up with those monk nerfs.
770041,atleast i have a team that doesn't drop me
770078,"mmm yes, i can't wait to play my destro/aff lock now!"
770102,"i bet you're right, valve is probably super scared that people might understand their ranking system for cs:go."
770108,"i bet it was cgi, i hear that's pretty good nowadays."
770146,yay so now all there employees have something to do since they aren't remodeling the client
770158,youll get banned gg skins im sorry for ur loss
770187,"oh man, how has no one done this before?"
770195,"but hey, froggen getting shit on by hai at the same tourney doesn't really matter right?"
770209,nah smurfs only exist on the other team.
770218,lolz...n00bz you can re-spec a whole 3 timez now!
770220,yeah because tf stun is so similar to old syndra
770269,like games for windows live 2.0?
770294,i don't have friends that play often enough or at the same time that i trust being on a team with.. especially with my challenger mechanics they just can't keep up with me so they hold me back
770302,oh no you have to wait a whole hour to open your phone to complete a 10 second task?
770325,"my monitor is only 60hz but clearly i want my gpu to render hundreds of frames per second, increasing usage, temperatures, and wattage for those extra frames in between the ones my monitor actually shows."
770337,tristana main coming through (i have an ap build too)
770338,"thank god we have an ama schedule, resources list and free champ rotation on display"
770408,please i'm bronze and i can do better.
770423,"yeah, because all bots are stolen credit cards and stolen accounts."
770450,that wouldn't even buy me one razer keyboard
770478,"black shield, xpecial confirmed racist and insecure about his manhood!"
770499,but arcade has pixels and dj has bass!
770506,"ot hiko is the mastermind of this whole twrowing deal, scamming everyone out of skind and smellie is his partner, masking the transfers as donations"
770560,yeah they are really moving forward into the 21^st century
770600,"yeah, but why does it have to be muh main?"
770637,"right, that's why veigar is such a feared and popular pick."
770652,"no, the physics just perfectly line up to create funny animations sometimes"
770654,yah at the age if thirteen we are all so innocent
770690,nonono see we must buy more dlc to support the developers so this problem does not happen again!
770698,no it's obvious esea are in on it and greedy assholes!
770711,fish mobs so that the squids can eat them?
770713,obviously because it isn't a cheap asiimov ripoff
770720,except guys like us who have actually shot guns before and are therefore are experts in all things gun and those who have never fired guns should not be allow to comment on anything related to firearms ever even in their relationship to videogames.
770759,"lemme guess, you also have 2 295x2's in crossfire?"
770760,"and while you're at it, i wanna play league on my phone, too."
770764,great job contributing since i discuss both patches.
770771,"yes being upset about day 1 dlc is the equivalent of being upset about gay marriage, how did i not see how ridiculous i'm being until now."
770816,"apparently it is, look at the upvotes."
770843,"yeah but valve is protecting you from them by not allowing you to sell your items for a week,or in dota 2 case,for 3 months."
770875,"well.. he kind of is, thats why he got stuck in epsilon after the tossup."
770881,"nah...vizi, odoamne, cabo are all trash because they aren't on a top 3 team"
770885,don't you dare underestimate his gangplank!
770905,and i'm glad you took the time to read the article and look at krepos photo.
770919,"you can coach people there, not just apply for coaching, you self-centered prick."
770935,this is why we shouldn't play on a console
770979,yes fnatic vs sk was totally how you discribe it
771003,"depends on what champion you're playing, it's bm to dance as shaco after a kill for example"
771006,"for that reason, veigar is a high contested pick in the lcs and in soloq"
771010,good gud bestbuy: letting unfortunate ustomers use the store wi-fi for their game download.
771051,and the replay system comes with new client.. so very soon
771113,"well, you had a good run... time to call it quits."
771133,i prefer crouching and then jumping tbh
771166,because a huge multinational company making shit tons of products not just ps4's would have less than a thousand employees anyway
771191,"yeah, because targeting 20 year olds and ruining their lives is an incredibly simple solution which will bode well for a company"
771199,yeah those viewers definitely would have been watching gosu instead if only she dressed more modestly
771212,because na challenger is so serious
771234,but what about all the trash talk he did during second split last season?
771254,"* tl;dr: ocelote's manager sucks ftfy also, those 5 minutes of smalltalk obviously happened beacause he despises you, not because he needs to give attention to other fans."
771269,"man, 3 days and exactly 2 matches was the best alpha experience i've ever had."
771340,because soloq = how good you are competitively
771345,but there is a link between video games and misogyny.
771361,"yeah, bischu had a really nice ap build!"
771394,i can't think of anything funner than going to a grammar boot camp.
771406,because games like cod require high skill level.
771417,but leveling in video games is serious business!
771420,"yea it is bad, make it drop to few bucks now pls"
771451,"said it before say it again, i am so glad i didn't take vacation time for this..."
771473,"yeah, only punish people, don't reward them."
771505,clearly they got paid to say that.
771513,wow that's worth the year plus wait...
771523,as a hunter i approve his message.
771527,hey aren't you that travis guy who does all those funny interviews with doublelift?
771544,because the league pick-ban requires sooo much thought!
771572,"because the microphone would bring production costs up to $4 per unit, and that's just ridiculous"
771596,yeah farming that perfectly is too easy!
771639,it's really not even a video game if you actually think about it.
771674,"* i guess you could say he...died...if you catch my drift * ffs tank the thing im dying you idiot * don't worry guys, (x champion) can just 1v5 them later, so he doesn't need to fight with us."
771697,he's obviously resetting his mouse while he hears the footsteps of the other team

778542,so says the guy who said people must be paid to watch something that wasnt an attack at all.
778559,"yes, because obviously na mids are much better than eu mids on average."

778747,thank god they made ferocious bite better.
778758,"nice try dude but this is reddit, where everything is black or white and you're a troll for suggesting otherwise"
778766,because ea would never kill a fan favorite franchise
778769,"except for the waggle controls, apparently."
778800,but my pitch fork was primed and ready!
778900,so they can't create smurf with the same id n# then smurfing is considered identity theft!
778973,who needs communication when you can aim
778975,wonder how many raid tiers this costs
779049,"what, you dont wait until you're challenger tier to start ranked?"
779062,guess that means only china should get the lunar revel stuff and we better make sure other regions don't get any harrowing skins/icons because that's from 'murica...
779071,"yeah, i mean don't you carry your computer everywhere you go?"
779076,yeah $15 for a single monster is exactly how it should be done.
779093,none of this sounds difficult to code either!
779095,"yes, because twitter is really hard to understand."
779126,and his english has improved so much too!
779130,"on the bright side, they are buffing low mobility mid laners!"
779184,can't wait for the voice messaging app...
779214,but xbox live always crashes on a tuesday!
779251,looking forward to my twitter integration!
779267,"dude you should be running non stop with p90, bottom frag scrub!"
779305,"because there are so many other 1080p/60fps console racers with hundreds of cars making it look bad, right?"
779329,because kass has very good mobility that nidalee and leblanc can't keep up with
779333,good thing we skipped current gen then!
779336,"sure, maybe just make them show on a currency tab instead."
779353,swirly particles in planetside 2. huzzah.
779404,"no man if korean/chinese player is laning vs western player, western player is always behind 100 cs and 10 deaths"

779597,nope everyone who isn't at least plat 1 sucks donky balls and should feel bad
779598,holy shit you're sooo good
779619,those were made in japan so they're shit.
779624,i look forward to doing your mom.
779637,you should delete all of system32 just to be safe
779639,because they are bad journalists.
779657,"school is not important, a gold elo will open you every door in the world"
779664,"yup, he posted a picture of a creeper peering in through his bathroom window, he certainly is the biggest of all the douchesin this world."
779697,"especially the scaling ones suck in the late game, right ?"
779723,so you've met some guys with good headsets and great gamesense?
779726,but everything is a conspiracy!
779783,well then maybe next time they'll add a $1.50 onto the base price since it's no big deal.
779785,giant blown up low resolution pixelated gamer pics would look super sleek and modern!
779792,it is way easier to throw stones at this guy instead of doing anything ourselves.
779817,maybe they should turn it into an mmo?
779827,chrono trigger was such a hidden gem
779840,make a confession why you still can and say you only messed around with it in pub servers
779841,i'm tired of all these review in progresses from ign with fc4 it took 3 days with the ps4 it took a whole year just post it when it's ready!
779889,wow that's a cool zelda picture
779910,"no bro, they *owe him compensation* for not getting him that free demo when they said they would!"
779926,"hmmm... i wonder why... i wanna destroy the environment and not give any fucks about balance of nature, so we shall war against our own troll-bro's!!!"
779998,because he had no script for ahri
780040,but then he cant stream fulltime anymore
780042,"hey, it's a beta, they'll work on it"
780059,"if you look hard enough, there are servers exactly like this in the community servers..."
780065,certainly nothing to be paranoid about in america.
780081,"yes, because all pc players are cheaters, and we never had to deal with hackers/glitchers on consoles, right?"
780138,"yeah reddit would *never* produce those kinds of comments, right?"
780154,that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard
780187,yeah just stop scripting and it will stop
780207,so easy it just needs you to have 9 alt accounts able to play draft as well as 10 computers
780230,you mean you (and mostly everyone else) dont have the raid 100% finished on its second week being out?
780239,oh yeah cuz racist humor is awesome
780242,"but we just need to learn how to count our combo points, then we will unlock our unlimited power"
780243,i don't think you can get xp from diorite.
780290,because never talking about something is totally how you get things changed
780292,"no don't do it riot, you will be removing skill from the game and all the people who aren't good as others with map control will now be on par with the skilled players etc."
780325,"man, smurfs are just amazing players and should feel proud of carrying"
780398,unskilled player because i don't deserve bronze and they are bad.
780400,"nice argumentation, you convinced me"
780421,we should be like baseball and have a world championship for only 1 country
780425,it's obvious flusha shared his hacks with the rest of the team so he doesn't look suspicious anymore.
780428,beating bronze na players is so funny
780435,so after i've died 6 times 1v1 i should go again because 7 is also a lucky number?
780456,i dont think we've seen enough katarina
780482,the logic of this comment is astronomical
780490,what if i download more ram for my pc?
780517,oh look another female team formed on looks that's going to work
780520,i hope this is as good as the run.
780536,"even if you try to say something to them, they will report you for flame and you'll be banned."
780540,i rather have dank skins and unboxing turnament than gameplay fixes
780548,we'd rather play with flamers than trolls good to know someone can speak on my behalf without knowing my opinion.
780559,yes because 15 dollars for a high grade skin is a steal.
780756,because this fucking reg oh my god.
780945,why have a dkc movie when there's already the masterpiece of the tv show!
780967,"poor pasha, nip is now antichrist"
780973,disagreeing with the people that pay the bills is certainly a very good idea and will help progress the game !
781321,b-but it makes ppl go and raep grills!
781858,you should file a dmca complaint
782011,"much worse than ekko with his slows, speed ups, aoe stuns and nukes, executes and ranged harass"
782012,meanwhile graves and lucian are garbage tier for the same reason
782021,some filthy casuals don't take counter strike seriously...
782283,the +++ posts were real quality
782527,"it's super easy to fix and takes 5 minutes, except they don't care."
782573,i can't wait to hear those bzzz sounds once again!
782643,its so much easier to tell someone to uninstall the game then having to type it
782700,i will only buy if the fish swim away from the dog.
782706,good thing there's no aoe fights this expansion.
782810,i heard they can pick enemy party chat with the planes.
782825,finger on trigger... what a noob.
782851,"yeah dude i only watch streams so i can read up on the newest websites that help me be a more epic gamer&amp;memer, i don't get why people don't like ads and want gameplay only."
782884,of course no 20yo male would want to have sex with a 40yo woman... ewww... gross...
782892,it is just a video of cute puppies.
782992,yay another survival game in early-access
783073,"like pawn, the fourth best player on edg right ?"
783116,this is definitely 100% a quality post 10/10
783271,they didn't have social media so they could do what the want as long as there were no witnesses.
783313,"i am gonna get a lot of flak for this, but loads of games have done this way before witcher 3, but people can't see past the hype and keep praising witcher 3 as the best game ever, it is a good game but it is not the only game to have done a variety of things."
783378,no wonder the game has taken forever they left only one guy working on it
783462,that will enhance performance for sure
783528,don't you know it's against the internet to like kotaku now
783535,rito is literally not owned by tencent in any way.
783568,hey i played league before not now you skrub!
783579,well obviously you aren't kennys... you actually hit your shots
783580,"the devil is in the details: helios said he wants to *go* to worlds, not that he wanted to *win* worlds."
783586,"but they just ported the characters, lazy nintendo"
783654,yay another military shoot em up.
783668,oh boy i get map packs first yay
783669,at least we got sweet tooth into a soccer with cars.
783696,yes but i don't think you understand did he actually kill a teammate
783755,they will release more chroma and skins dont you read ff?
783776,who wants to listen to a bunch of koreans who can't even speak english?
783789,let's withdraw every nintendo character from smash and make it 100% 3rd party
783793,because indy games are never buggy.
783837,"in other words, he's a fictional character... hahahaha omg lol"
783863,aaand you're doxxed.
783899,i'm a feminist and i find this offensive as it contributes to rape culture.

783955,"yeah, getting 1v1'd in pro play is definitely not getting outclassed hard."
783984,you only matter when your feelings align with the majority.
784007,"dude it doesn't matter, he wasted flash"
784026,because we obviously watch videos about gaming on youtube duh!
784031,"yeah, it's not like his w doesn't do crazy damage, like at all, it's definitely all turrets."
784032,yea because it was op in 1.6 and css
784078,"nvidia addressed concerns with gameworks hurting amd performance, by instead fixing it so amd cards are the only ones that can run the game."
784096,working on skins definitely inhibits them from doing any other work on the game
784098,"hurray for living with other people, that way i don't feel bad about not being able to do that since i only own headphones."
784160,"who knows, maybe there is more than meets the eye"
784193,because incarnati0n is why c9 is doing badly
784236,i bet if they announced this at e3 it would have softened the blow
784259,oh and... maybe we should call it unranked competitive matchmaking.. wow qq
784295,i bet ke$ha and deadmau5 are your favorite artists.
784329,"yeah, 10 minutes is enough time to get familiar with a *survival* game."
784336,omg it's the tumblr sad frog me.
784345,yeah i totally play my pc games at 720p
784372,"yeah man, when i'm running through combat irl and i take two shots to the chest from a glock i dont even flinch"
784404,"faker got to top 10 kr challenger with just 2 rune pages, why are you just plat?"

784544,glad this community is so open and helpful
784582,a case a day keeps the... oh wait what actual advantage is there to opening cases?
784595,the point is that op has no friends
784682,i can't wait to use my alienware with 4gb of ram!
784728,tf2 has had even worse updates... could this mean tf3?
784789,because we all need aotc as a measure of our raiding skill.
784795,sounds like we have a clg fan here...
784811,yea he's only *pretending* to be retarded.
784903,great post op very original picture
784948,"oh shit, i'm silenced and can't do anything, better frantically spam right click on garen and hope for the best."
784994,because they finished ahead of lemondogs and everything
785169,"but guys, oat bee eff is such an awesome name..."
785173,cause no one ever wins an eco round
785195,yeah it's much better to keep hundreds of thousands of viewers waiting instead
785201,"oh well that changes everything, i'll go get my wallet."
785219,like australians call the spots.

786291,but i want all the enchantments to play the same!
786295,if only there was an extremely common convention to display sarcasm.
786318,yeah i'd rather they take 2 seconds out of their day to nerf the tec 9 into the ground without even considering any balance issues
786320,but then she wouldn't need to proc her passive!

787343,"yeah, just like you can with mf, another totally viable champion"
787382,but aren't you grateful to support your beloved e-sport athletes?
787449,as opposed to when you ban when you're last pick

787475,yes because lustboy is really bad
787485,sounds like something a fat clg bias person would say
787505,downvoted cuz i dont lyke ur veewmodle
787512,"nope, if riot has any bugs/exploits anywhere the only possible explanation must be because they're lazy and incompetent"
787521,i dunno man does it work as well as the mighty ezrael top?
787549,"hey, wq and r don't target and e is a skillshot!"

788136,"oh, one dlc marks what all dlc has to do"

788418,oh my gosh same planet obviously.
788435,"then they would have to show us our mmr, heaven forbid they do that"
788445,yeah because people have never blown flash for less/nothing.
788446,obviously a 10 second video clip is enough to prove that the cz is overpowered.
788453,there are too many french people that have to be called noob otherwise the 0/5 toplane can't show how hard he carrys.
788473,i can't wait for this to be pointed out another twenty times.
788497,yay more and easier ways for people to make shitty effortless art
788500,"yeah, riot's team sucks, never played a more cheaply done game, what are they ea?"
788521,clearly you are an idiot for enjoying something.
788524,but this will screw over my manamune riven
788536,"wow, it's almost like their not a international company with multiple offices and phonelines to those specific offices"
788554,"yea i agree, he is so weak with the new jungler items riot pls"

788631,riot does not care because aram is not the thing making them money
788642,"oh man, time for another hunger strike!"
788644,obviously kfc is too chicken to stand up to so-called gamers and their abusive behavior
788690,"yes, because enemy nexus towers are generally where one starts when they want to split."
788764,whoa what are you some kind of psychopath telling him to fuck off like that?
788773,you won't need that fps in a smoke because you can't see anyways!
788815,yeah this just made shaco lane super viable
788835,but...all cops are assholes who never do anything good!
788842,"well it only took them 10 months, better late than sorry!"
788847,i want to know what a shinny black table is.
788856,but that would tell the enemy that you are using karthus ult
788877,"yeah i don't even know why they didn't picked reginald for midlane, the guy won so many lans and shit."
788929,just water down the game even more you filthy casual.
788933,"yeah, i am still mad salty because rare released ki for the game boy in 1995, when my snes ki box clearly stated only for snes!"
788937,"no rockstar don't owe us anything, not even stuff they mentioned before launch that took over a year to implement idk why everyone is mad you're all whiny babies"
788944,"sure thing, and you mean to try and convince me that the office 365 team doesnt tell the xbox team when the next halo will launch?"
788950,"yeah, it's not like they got paid big $$$ for him"
788953,"guys he was obviously aiming at his teammate, but the 16 tick demo makes it look like he's shooting at the guy behind the wall"
788965,seems like saintvicious is a total noob in the jungle
788993,i usually cut myself that helps as well
789063,surely his 1 vote will override the other 4
789094,you saying grown men can't play with mega blocks and legos?
789200,that'll cost you a raid tier ...
789321,"yeah, they should just download that anti-ddos software, works every time."
789325,oh some dude said it on the internet without linking a source...it must be true then
789542,/thread this guy obviously knows everything about this topic
789872,"come on, there's no such thing..."
790055,"spamming the front page has always worked, right?"
790075,"of course this happens shes a fencer and as we all know, the trademark of being a fencer is going berserk as hell, ignoring consequences, using very little skill or timing and aoe."
790124,"yep, i hate myself so much, that as a direct result, i'm not great at a video game"
790138,because they're putting all their efforts in to developing east coast servers
790244,"i think we should just send a random team made of all the cool challenger reddit players, that's how we would win worlds"
790334,"no, it's obviously because he's referring to a literary work!"
790628,but **y**ou **o**nly **l**ove **o**celote right ?
791156,"yeah man, he probably didn't pay for that stuff in the past when things were better, he definitely bough it all as soon as he knew he was losing his house."
791229,"it doesnt matter, we all here at reddit are challenger, so we all get the challenger border."
791293,you're right; they should scrim 18 hours a day while they're over there...actually fuck that; sleep is for the weak; make it 24
791381,because they totally didn't get obliterated by njws
791458,"after watching clg's latest series, doublelift is most definitely the problem."
791585,i love it when people make statements about subjects they know nothing about.
791619,nah just vavle leaving pc for consoles
791692,nice spoiler tag you have there...
791694,i'm sure he only has one account
791822,i think we need to ask these hard-hitting questions at panels like this!
791841,because every class that doesn't have a short cd burst window is just faceroll
791877,if we're gonna go all out might as well just have world in honduras.
791895,"**who is this 4chan?, everyone is talking about him**"
792085,"but, but we should be thankful that we just got the tt permanently after 8+ months of the server being launched so stop asking for things!"
792189,pls also remove anivia's wall as i sometime get a troll or bad team mate who causes my death with it.
792254,"wow 10 less movementspeed, now he can't dodge anything"
792255,this is just to seperate the good nidalee's from the bad nidalee's
792376,wooosh robertxlee actually thinks that col has confirmed chaox to be adc.
792408,"yeah, who would post this shit?"
792432,but...but...consoles are so much better!
792459,can you guys stop working on splash arts and fucking fix the servers in na already.
792463,but... but... i might need those bullets!
792467,"oh, it's not so bad if you play with all the lights off at midnight, with 3 cats running around the house making suspicious noises."
792473,special thanks to crockid5 for letting me use his clip
792475,because we haven't made enough threads about it.
792480,oh thank god i was really worried we wouldn't be seeing kt hachani next season
792507,it's impossible to be sarcastic with text
792607,"oh yeah i mean it's so stupid and dumb, posting links to videos when most people would far rather just read a nice list."
792734,"i see you use flash in normal games, why?"
792766,a great feature for those of us with a bunch of leaver and hacker friends!
792770,ya i saw that chasing the cup too he must be a the most introverted fk ever why did clg even make him a shotcaller
792776,flame didnt impress me at all at worlds as well
792808,you'd just have to look at the old russia to see where our great society would've been if not motivated by money
792839,because waiting 20 seconds is just unacceptable.
792840,you mean you don't care that your friend played x game or took a screenshot?
792854,sure it totally changed how many fans they would have now even though its a long time ago with practically the whole roster changed completely
792887,yeah hey look i made it to silver iii in my placements i hope an lcs pro players could play with me
792947,your rigid interpretation of media is refreshing.
792954,"yeah because candy and jesiz really were the starplayers of sk, amiright?"
792972,~~swain steps = t + 5~~ swain steps = 6t l2math shitlord
793070,"yep, no matter how well explained a coincidence is, ea is always evil"
793103,it should not be on the frontpage because i do not like it and everyones opinion is worth less than mine because i am the greatest.
793200,"victorious lucian, to bury his corpse when the pbe changes go through /circle jerk"
793276,number 3 was definitely the best!
793280,"free to play, yes, but you can pay to win by having near invisible spells!"
793329,you should try a 360 controller so you can be a leet 420 quickscoper.
793370,"yeah, but i love how they've spiced up the new sets with orange and seafoam green."
793415,yea i bet you could be world first heroic raider or rank 1 gladiator without any effort
793428,because they're totally not right now.
793438,noob support didnt ult katarina.
793490,yeah cause buying tiamat on a ranged champ is not troll at all
793500,it's good that you're asking us
793556,but according to reddit you don't see this kind of thing in other professional sports
793571,i also like how they cut a ball the length of the table into the corner pocket.
793577,kat support is viable because you get free wards for ward jumping with ss
793608,"yeah not always true, but real smurfs most often don't go around blabbing about how their main account is challenger and that they need mid to win the game."
793628,"man turtle sucks right like he cant get used to a new support that speaks iffy english in 2 weeks, what a shiter"
793641,"4, those champions are never played anyway."
793703,"i can do that, fuck, everyone on reddit can do that"
793725,can't believe you didn't buy the simple plan album too.
793737,when ur own shadow laughs at you...u know its time to uninstall
793764,its because it was your fault ...duh...
793796,"yeah, thanking riot for how hard they work is a bunch of bullshit."
793804,"it's more cinematic, i don't understand why you guys are complaining."
793820,"yes, because not releasing a player will be added to your roster and jumping off a bridge are the same thing."
793851,i only want that cinematic feel
793854,i'm not satisfied until his base movement speed at level 6 is 0.
793941,"as a fellow challennger support main who always plays flawlessly and never make mistakes, i can confirm."
793955,"it feels great on xbox one as well, obviously it was sony."
793993,it's not like the exact same video is on the front page
794013,going to from a good paying job to nip has worked out so well for so many players
794020,but this subreddit would have nothing to discuss if there weren't coaches/players/analysts calling out other coaches/players/analysts.
794030,i do so love the smell of propaganda in the morning.
794050,so just remember to pick a champion?
794069,"yes, because pc's totally degrade in that period of time while the consoles just get better."
794095,"yeah, i'm sure op's friend is unemployed and is getting more tattoos while frantically looking for a front desk job at a business building for finer people."
794133,because i'll post that on the internet.
794163,yeah... i am 100% sure frog1ven has the teamplay skills that altec lacks...
794181,"yes, feed his ego some more, it's definitely what he needs right now."
794183,"well if they finished top 8 at worlds and now struggled to finish 5th are regionals, maybe it's time to bring voidle back?"
794197,"all i know is, riot is never about money so they must have our good playing experience in mind when they choose to make decisions like that"
794204,thats why based riot gave me my one minute yellow trinket!
794205,at least its not from twitter..
794233,oh so now black people are the only race?
794316,it's all a ploy to distract you all from the real conspiracy they both neutered performance on pc so people would buy into consoles!
794318,"if you curious, this is skyrim for ps4."
794319,"pc gamers is not a gamers, duh."
794330,"i dunno, ask akali and katarina's q and w/e"
794402,"yeah, because the only way one can be toxic is through chatting."
794463,"ah yes dota 2, the hidden gem on steam..."
794472,i'm not working again until regional wage disparity stops!
794541,if only nintendo set up a server farm so you'd upload the replay file and then nintendo would have their servers render it out and upload it at 4k.
794554,obviously just being nice to your friends and being a dick to everyone else still make you a nice person.
794562,riot should tottaly hire you to do their balancing.
794569,"ye, that will solve everything."
794570,"oh yeah, because the leavers will think, mhh i get -100 ip, maybe i shouldn't leave."
794629,"toootally worth it, best james bond movie ever"
794703,i was worried there would not be any zombie games announced.
794714,but they both have guns and you can shoot stuff from a 1st person perspective so obviously they are the same.
794729,that sounds completely neutral and unbiased.
794760,nah man... it's suposed to be the jungler to kill the blue buff for me.
794765,"wow, you don't come across as incredibly intolerant at all."
794767,"yeah, these b5-dia1 duos were definitely a problem."
794791,"yeay another 2d platformer, yesss"
794829,"yeah, i'm so glad they introduced team builder in ranked!"
794849,ya... wouldn't want to upset the disc users.
794895,dae riot literally the worst company and they should just quit and just give up and let ogn run it all cause korea master race over all
794906,yea i lost to this and on purple side therefore its the blueside advantage and thresh bug making me lose the game
794914,"yeah, it's way more fun playing against thresh or morgana every single game."
795026,"no, you don't get it... he's good late game now because attack speed"
795049,because only having one big hit box instead of a dynamic robot that brakes apart as it takes damage is way better.
795057,would definitely make the community less toxic.
795058,write a bot that buys keys for mistake prices.
795117,"but if there aren't shadows for my shadow, and my skin doesn't reflect off of a spotlight or brick houses then how is it like real life?"
795165,"skinny jeans make you look like a hipster assclown instead, that's sooo much better"
795183,"yeah, because grunge rock is the epitome of mature taste in music."
795225,such a great response thanks for the help.
795243,"thank you for the anecdotal evidence that contributes extremely to the discussion on heimerdinger's balance, from an annie main no less."

795408,valid opinion not welcome in league community
795460,"thats impressive for ilvl 270, i would like to see what kind of numbers ilvl 500+ can put out"
795462,wow i never thought of it that way ok everything i said is irrelevant and forgiv1n is clearly evil
795487,"just 700 ping and d/c's every 5 seconds, totally playable"
795555,i can't wait for lmq to represent na at worlds!
795581,i would trade it all for that one chance to try my hand at installing gtav...
795643,yea because plat players are actually good
795655,"no, sarcasm is nonexistent online unless you conclude with (just joking lol)"

799739,"whoa, that's a lot of damage, it must be nerfed imo."

801045,well we all became experts on reginald's behavior after the 5 minute clip of him and dyrus.
801071,how dare the casters make the cast more noob friendly when they are being broadcasted on public tv where 50% of the viewers have never seen competitive cs before.
801079,"actually i would really like to see kill streaks, we need a tactical nuke and lots of really expensive skins i can buy with my dad's credit card"

801230,"yeah, because rengar is working wonders in lcs."
801235,yeah cus removing xd from supa hot crew totally made that name professional

801620,"ye, look what amazing new na talents get picked up for the old guys... bjergsen, amazing and so on, na is truly a great region to pick up new guys."
801644,goku has his own super saiyan god form ;)

801770,"yeah you have to be ap to go to mid, i forgot."
801823,wow na challenger scene is looking really strong this split!
801847,"wow, you described what the survey was about so well.."

802103,"thanks for brining this to my attention op, i have never ever seen this before."
802108,it's almost as if it isn't a finished project
802109,"well, since we're so close to the end of life for the ps4 we can safely say there is no chance it'll happen."
802128,"yep, that's exactly why your post was so shit."
802131,sorry my sarcasm doesnt get to you...
802151,don't need wards because you have traps
802194,"sorry i don't play 13,000 valve deathmatches a day."
802206,dae intros were only good in le 90s?
802235,it definately has nothing to do with the us having only 6.5x the population but 98x the land mass.
802261,"if you lose a 4v5, combine all the lost lp and make the leaver lose it all!"
802264,"yep, because you just have to flame to get reported."
802272,"dude he is challenger, he can't do that at all..."
802290,riot should take away the timer on wards so people have to memorize when they were placed.
802474,"yeah, because you see thinks like that at lcs everyday right?"
802512,"stop staring at her butt, she's not a piece of meat!"
802520,classic supports like soraka are so fun to play as and against
802574,"i'll give ya $5 for that garbage, take it or leave it."

802707,"not true, sivir has a special taunt with cassiopeia and therefore interacts with her."
802727,yeah man starcraft 2's game editors are complete shit
802761,"because people on reddit always have intelligent, serious discussions"
802776,"oh boy, this sure is a game breaker."

802848,wow... it's like the first time i ever read that about a champion that is hot (hype/trendy)
802906,yes because only those 3 champions can dive and kill you.
802926,yeah that ps4 emulator should be here any day.
802948,"noob thresh doesn't have teleport, couldn't b and baron at the same time"
802982,"yep, and only south american tribes have them"

803372,naw man the kit is broken we need to totally rework him numbers aren't enough
803404,"i know right, what an idiot for explaining it to non europeans."
803464,"yeah, just knowing that this game exists makes me enjoy the plethora of other games on the 3ds less."
803466,but mayweather would just bob and weave for an hour
803475,just take smite as midlaner so you can smite the blue buff.
803479,i thought everyone read through the quest text thoroughly in every game and ranked them all in a notepad sheet.
803492,"ms should buy naughty dog, nintendo, and sony."
803498,"yeah, that's an awesome argument to get them to implement it."
803528,i swear mf is as broken as yasuo
803586,once tabezz retired he sworn he'd never had another support again.
803592,yeah that totally would have fit the wizard of oz theme.
803601,now all we need to do is scale each box art so that it shows the resolution the game is at and we'll have an even better comparison
803615,"they need to make a mode where the bosses have only 1 hp, and you get 5 chances of loot, but even that might be too difficult for about half of wow's subscribers"
803628,im 8 bt i m vry mashur 4 ma age and rlly smrt
803692,"yeah totally, only 1 ability scales with ap and totally unintentional..."
803701,no wonder duck dynasty did so poorly
803704,what does che guevara got to do with gaming?
803709,this is the type of content that ruins subs!
803726,yup admiral taylor's storyline sure was great
803733,"it's your problem, you have to fix it"
803779,yeah this is a real waste of recourses!
803789,i'd much rather have features that are not finished but in exchange riot would stick to all their etas.
803819,nice now all the guys that got caught in the latest vac wave can restock.
803833,but they are unfun and last too long with no couterplay...
804135,it's because steam is perfect and never has any issues.
804228,"yep, and you should probably be locked up for life or given the death sentence for doing such an immoral and horrible thing."
804590,yeah that release was so successful
804702,"no, you'd keep him to carry you to silver 2"
804721,"thanks to op, no yasuo player will ever make this mistake again"
804775,yea xd that 20-30 less ping is the difference between silver and challenger
805180,"better don't give them reason to say: we did poorly at worlds, because our coach was doing ama instead of practicing"
805229,the fact that you're not a lol fan added a lot to the submission...
805403,"aye, i'm sure they knew for certain that gleeb was a bipolar headcase when they signed him"
805425,they just need to make vertical monitors.
805579,indie games are usually smaller than retail games.
805750,a character without voice lines would be nice and relaxing.
805751,morgana's auto-attacks scale with ad.
805771,"but talon with 2 damage items has a cho'gath ult on his q, basically"
805781,"yeah, they should have put some drm into minecraft's server to be able to just shutdown everything."
805905,they thought they could win game 3 so they cheated
805906,"well we have video footage of ray punching a woman, therefore, it is infinitely worse than any other crime by any player in the nfl."
805924,"well, cho'gath has an indicator on when feast will kill the enemy but kinda makes sense because of the stacks.. on the other hand veigar gains 5 ap when he kills an enemy so..."
805975,this was definitely post worthy.
806056,"damn, there goes your 15 minutes of fame."
806095,"actually dude, i think you are confusing both of those with the irish potato famine, that's the only time people have ever starved so you much be confused."

806354,you obviously haven't played the soul stealing soul stacking thresh before
806375,hey man give him another season he will totally be a totally different space now.
806392,"indeed, soloq has taught us that the best way to get back at your team for being bad is complaining about them in a tweet!"
806450,i prefer just calling them casuals with a sneer.
806537,yet another quality post on the front page of r/gaming...
806538,good advertisement for andre's steam group though...
806560,great contribution to the discussion.
806717,let's weaponize video games for brainwashing.
806753,"next, they should implement a system that if you win lane, but lose game, you don't lose lp"
806863,ive won a game as sivir going 27/4 in a 4v5 ranked so obvs its not an issue get good scrubs
806870,why bother wasting flash when you can just predict their flash and save yours to suicide into ~~tsm~~ the enemy team later?
806889,because indie games are just completely fucking terrible.
806892,because season 2 is so relevant to a team considering picking him up today
806985,meanwhile phreak is the epitome of in depth analysis
806987,"bro obviously link is a noob for not dodging the spear, wtf bench him"
807005,"i'm sure only one korean team would come over, and not more."

807352,"of course they do, they enjoy what they're told to enjoy!"
807361,"well they never released halo 3 for pc ... or halo 4 ... or halo reach ... or halo 3: odst, so i'm sure this is right around the corner!"
807376,"yeah, you definitely got loads of 'value' off of having that skin all those games."
807377,"right, thank you very much for actually responding to the points i made, instead of just throwing out an insulting assertion."
807378,yeah its only limited to bronze...
807381,if only this was available at the beginning of the season my team surely would have been better than 0-6
807403,not playing every champ on challenger lvl should get you reported in ranked.
807423,i'm looking forward to how many mass-murders it causes.
807448,maybe the dude is just trying to get some money for a mouse
807501,they will listen to you and do what you want.
807610,but his ult is a global shield that changes teamfights often enough to matter
807624,as a white man my rights are constantly opressed amirite?
807650,1fps is amazing since it gives you the opportunity to take in each single frame.
807671,na it needs to be dubbed by 4kids because we know how great they are
807764,"if it's new, it's too complicated for me."
807853,unless you have a wii u. because we don't want freedom cry.
807910,"so uh, you should totally trade that to me real quick, so... ya know, i can appraise it, and pay you appropriately?"
807920,wow i can't imagine why mojang wouldn't use their magic game improving powers to make it better.
807938,"because riot is evil and only has the intention of ruining the game, what did you think?"
807983,take the easy route and just change your country :p
807990,"yes, because this one video will be the lasting memory for all leaguers on what darien was known for"
807993,gotta use blue trinket for that global arrow
808021,yeah cause i'm just going to let you surround my cities with your entire military force without any question
808033,"nope just, you no one ever does this, just you."
808042,"right, because brazil was the worst team in this tournament"
808088,so like a dozen people hopped on the dig fan train after coast?
808105,but back then you could see the difference from the good typer to the great typer.
808110,"nah man, just proc her passive on every one of them."
808111,"yes, i'd love to see the jarjar binks of the zelda world become a playable character."
808184,they'll wait to change his skills for his rework in the future.
808224,"yeah, because dota comments *never* get up voted here."
808231,"you're right, i think teams should just keep mediocre players and set super low goals such as try to not get relegated."
808259,guys they only did this because ms announced theirs.
808322,dude it was panda express and it happened twice get your facts straight
808343,who are you to decide who someone loves
808418,"yeah dishonered, hitman absolution and halo 3 are all underwhelming shit games."
808431,"whoa 545k in phase 1, wow such a good player"
808448,"yeah, who could *possibly* watch these teenagers clicking away playing videogames all night?"
808474,yeah they really had developed him into a dynamic character so you cared when he died.
808500,you have one option: coach other people me for example
808502,"yes, and no one will ever see the visual representation of the quality of your graphics card"
808554,botlane seems like its soo far away y'know so i get lazy.
808558,"well this discussion will go over well, and i'm sure all will be civil."
808587,playing the game the way it's meant to be played.
808627,"well boy, am i glad i bought the disc edition of journey, flower, and flow!"
808647,"well if you don't want that gift, i'll get it then!"
808656,human eye can't see more than 25 fps.
808661,goldeneye 64 is way better than cod in every way...
808669,i would ask you questions but you are chat restricted so you wouldn't be able to answer
808685,where do you think they get all those 1 or 2 rp that they give to random players who ask for it?
808691,only one more day until my main isn't chat restricted oh i didn't know chat restriction dissapeared after a few days
808741,this video is so full of league of legends content that i can barely restrain myself.
808786,cause clg was doing so well before montecristo and montecristo knowd nothing about league of legends.
808789,"yeah, so much trash talk going on in this thread right?"
808808,"sorry to be the one to break the news to you, but i think your pc may be a console."
808828,everyone knows if you say something on stream that's the truth.
808834,"props to him for speaking english, he really improved in that one"
808864,"yes, but when a major network like bbc makes a report with one rhetorical line all of reddit has to kick and scream."
808883,its because its bm to use that laugh function that is provided to you by the game.
808906,i never said anything negative about alliance... you can fanboy as much as you want but shitting on others' opinions is pretty cool
808925,"but, but, but, i want to play that specific lane and champ and someone else may take it"
808933,na getting ddosed because there is literally no way to protect yourself from it.
809011,"yeah, scarra wasn't an impressive player because i could get the same kda in bronze."
809025,damn i bet tsm is 2nd guessing their choice now that you have voiced your opinion on their new players name good insight
809043,i guess 3-4 is nothing and easy to get.
809125,"don't be silly, lol is for filthy casuals who don't know how to deny cs ^"
809158,"woah the ps4 gets 900p and 30 fps, almost 4k right there."

809482,pink gold peach might want to lay off the feasts...
809512,swoop is op they need to fix that shit
809570,"maybe you should just stick to kaz profile pics and banderas gifs, those were surely not annoying"
809643,because people are jealous over someone making porn videos using minecraft animations and introducing children to bad habbits.
809670,yeah because laughing at stupidity is totally collaboration
809671,"hey i just bought the game, spoilers tags please!"
809674,yeah broken hitboxes and shit sound are subjective
809679,i wouldnt go tiamat and hydra...
809687,"sorry, apparently you need this:"
809688,looks like microsoft are really listening to the feedback about lowering digital pricing.
809696,"you are right timobouwerz, words are always more important than actions."
809722,b-b-but... it's going to let the commies win!
809725,"it's the what...oh, okay animation."
809749,i have no idea what you are talking about that is completely original.
809755,you're not allowed to be impressed because games that have iaps are literally satan
809860,hmm... i wonder where you're from
809862,he should just fill with abilities names
809864,if that's what you're trying to do to your boat... no wonder nothing is working...
809924,because hidden math is the most accurate.
810026,nope there's no gay people so the creators are homophobic bigots
810049,how else is the little puke gonna learn his lesson
810066,at least we can watch pobelter and co provide us with high quality entertainment...
810092,your parents were subtly hinting when you were younger.
810130,it's almost as if your armor vest is useless!
810143,"oh man, you definitely caught me."
810150,"you see, those are clearly labelled and minors do not have access to them, whereas video games are *clearly* for kids."
810181,"you can't have joke threads, all of reddit is a serious discussion"
810334,too bad that cho doesnt have a silence which would render elise useless and the 3 tsm players were not knowing what theyre supposed to do.
810366,that would just make the game easier and it'd be unfair to the people that dedicated so much time to learning to scroll through chat for timers.
810380,"oh gee, thanks, i hadn't thought about that in the slightest during that time."
810405,"yes, because the entire xbox team completely **forgot** about the screencap feature."
810413,"yes, because there are loads of games that look graphically better than mk8."
810424,because i can hear your tone as well as i can see your face over the internet.
810427,"you should never stop playing after 3~4 loses in a row, the next one is a free win"
810502,but you could always say you experienced one of the best games in history...
810505,"no, its a middle schooler who did this."
810538,"you're right, plus every single copy of the original game in existence is destroyed when a remake is created so we don't want to run the risk of having a new game ruin the old one for everyone else"
810571,and their fur bikinis are great for keeping warm in skyrim.
810598,wow i've never seen this one before
810604,can see why it took over a year to make it.
810638,this must be a ripoff of the game because it clearly doesn't say candy crush saga on it.
810674,oh i bet king will see this and make everything free.
810703,naw it's funny when a tsm member or doublelift trash-talk.
810717,"i've only seen it on this sub-reddit 10 times in the last few days, no one at all is talking about it though."
810767,"nope, obviously ea is just the devil and hitler's son."
810773,because vanilla = only survival.
810858,unless it's valve everything they do is perfect and nobody can do any better
810867,this is from i'm a gayfish at the end of the simpsons episode about fish sticks!
810911,"yes, they must have used the colors that take less space to store."
810913,"transmogs posts are not allowed, please remove that post with 800 upvotes"
810929,cape physics was at the top of the priority list dont'cha know?
810963,when did mojang add that mob in?
811009,because junglers have so little influence on top lane.
811035,"no, i will not deal with filthy casuals!"
811048,"of course it is, microsoft is perfect and not to blame for crap performance on their more expensive and lower hardware system."
811052,"finally, some good news for you americans as opposed to the usual announcements that features will be postponed in america."
811071,were destructible environments invented before the 1940s though?
811110,"yeah, defo carried against reason"
811127,"bro, let's stay neutral, how about you change your title to non european instead of american."
811151,well i mean i would and all but what about the sweet bonus content?
811194,you mean how the game was regularly?
811199,"yeah fucking virgins, only reason they are better is because they r ugly virgins who dont have a life."
811217,a larger player base is definitely a huge negative for the community
811425,bad... now he will become a sexual deviant and never know the touch of a woman...
811601,"if he doesn't, he's not breaking the tos, so blizzard isn't allowed to ban him."
811602,"you're a horrible person, doing that is worse than murdering someone, you deserve to not only be perma banned but thrown in jail too."
811893,obviously in real life you nasty idiot!
811899,well there is no atari 2600 version so it is exclusive of that console system.
812202,"like other people say, theirs works, so your issue is bullshit."
812292,but winning 4 in a row after being 0-3 in a bo7.
812526,"you are a nice person, sure you go everyday to church, good job guy!"
812614,rito worried that even the best western adc might feed if placed in high elo in korea
812917,dota 2 invented dynamic loading screens and the option to disable them
812976,cause gleeb is totally as good as aphromoo right?
813005,give my account details to an unknown person on the internet... seems safe
813049,"yeah look how super sexualised tristana, lulu and kayle are."
813071,that makes it sounds like they're the same...
813131,me and dyrus are quitting around the same time bc we luv each other so much &lt;3
813165,i see you share my passion for seeing wickd being destroyed in lane
813224,"yeah, zuna forced the team into all of the roleswaps zuna was the one and only voice in that team"
813225,"locodoco, always classy, never salty"
813256,absolutely there's nothing social about local multi-player at all.
813263,"yeah, that isn't stupid at all..."
813387,its k though cos there onli young cant just expect kidz to not be azzholes.
813434,yea fuck peoples opinions for not liking what you like they are just haters and trenders.
813436,"i know right they should pick up me instead, i got a huge champ pool"
813460,"yeah, let's just stop supporting teams that can't win against koreans, fuck these scrubs in the lcs."
813461,"yeah, so god damn disappointed in shrc, only second place at world finals while not even speaking the same language..."
813594,maybe your fps shouldn't be dressed so provocatively.
813712,17'' 1280x1024 monitor with 75hz... i play at 800x600 best monitor ever...
813773,oh wow monte and thoorin totally trash-talked tsm so much this episode
813861,obviously you should start seeing black and white.
813862,so basically the game only begins once the credits roll?
813980,i guess i need to get glasses cause i didn't see any spoilers in the title.
814003,"yeah totally forgot, avenged sevenfold is metal now days"
814101,"i know rite, playing on lan is so overrated because you basically play online anyway."
814112,yes because 27+ million people (monthly) are all broke potheads; there can't be *any* diversity.
814130,good quality post cya on the prontpage
814154,..i don't understand why you 3d printed a bunch of save icons.
814315,yea 32 hours of gaming for $60 is a total ripoff.
814403,"so, someone clarify something for me: they're trying to fix the packet loss that's been occurring since 4.17 went live, and saying ha, whatever, sucks to suck for 75% of the na player base by not moving the servers to a more centralized location, even though the community is screaming for ping fixes since season 3... yep, rito definitely has their shit together."
814413,omfg scrub reported not owning all champions go back to bronze
814422,hardly... give me some sources!
814458,"well, if you ask cheapest, it involves a wooden sword..."
814505,"i just wish we lived in the world where some studio would make it into a movie, i bet it would make a billion dollars"
814515,its probably because plat is full of toxic idiots
814520,"no you didn't,clearly the bot did,as he got the kills."
814587,don't forget that flash resets autos.
814640,you gotta be diamond first then it's okay apparently
814643,"i'm going to act like its not a big deal, but when a game comes out with 1080p/60fps, i'm going to post about how awesome it is!"
814742,"aye, just like seraph proved that every korean coming to na will be doomed to fail"
814825,well valor doesn't exist anymore so you're wrong
814829,yeah usually parents here educate their kids to be mean to other people.
814930,its the internet and its reddit how is he anyone suppose to be 100% sure its
815061,everyone on reddit apparently has never been reported or chat restricted you guys are all saints
815104,"as a gamer i'm terrified of change, ea understand me so well."
815141,"fake, my eardrums aren't bleeding from the victory cries"
815159,"what a surprise, that's the first time sunfire cape received new visuals this year"
815160,"hey look, riot put in the up side of the screen what the minimap already tells you, when a camp respawned, such a bad move by riot, making an existing thing only clearer"
815192,"no, it's not his fault that it always happens to be his teammates and his team that is losing."
815266,but i need to save money by using warding totem so i don't have to buy wards at all
815279,"no you dumbass, everyone knows immigrants cause cancer"
815294,yeah create anew ip to compete against a cross platform because the dev made areal with sony about the beta and some dlc content.s is really threatened here to lose a part of their user to the ps4!
815305,"what a thoughtful comment, it sure adds a lot to the discussion!"
815367,"yeah, thank god they were snatched up by activision instead of ea."
815380,yeah but valve official decided that nobody plays de_train anymore so nobody is going to mind it
815410,"oh...but i thought riot added white noise to the headset, so that should fix anything"
815447,"bro, official policy is that you to have to have at least 2,000 days played"
815448,will bob make a guest appearance again?
815455,"indeed, it takes a lot of courage to make fun of someone over the internet."
815467,"damn man, your life must have been rough if this is the first thing to ever make you laugh."
815494,"the human eye cant see over 30fps, and 30ps is just so much more cinematic!"
815510,"against cw, that must of taken alot of work"
815576,nah dude he has a friend who works at riot so he is not worried about bans.
815588,"yeah, because overheating is a huge issue with the ps4, and was of very limited concern with the ps3."
815595,"well, you know, we have a weekly call to see how i feel about their services and ask if there's anything they can do for me."
815626,riot should totally hire you to search for casting talents!
815633,more like u can't escape out of elo hell
815658,i don't have to play a game to know it sucks!
815672,the real question is whether she paid for all the food on her own or not.
815699,they obviously meant a fraction of 100%
815756,"hey, i have logged in and enterred my credit card numbers but i don't have the rps"
815764,"give it to gnar, he seems to need it"
815844,"just tell your team to ward more, that'll work!"
815872,long time to wait for a port...
815901,best console mod i've seen in a while.
815918,"don't question the reddit hive mind, you should know by now no one is capable of improving their level of play"
815939,"nah, nothing at all creepy about impromptu, unauthorized, amateur brain surgery... :p"
815943,that is a great reason for them to get shit on
815951,"now i can play my league games before i play my league games, and know which feeding piece of shit to start yelling at in champ select before the game even starts!"
815969,"yeah, ea will be hard pressed to find so much shit like mobile game ports and unfinished ripoff kickstarter games to put on origin"
815981,"murica' ain't fucked up, we just got character"
815998,"i trust olly, because he's been such an upstanding guy in the past."
816000,"no way, it goes to your steam pocket."
816014,i bet qt is really hurt at thorin's harsh words
816020,ooh i can't wait for them to only pay attention to the pc version too!
816028,its not a crime to be handicapped!
816056,"and we should add the ability for the game to delete system32 if you play it, too, because if you don't like that, you can just leave!"
816070,"it's so the photons reach his eyes faster than anyone elses, so he can react much faster."
816079,welll technically it requires an xbox one video game system so that brings the cost to ~$580 after taxes.
816117,it's because ati is the masterrace
816119,"tssk, even zoe quinn has standards."
816157,mash x until you get to the credits
816166,he must be really op since he gets so much play time in the lcs
816170,"because better numbers = better performance, right guys?"
816177,"yeah, they should have tested it on pbe first."
816188,well youtube is for serious people and intelligent discussions.
816192,but resolution and fps is just a number!
816193,he was cheating at lan in a grand finals and realized that he was being blatant so he tried to play it off by not shooting and making it look like something was wrong with his game.
816225,if only riot gave out fresh level 30 accounts for everyone who wants to smurf
816230,gold in korea is challenger in na!
816256,because champions balance depends only on their own numbers and not items and other champions
816266,"hey, not everyone has the *luxury* of playing with sound"
816284,okay then let's not bring this to their attention then.
816289,this is the best idea i've ever heard.
816295,if i had korean ping i would make these plays every game.
816310,"welcome to reddit, great first post."
816408,yea because the rest of m5 are clearly overrated and don't deserve praise ...
816416,"well violent games are obviously the problem, how could abusive parents make a kid angry enough to kill?"
816543,i have a pc with 2 780 tis but i prefer my xbone because the 30 fps and 720p has a more cinematic feel
816552,"yes, very stupid for giving people options."
816558,"he means peak of the scoreboard, as in top fragger."
816576,"the real question is, is it 1080p 60fps?"
816611,"stupid humans, should have used more than one spartan ii!"
816704,but i thought it didn't matter since it depends on your tv?
816739,but we were told that there was no downside to digital only consoles!
816744,you just summed up all of reddit.
816833,"he was 4-2, this isn't an outplay, he's just fed."
816851,my best required text was inferno by dante
816878,yeah he is a god at dodging those spears.
816880,"yeah, just like players always know the rules better than referees."
816926,"he's better looking than us, of course he must be some asshole"
816929,"yup, and dual-wielding spinning axes that you throw, which then bounce off the target high into the air so you can catch them and throw them again was also a terrible idea because it wasn't practicle in the real world..."
816967,cause in other games nobody will call him just master
816993,"remember x1 still have t3h cloudtm and tiled resources, it will close the gap."
817002,"wow, i have *never* heard **that** joke before."
817018,i'm sure she read this and will tone it down.
817115,"i've been waiting for it for years, but i don't think it will ever be released."
817204,i've been swayed by your remarkable argument and have decided that eso is the greatest game ever!
817243,to be fair that poorly advised dive was a plot by zuna to throw the game!
817245,because it excludes the other people that don't share your nationality god
817263,since 10% of reddit is challenger this is the biggest opportunity for them out there.
817269,"yes, and csgolounge is evil too, because you can go gamble on the skins you gambled to get"
817364,how dare you say you aren't comfortable with potentially illegitimate votes!
817382,"yeah because we are using mother teresa as a literal example, not a metaphoric one."
817471,"yeah it is, we're all challenger"
817475,yes this video really shows that wickd is a bad sport.
817536,that couldn't at all be a joke.
817565,obligatory we did it reddit!!
817592,"wow that was terrible, none of those vehicles got damaged at all."
817593,but it works out in the long run if you deserve it!
817594,but my anecdotal evidence trumps yours because i matter and you don't!
817628,clearly you have the greatest taste ever and everyone who disagrees is an idiot.
817639,being a giant walking damage soaking oracle holder was so much fun as jungle
817645,"best movie, citizen kane could learn a thing or two."
817694,"nonono dude, you don't get his point, we **need** replays."
817722,leona can't play a ranged ad carry.
817731,mr 'iwillfaptothisnow' is indeed the smartest man i know.
817738,since his playstyle fits so perfect to clg
817752,i'm glad you told me because i wouldn't have known.
817784,"well, that's a great reason to marry someone."
817836,"while we are at it, let's also remove reddit from the internet because of sub-reddits like beating women"
817890,"okay after further examination of what op said, i think he made his son do that because he had a video of him and his son playing games together, oh my god that's amazing op."
817946,just snap on part of another belt.
817973,"not only is it a feature, it is a pc exclusive - yay!"
817985,that one console that is obviously better than the other for reasons obvious only to me because i am the voice of the majority
818033,not if you have a sexy battle-scarred groundwater skin like i do.
818040,"yea, because that really matters."
818044,that's why the tribunal only does a bit of it while the rioters do most of it
818071,it is in the shape of a trident you pervert!
818112,yes because we all know the most popular games are the best games
818146,those quotation marks are hard to use!
818160,"well you see by removing any difficulty or decision making in yasuo's engage, riot buffed the quality of yasuo's life."
818170,dammit now i'm sad thanks a lot dude.
818180,"fuck you, and fuck your opinions."
818221,that seems like it wouldn't be a very good decision.
818228,"yes, because every single game that's been pushed back for one reason or another has turned out *better* because of it."
818233,why would we want to fix it when we can just keep coming out with new skins?
818242,"nope, splash art team still working on nid's splash arts."
818286,yeah that 0.1 ap ratio change...80 less damage late game so impactful
818316,"ya, cause gamestop is probably the only place you can buy video games and game systems..."
818329,ok then you should check some assorted settings
818389,"i know how you feel, my teammates are always dragging me down too."
818427,"i bet the worker who took the return was a pc-elitist and thought to themself, yup, a bunch of rocks, checks out."
818451,"yep, since bugs never happen in lan-events"
818513,i'm gonna wait for deep down:ultimate personally
819269,sounds like you need to rush phantom dancer!
819540,i would have given the rookie to altec but whatever

820390,"yeah, i'm sure she's making bank out of all of those $1 donations that paypal takes 100% of (because of the low amount, paypal basically takes the full dollar) and the fact that her subscribe button was removed because of the fact that she trolls she's banking alright"
820458,that's because his ult makes a clone of himself so there are 2 shacos in case you were wondering
820479,"but 1 american counts for 8,371 persons from another nation."
820584,because buying a dual-core in 2014 is a great idea...

820945,"koreans praising the foreign team with the most koreans on it, what a surprise"

821014,that philippine team was pretty good...
821099,i didn't know illidan dropped a mount!
821135,and nasus is also bad because his q promotes farming.

821529,"what, you don't like 4 cents for a 6 month old game?"
821576,that's a good reason to dislike someone.
821622,i'm sure blizzard will do something about that for you.
821623,"okay you call him bud in one sentence and then you call him shit in the next, make your mind up."
821676,run cmd type in: dir viewmodel_config

822530,"oh yeah, didn't see the na one; bjergsen is half na doe"

822651,oh it'd be such a shame for toxic players to deal with people that act the same way as them.
822698,playing a game and snapping achievements is silly.
822725,"yep, because being realistic is what every fantasy game should strive to achieve."
822746,"they are trying to be nice, so that everyone can be finished by the time master chief collection comes out."
822759,"yeah, they announced it but i guess nobody thought to make a thread about it."
822777,"it must been fake, since you still have refunds left with lvl 30"
822784,"almost like they use the pbe for balance testing, wtf is up with that?"

822999,"we can't see thoorin's beautiful face 100% of the time, ruined my watching experience"
823024,"yeah i have 7 invincibles in my bags too and around 8-9 sha of anger mounts too in my alts, gotta love seeing these plebs being happy with their 1 mount am i right?"
823029,his ap ezreal was so creative and new though
823059,"i forgot, he said sorry so we were supposed to circlejerk about how much we love lmq and how cute they all are."
823095,"yeah, i love it when a game doesn't fill the entire tv screen."
823108,but 40 armor reduction is so bad.

823811,"yeah, let's throw his nationality in here, so relevant"
823857,but did you not see that official trailer on mass effect 4?
823865,"well, why dont you try playing support on a professional level, because you are so much better"
823872,try putting yourself in the left hand side column of the custom game.
823875,"yeah, your mistake right there was researching marijuana first."
823876,"but that would makes things way to convenient, cool and interesting things should be hard to find so no one steals his karma!"
823925,if (option.unlockedfps == true) { framerate.unlocked = true; } else { framerate.unlocked = false; } //
823926,yeah because the eu games are always so exciting.
824010,wildturtle cause hes goofy as fuck

824029,"we need cd timers next, riot you gotta stay consistent with your game design"
824032,braum is totally a ripoff of the norn!
824050,his i'm right because i'm annoying enough to be acknowledged by the organization that i leaked information about argument is so solid though
824078,but the human eye can't see more than 30 frames per second thats why tv shows are only recorded at 24 frames per second.

824355,"you want to buy me rp because i want more teemo skins, convinced, cheers"
824366,"alliance, their mid laner is just awful"

825252,cod was totally the first game to have player created logos.
825279,"but dude, it's over $4000, how could it not be good?"
825299,they will probably never get a replacement unit.
825336,when you have an a in geometry you can ult twice.
825867,when is the last time eu done anything to deserve positivity?
826173,look at this patriarchal shitlord oppressing me

827338,"yeah, the mojang devs all look 12 to me"
827353,was a $25 cheat included on the purchase of the steelseries elite?
827365,make sure to make all of these separate apps because everyone i've heard talking about facebook messenger is that they are very happy to have two facebook apps so even more than that would be even better.
827378,they did a great job on the analyst desk and their english has really improved
827397,"wow clg winning the 3rd best challenger team, they are so good"
827567,"oh my apologies, i didn't know drinking rum was one of those nasty habits of a dirty basement dweller."

827935,dude that's why dota is better they had so.many champs picked in ti4
827941,its better to ban zilean who's so op and way better than any other support in this game.
827972,yeah because dota games are all 2 hours
828015,koreans have won every single ogn this season.
828123,riot caters to the community so they're allowed to have an excuse for nothing having either a replay system or a dota-like afk system after 5 years.
828201,yeah because currently people use garen and cho gath to counter ryze right?
828235,"dude, this post has let's play in it's title... downvoted"
828300,"this was never suggested, keep it up!"
828432,isn't it obvious to everybody that turret shots disappear once you get out of turret range?

828521,"yes, why has noone ever thought of that?"
828536,"she is a girl interacting with her fans, obviously thats wrong"
828548,this is the most original game mode idea that has ever been posted.
828656,just check what your favourite pro player is forced to use by his sponsors and you can be just as good.
828700,that's my trigger you shitlord.
828704,this is why i don't rank very high in any game whatsoever.
828744,"if skt won 1 million dollars, shouldn't fnatic?"
828757,it's only cinematic if it's capped at 30fps.
828769,i had the same question about mundo
828773,"does it lock frame rate at 30 fps, because that's really the best way to make a game look cinematic."
828786,but shooters started on consoles!
828818,the reward is the experience itself.
828819,it means they are going to charge you extra for the day 1 dlc.
828835,yep anything is better than the permanent eye damage of 720p!
828838,because they were beautiful before the patch
828848,ikr doublelift and clg are so good they kicked curse to fight for a relegation spot and 3-0'd lmq.
828869,"yea great, only 2 more years to wait"

829091,"yeah, and with next update, it might even use your cpu"
829119,so if riot would ban all the noobs we didnt have toxicity

829150,"those fucking gays and their fishing, i tell ya h-wut."
829212,they say that to make the other countries feel useful
829213,"just what i wanted, another set with spikes and horns on it."

829300,yea i stopped watching the broncos cause john elway retired
829301,ikr i cant wait to see who plays the seattle seahawks in the next superbowl
829309,"valve, come on... it's like you're not even trying... i'm not playing until they patch this."
829340,maybe you should stop dying so much.
829470,but... but our eyes can't see over 30 fps...
829488,"that can't be true, every one knows the only people with ping problems are everyone on east coast"
829507,where does that stand in relation to your mom?
829522,high priority issue right here..
829537,girls don't play vidja games you nerd virgin.
829587,surely you can leave a game if you only destroy it for 4 other players instead of 9.
829592,"it was a joke since the guy said body shot and not anywhere else, should have put a"
829607,looking at his body he already fits na quite well and the needed resources to achieve this adaption he took back in china - so all props to him!
829634,you're supposed to rush 40% cdr and ult every wave.
829644,"but then the people who make the games we love will get popular and make money and have the lives they deserve to have, and that makes them sell outs!"
829659,i thorut u cantt s33 0vr3 30 fps lel mnt dew.
829669,i can **already** tell the difference!
829694,zero tolerance policies are 100 percent fine.
829712,"ermahgerd riot cant fix ddos, worst company ev000r."
829745,microsoft did on purpose to get a bump in sales.
829751,and an eu team baiting baron has literally never happened before ever.
829757,this guy has a valid argument.. let's down vote.
829768,guess someone just lost to a lulu
829802,"yes, why wasn't there someone there to get every coin out as soon as it fell in?"
829848,you dont know that yet... one ap ratio i think is sufficient basis for building all ap i mean ap jinx is completely viable because of her ap ratio on her chompers
829862,because the people that comment on youtube and twitch are totally different from the people that comment on reddit
829863,"it's just a qol change, not a buff"
829935,your eyes can't tell the difference betwen 30fps and 60fps i'd rather have my cinematic experience.
829961,"oh i am sorry that i writte something wrong in my second language, i am truly sorry for that"
829987,back when the game was actually hard!
830048,let riot do what they want because it's not like their height affects gameplay.
830073,you sound like a really great guy!
830081,"you mean, the 'disagree button'"
830146,"yes, i truly miss having a crosshair on the awp."
830160,"yeah, his 4k on cache was totally legit."
830164,i'm sure they couldn't pay 2 extra teams otherwise

830187,just spray at them while jumping; you'll be fine
830195,"oh, i was looking for tech support that couldve helped me in the 30s i had to select a champ"
830204,"yeah, why would he try to knife in a game that had no standing on their league status in a round they couldn't possibly lose?"
830214,i feel like the other daily posts about this haven't gotten the point across
830220,"i agree, that is what won them the series"
830229,"sounds like a big problem, guess i won't be purchasing either"
830239,"yeah you're right, that's probably why in tournaments players use one color the whole time because it's basically the same."
830312,"ah i finally reached the high elo heaven of silver iii, i can die now"
830318,yeah this hasnt been posted before

831363,this just in: charging money for access to content is very anti-consumer.
831399,i forgot how nidalee has such great counterplay because her primary ability is a skillshot.
831453,i fully support going on threads about a game i think is terrible so i can talk about how terrible it is.
831501,"yeah exactly, those shitty d5 players!"
831520,"because our community is so nice to be with, no toxic players at all, no one is raging or flaming ever, we're all reasonable adults playing this strategy game while enjoying it instead of arguing about pointless things right?"

832066,pretty sure its pronounced bye-zone like the way the warowl says it.
832070,"yeah, these hospital children are the worst, not appreciating a great game."
832193,because the problem with kayle had nothing to do with lich bane...

834322,"yeah lets forget the pvp, that's such a small part of the game"

836780,they are busy fixing other vital stuff in cs:go such as wallbanging/hitreg/netcode...
836822,"but he won five whole games.. he deserves it, the system must be bugged"
836873,"yea, rather you should look down on each other, and insult each other, go!"

838060,"see guys, league is a real sport"
838129,"i can clearly see in lower elo how easy it is to time stuff... its not like 2nd red constantly gets done like 2 mins late there because they forget about their stuff... or free drakes for people because they forgot about that ... i can clearly see how it requires no skill, that's why everyone is so good at this..."
838139,just like all the vision now that everyone has a free ward.
838282,yeah it's really his job to be the front line and keep trundle off of his teammates
838285,oh come on everyone knows all working men and women have more than enough time to wake up at 3am and hit download.
838346,"make him the tree of the void, then."
838385,to let us all know how good he is (cause we clearly care)
838390,"and here i am buying games so that i can play them, instead of getting free things like some chump."
838397,i'm sure none of the champs you play are annoying at all.
838432,the best part of this is the name of the game in the title
838476,riot thinks that w bug helped gambit stomp bot and mid
838489,"yeah, fuck all those free games and server improvements!"
838595,"obviously a copy paste of 1.6, the only real cs game."

838989,yeah and it won't be coming to canada yay!
838994,wow i was so surprised by your title and subsequent answer!
839000,yeah i'm sure the fact that she's a girl has nothing to do with it.
839002,"i've never known a rogue to use all offensive cooldowns, then vanish and run when it is obvious that you will win."
839005,what part of omni do you not get?
839058,"oh man, lets all run over to the xbox camp and moon them!"
839064,ohhh that explains why they are only available in creative mode!
839076,they probably cut the budget so they'd have more money to roll around in.
839108,"yeah, it's really annoying, riot should already implement all the necessary features so people stop complaining and switching to other games."
839195,"reddit personal army, at your service..."
839241,totally not a transphobic asshole
839307,"pc gamers can never be wrong, they're always right, and they're always better."
839319,god they're pro players stop treating them like human beings fuck
839343,i don't think it has enough slows...
839359,"hahahahahha so obv, gl on overwatch ;)))"
839394,"asking the winner of the cosplay contest how long it took to make his costume... yeah, so annoying"
839416,"well obviously it's all your fault, you are directly responsible"

839436,"so blizz is going through with the whole time travel bullshit, whoo"
839437,this post is frontpage quality!
839445,bhopping is such a healthy mechanic
839487,"omg this isn't an indicator, we need more indicators"
840203,but we can't see past 24 eff-pee-ass tho.
840249,"yep, adults only on playstation"
841160,maybe they should quit now before the ruin someone's memories of laser tag
841183,i'm pretty sure approximately 98% of all toons in shat had both warglaives anyways :p
841193,voice chat would be so useless in solo queue.
841384,"yeah reddit, let's downvote him for turning his lights off."
841404,i think that should be the reason why newly formed alliance roflstomped dignitas.
841433,it is so hard to know which 2 teams will get out
841434,and other teams are trying hard and not testing their limits
841529,"also there's this thing where a bunch of bullets come out in front of her in a cone, but i can't see the yellowy-orange or purple bullets"
841715,i know right that huge shield isn't much of an indicator
841800,"oh yeah, this little qol change would certanly tip shen over the edge into pick/ban territory."
841953,"still, now that microsoft owns mojang, i would suspect you, a sony employee/contractor, to try to discredit the deal and make it seem bad so minecraft won't be worth as much and the game will fail, all because you were hired by sony i mean, call me a conspiracy theorist all you want, but i'm sure that's what's happening here"
841964,i'm really glad you guys are giving this helpful feedback because riot has probably never heard it before.
842035,no he doesn't he analyzes them professionally
842052,"yes, because having a degree automatically makes you follow what you were taught."
842098,them koreans miss flash e's and flash q's on lee all day.
842103,malph and nautilus wanna have a word with you.
842113,"they can get crysis to stream to the shield portable, but a wireless controller seems to be too much of a technical hurdle."
842195,...but he's not iconic enough to make it into smash!
842206,"you done goofed, thats worth atleast $60."
842216,ah yes the eukr team with only 1kr on the starting roster amirite fk tsm because they want foreign talent right
842232,the exact behavior riot expects from reformed players.
842323,"yes because in a sub as big as this it is impossible to have people that have actual knowledge from those areas, right?"
842348,"but it's reddit, don't you know that everyone in the comments section knows better than op and that he deserves to be judged?"
842371,thanks again microsoft for supporting the move to go digital
842385,"oh yea, farming has never been a thing in any mmo ever!"
842429,typical blood elf: rude and obnoxious.
842556,obviously professional feedback here guise i'm sure that flair is accurate
842592,no best adc is obviosuly doublelift.
842593,yah but in my one game he ended 10/0 with the most gold so your point is negated
842595,those fucking greedy gms always trying to make gold off of the player
842665,but bungie that defeats the purpose of raids since randoms can't complete it
842717,"what do you mean, black people?"
842835,yeah cuz bragging about petty thievery on reddit will definitely be his downfall...
842840,this is so incredibly necessary
842846,"just pretend you have thresh's e when playing kassadin, this will separate the good kassadins from the great kassadins."
842858,"whoah, no one has noticed this in the past 3 weeks at all, i promise!"
842868,yay let's nerf affliction into the ground some more.
842882,"oh boy, this circlejerk never gets old"
842978,"you sound like a great overwatcher, wish we had more like you"
843016,"yeah, because having a shit computer is completely the problem."
843109,"oh, well that makes everything better!"
843196,"yeah, since there's obviously nothing wrong with ruining the game for less-skilled players and steamrolling them because you can't play with people at your rank."
843204,"yeah, valve should fix not being able to boost **through** things in go."
843211,"conformity is cool, right guys?"
843274,"and xj9 too, while we're at it?"
843285,and i have 37ms this is bullshit!
843289,yes all of these statistics are referring to the same single pc..
843294,it's not like the game is drastically changing in season 5
843311,"i was pretty sure she didn't have cooldowns, so maybe that is why"
843348,so it's your fault we're getting this!
843409,"shhh, your not allowed to talk about pc on this subreddit"
843453,but i played overpass at nova 3 and i like it so it will be great at competitive play!
843464,i'm pretty sure we'll see a full version have a pricing error and sold at 5$.
843468,great thing about jokes is that they never ever get old or annoying.
843481,wow that's a brand new strategy
843533,"no man's sky looks like garbage, right?"
843589,"now that they got gambit out of the way, next on the list is..."
843629,shen because he has clearly had a huge impact this season.
843699,i forget dae consoles literally hitler?
843701,"yes, because riot are extremely good at removing/filtering offensive speech."
843729,"i don't know, have you seen how much all the sims expansions cost?"
843763,stoked for this sub to be overtaken my screenshots for a few weeks.
843765,lel pizza so funee 10 out of 10 comedy gold u r next seinfeld
843767,riot should stop trying to fuck over gambit
843787,probably just a gold wii u tablet or something.
843788,i want a real cinematic experience so i blink 6 times a second to get to 24 fps which is the only true cinematic experience.
843842,oh my god those nicknames triggered me so hard
843867,because 100% of division v players bought accounts/got boosted/lucky
843868,"thank god, everyone wanted to pick him"
843887,you mean they're useful for more than excel?
843912,but there is only one british youtuber talking about video games and it's tb!
843950,"good job tagging that image with a spoiler, op."
843956,hey...sounds like asia(n media).
843962,lee sin is the most balanced champ cause all the pros agree that he is
843973,"no guys this will make the game too easy, just like jungle timers"
844011,"that's why they have sister teams, so they don't have to scrim against the same team often!"
844064,"wtf man use the spoiler tag, you ruined it for me"
844129,"lol scrubz, i only get awp dragonlores"
844134,about 2 years if the devs maintain their current pace.
844135,because everyone else lives in a cabin in the woods and works on a submarine.
844167,"if there was one thing i was wanting from this new game, it was mega lopunny"
844191,your eyes cant see more that 24 fps so ye
844192,"today i learned that if people disagreed, people are upset"
844197,i think you mean an asianese word.
844198,holy crap there are a lot of anivia players out there :/
844205,because most people on reddit are diamond right?
844224,i too am pissed that a company made a game even existing popular and then thought to keep the rights to it!
844225,well at least now we know why they call it the xbone.
844230,not programmed in assembly 0/10
844258,obviously his stack passive thing is a better version of vayne's w and gives movespeed and he can poke with his boomerang
844266,yeah i remember the minecraft kickstarter
844283,"but the proceeds to go charity, so let's not question our rito overlords and just let them get away with it."
844289,"no, there's just no elo-hell on pbe"
844309,"well, he shouldn't have opted for pvp world that little bitch"
844339,i bet we won't even see heists by then
844344,but you're wrong because he said so!
844383,"yeah, fuck new players right, why should they ever have a good gaming experience?"
844391,that 1.0 ap ratio on flame chompers... idk ap jinx could be viable
844409,"yeah, that guy's a douchebag (who probably has mental problems), his whole life deserves to be ruined!"
844462,apparently too busy pretending monte is a real coach to send out shirts.
844485,yes because clearly there is no strategic reason for giving an ad carry solo exp and farm and clearly no top teams in korea or china use this strategy on a regular basis despite having world class bot lane duos
844509,"you are trivializing rape, shitlord."
844535,sir that honor goes to top gun thank you very much
844541,when playing amumu you want to use your full combo on the enemy maokai because amumu does % hp damage.

844743,wow yes that's how genetics work!
844746,looks like pc graphics are finally good enough to move up from my nes!
844747,i bet telling him he's upsetting you will make that troll stop what he's doing and really think about his actions
844750,yep i can really see that clg mod bias here
844767,this post appeared to be entirely consistent with the rules of this subreddit.
844837,"yes, because the majority of the community is challenger level and will have people allow them their preferred roles every time, so they don't need rune pages or champs for the rest of the roles."
844872,til there are no white people in brazil
844937,that's very righteous of you to determine how and what helps people learn and improve
844955,"the sight ward and vision ward last for differing amounts of time, there has to be a visual indicator to distinguish between the two."

845678,it perplexes me why people buy consoles too!
845702,"s1 main smurfing in s5, get on my level bra."

849234,yea it's almost like they should have some kind of beta audience where these sorts of issues are tested before releasing to everyone.
849288,because company size changes the morality of issue.

855708,"finally, someone recognises my brilliance"
855710,you can't silence my loud noises freedom of speech that means i can say whatever i want without reprocussions

856736,everyone knows you can't have story *and* gameplay that would just be crazy.
856762,"they're really good, the game is just unfair to them and its really random who wins and no skill is involved so they use cheats to make it fair so they can show their true skill without the effort required."
856796,yes because their playstyle doesnt need to change at all.
856878,"hahahaha you got me good, funny man."
856881,they delayed it so people will cave and buy the full version.
856891,"clearly, it doesn't work with asian faces..."

857462,"you know, because i'm sure that the people with the necessary money to buy the content and not pirate it would turn off the adblock"
857489,obvs he heard the players with his $1000 headset
857502,they did make up for it with november's awesome catalog of free games!
857597,they should just release a paid version without ads
857617,"oh wow, you're so creative, that's totally not an archaic meme from nearly a decade ago"
857638,they have to spend extra resources to announce console sales which could have been used to make more games
857639,"you guys are right, this was the wrong move representing over 50% of the population."
857690,doesn't matter our eyes can only see 30fps
857830,"yeah, because infinity ward are so shitty and just produce the worst games right?"

858093,"maybe she wanted hp regen, tiamat does have nice regen."
858097,i bet the population would rather pay to not get flooded by nerds for a whole month!
858153,"so bm rito plz fine totally unnecessary could have finished handshake earlier, intentionally speaking to get more screen time ."
858158,they're obviously too busy eating fried chicken to yell at the screen
858166,"the eye has trouble making out the shapes of the letters when not focusing on them, making it hard to read they must have recorded it in a frame rate greater than 30fps - i hear the eye can't make out anything greater than that."

858285,"yeah and lee shield is just a shield, nothing else"
858297,"well, just wait till they unleash the power of the cloud"
858301,because the base opinion of everyone is supposed to be that ea is shitty no matter what even if they do some good things
858338,you should learn the powers if soil erosion
858358,that's a great reason to downvote a discussion.
858371,"don't forget to make fiddlesticks immune to cc while he's channeling, gotta level the playing field."
858393,"yea, an awp definitely costs the same as a rifle."
858409,"because lord knows when a remaster, that can be done by a small team in a short period of time, is started, what ever game they may be working on is put on hold"
858480,but according to tumblr everyone's gay on the inside!
858489,good thing the eye can only see 24 fps
858523,"in na the top 10 around 7 are adc, there's wildturtle, wildturtle smurf, wildturtlesmurf , smurf turtle smurf , wildturtle smurf, vasili, wildturtle smurf and wildturtle throwaway account."
858527,"i feel like people aren't giving jinx enough credit, she perfectly set the whole play up"
858540,omfg i'm so sick of these stealth buffs they are ruining my champs zero counterplay op
858563,720p on 30fps is by far superior ^^\.
858592,there's no way they can find eye candy in southern cali
858605,"well, obviously they should've just remade the game from the ground up!"
858621,"it means check your privilege, you white, cisgender pig-bigot d;"
858644,"i think that the community should be free to do what it wants, i mean look at the bastions of quality the defaults are with their minimal moderator intervention"
858685,29 more days before it's up again.
858712,"had a chance to talk with stephanie back when it was loneclash, she was really supportive, better support than bubbadub"
858764,regi is so clever coach and genios person
858779,b-but they don't even speak english
858790,"yea i mean it's pretty dickish, the next speaker has to bend over to pick it up.."
858800,if you played sin you automatically hate women.
858835,"working as intended, to separate the *good* junglers from the *great* ones."
858837,obviously because everything you've posted doesn't have over 2k karma your opinion is invalid.
858892,"oh shit, you're right, better flash into them"
858897,i'd care if my cd key was working... thanks steam!
859030,oh yes they are losing so much money when i emulate a game they haven't sold for years.
859031,they get some good practice from rehashing their games over and over.
859032,til muting also prevents teammates from seeing pings!
859159,"well the good ones need at least someone to initiate with them to ace you, the great ones just run into your team and get a pentakill."
859170,"yeah, i heard travis beats up anyone who doesn't interview with him."
859183,"great reply, obviously worth having a debate with you"
859185,so obviously valve wants to have terrible relationships with the community and to prevent people from wanting to submit anything to the workshop in the first place.
859216,that's a much more mature comment than any of mine.
859248,because 9mm round can destroy tanks and jets.
859266,yup i think we have the next etho
859284,"oooh, so those floaty things are called samus!"
859310,yes exactly why can't everyone have the same music taste as me so i don't have to feel superior when i hear someone listening to le (c)rap?
859374,i think they should tone her w down so it has the same cooldown as her ult and make it do no damage so its just used for the root cause lissandra is so broken right now and i don't think i'll ever play this game again until they nerf her...
859378,"well, it is not a competitive map and its only use is to goof around.."
859416,b-b-but he showed me the middle finger d:
859456,this is probably a great thread to express such an opinion
859473,her neck isn't *nearly* long enough
859536,after this last week... i didn't know essex was doing non satirical articles now.
859571,"yes, we should add in a feature which requires a great deal of teamwork to one of the most toxic game environments of all time, and expect it to go over well."
859621,increasing trinket cooldown is a band aid for this.
859638,"man, 57 hours sure is a long time!"
859681,titanfall is the bestest game ever made and no one dislikes it because it's the best!
859688,"what're you talking about, i just love my 150 average ping from the 90-103 i used to get!"
859708,should have spent less time healing and more time dealing damage ya scrub
859786,"good argument, lots of legit points in there, really a lot to ponder in my life."
859804,"yes, obviously one person out of 370,374 people is representative of the whole"
859881,but faesbuk iz a hitler downboat antisagan evil corprashun!
859882,nah m8 we just wanna ask questions
859927,pfff no way dude there are 10 bugs every game just like that one riot pls fix your game
859939,"yeah, he really does suck, missing an active."
859963,cause nidalee cougar form w is literally riftwalk
859999,"yeah microsoft should just add backward compatibility, and while they're at it might as well make it to where we can play ps4 games on it too."
860030,it will be implemented with the new client soon(tm).
860057,but they're on the most losing teamcomp!
860135,"omg no, i'm an investor and i'm sooo disappointed in xbox one not outselling ps4!"
860154,"ye, he sure wasn't a top level adc by na standards what so ever"
860167,"yea $50 difference is huge, plus the include game."
860193,"that hadn't occurred to me, thank you"
860242,gotta train hard to move those chess pieces.
860264,actually just mark that we can last hit as well.
860308,they lost the last two bo3s (one vs c9 and one vs gambit)... yea they are not the same anymore.
860341,but you can't do 5 supports on one team!
860431,i'm booting up my ddos infrastructure.
860446,"but haven't you heard, us sales are the only ones that matter, and xb1 was leading in december."
860548,but adc is the most important class everyone should cater to them at all times since they are all the dps!
860552,well that sounds like a legit assumption
860558,"and it doesn't matter that the enemy has baron and a 5k gold lead, no, instead of turtling and farming and waiting out baron, we must dance in mid vs leona, vi and malph and then blame the vayne for defending the last bottom inhib turret instead of getting caught and dying with the team."
860573,"nah, how else would i get to feel superior?"
860634,"40% of ap ratio on q was deleted; no, you're right, it was totally reasonable, not a knee-jerk overreaction at all."
860666,you forgot to post a link to the website and talk about the free credits they are offering.
860734,yea screw him for wording his title in a certain way.
860745,\
860754,it should just level up on it's own and the items should be bought automatically aswell.. i even want the game to cast the spells for me so all i have to do is move the champ because this game is sooo hard.
860772,well then i guess the fun i had in the beta was shortlived because it's not 1080p in the full game.
860773,"nah, using your escape with a 20s cooldown to clear jungle camps is a great idea!"
860789,yeah because levels designed around waist-high walls every 10 feet is good gameplay.
860809,"yeah, fuck those people trying to do a good thing for charity, right?"
860834,this was certainly incarnati0n's fault.
860835,"oh i'm sorry, i just get annoyed when people call me elitist bullshit, it's totally my fault."
860861,that's what they're *trying* to get you to do...
860862,as if that's the worst think people would see in my room...
860863,"yea, like you'll ever meet him in a game."
860868,yeah because all cops follow the law.
860892,"to be fair, 624.9 is a lot bigger than 40."
860895,i'm glad to see you support the cause
860933,yes because indie games are amazing and not wasteful.
860935,but polygon was supposed to be x1 biased.
860976,couldn't i just download the twitch app with the added bonus of getting the wonderful chat experience?
860991,it's not like people who don't use bots are affected.
861045,this guy knows how game development works
861114,qtpie hacked the rp to get all the urgod skins.
861116,"human eye can't see more than 1 fps anyways, also it gives the gif a cinematic feeling."
861120,"but the traps are spell thief stacks and you have a steal, so you're a support"
861131,dont worry theyve been lurking and just made one for this ;) lol
861137,coc is pretty expensive where i come from
861317,and then they ask why eu is better
861463,"we're true veterans, we survived 2 days without psn make it happen mods!"
861922,don't forget the amazing mouse lifting flusha taught him.
862348,well this worked really well for us last year so i can't see the fault in this logic.
862889,sure thing max bonerstorm ill definitely take your word for it you seem like a smart guy.
863035,"yeah, i still remember how velkoz just wrecked everyone on release."
863207,oh wow yes the server owners are the ones to blame for this and there is no hypocrisy at all on mojang's side!
863265,"with his insane amount of dps, sustain via ability and life steal, nice as steroid and 1v5 carry potential, he certainly isn't."
863366,ask it to the people that are praising valve for everything that they are doing for the game.
863390,let's boycott all games that do this yeah!
863405,"because it's said twenty dollars, not dollars twenty"
863474,inb4 everypost next month +maj3r -sf
863500,"obviously, if lucian gets closer, his gunshots will be more accurate and quite possibly head-shot her for the kill."
863574,"his silence does not apply his passive, now however, we have a whole 0.1 secs of 10% more damage, i'm so impressed riot"
863647,"yea, it's like they picked this random guy out of the crowd and said hey let's fuck this guy up for no reason"
863715,why aren't cheats allowed aswell?
863731,i know ... and i meant it as a joke ...
863736,"half of them are reddit users, but yeah you guys are still better than everyone don't worry!"
863870,even more proof that nintendo is obviously gonna fail.
863875,"you said white, you racist bastard."
863888,this is hilarious and i've never seen this before.
863909,they realized that they could just keep expanding wow every few years!
864132,"whatcha talking about, he' *just a zone mage*"
864325,"i know right, who calls it an eggplant!"
864345,sounds like elo hell trapped you foreveer
864379,that's what happens when you miss the apex!
864395,"it's been a year, another delay wont kill you"
864485,it really starts to get fun after hour 100
864488,because everything has to be perfect or else the game is complete garbage
864499,"did he have shroud's consent, was this rape?"
864541,no youll get awp dragon lorr sourvieeerrr fn go buy on noawww.
864542,omfg this is outrageous i took a day off to play 6.0.2 today wtf blizz
864554,this is the content i love to see on this subreddit
864592,hint: the title should probably be followed with a
864611,"wildturtle leaves tsm because ''they're fking trolls noobs feeders'', chaox again in tsm, dyrus benched for actitude problems."
864624,"oh my god bjergsen has turned into such a whiny hipster since he joined tsm, look at the immaturity"
864740,"yeah, i missed that one too, but then again, it's just a wildcard team, na and eu pros must do that in a daily basis."
864795,"hahahaahahahahahahhaahhahaahh look at this guy, cracking jokes lol"
864846,"its totally fine for a pistol that people sometimes use instead of rifle, its not like it was better than deagle that costs 300 more lol!"
864847,"human eye can only see 30 fps, so you dont need more than 30 fps"
864921,yeah man c9 should definitely get rid of their shot caller and replace him with someone who doesn't speak english!
864932,hexakill on summoner's rift was very entertaining...
864963,"yes, because 1 kick = 7 day ban."
864983,"yes, because, as we all know, the entire games industry is located in a communist state where every developer has an equal amount of funds and resources at their disposal with which they can develop games."
864999,"moe, cly, pigskin, moe, and pewdiepie"
865047,"hey, there you go.. you're learning pretty quickly.. good for you...since you know, you all have sub 70 iqs on average..i figure it would be tough for you to understand..but yuou're doing well."
865075,it's good to know that riot cares about it's alternate map players enough to put out a hotfix.
865181,"back then, adc itemization was diversified"
865291,you're absolutely right: it's the artists killing the industry...
865294,"if you mean a game that clearly states what the state of it is, that it is ea, that is deep and gets tons of regular updates, then yes, it's a cancer"
865428,"gee, i never expected them to release another ff!"
865430,because we all know win rates are totally indicative of how balanced a champion is right?
865431,"nah he's a god, has never lost lane once and always goes 11/0/16."
865444,"yes, because there is no time in the lane where you don't autoattack for 3 seconds."
865478,yes rito so dumb at managing company we should all uninstall
865486,and obviously we have to be like dota.
865529,bro the human eye cant even see more then 30 fps so i dont see what the big deal is
865544,"please dont post jokes likes this, this is way too hilarious, i laugh way too hard, i might die."
865549,"oh well, in that case who needs a tryout"
865616,because dota 2 is so easy to get into
865627,"gee, i wonder if this is malware"
865643,"oh thx couldnt read, enjoy your free karma, cause u definately need it"
865667,less than 50% winrate with a low pick rate is so strong
865681,"that's such a unique idea, no one ever thought of it and it has no way to be abused."
865695,"yeah, because riot korea has access to military records of all of its players and when they're on active duty."
865733,you're the first person to ever post this!
865741,because nintendo and sony love you sooo much.
865743,"didn't you hear, dyrus died a bunch in that one game yesterday so he's actually been bad for his entire career and is the sole reason tsm has been losing games"
865744,"close to 3275 community sticker capsules, ye"
865758,"yeah but, shitposting is okay if it's ironic, didn't you know?"
865798,"why bother learning, that would mean people have to take responsibility for their own actions, no its far better to just sure people."
865818,"uhhh, did you *see* how many views the video has?"
865821,but...but...there's little to no difference between 900p and 4k.
865871,something the game is free something stop complaining
865882,arent you hyped about reginald/oddone/xpecial lineup and tpa lineup of toyz/lilballz etc going to s4 worlds ?what more do you even want bro ?
865891,"why would you look at the bomb, that would obviously make you vunerable to ct's shooting you from behind"
865909,"well, it was being played on a xbox one"
865919,"yes, a petition will surely change the exclusivity."
865998,why can't we use smite on enemy champions?
866049,he has a flawless flame logic...
866052,"no this is a feature, you are invincible during jumps its working as intended."
866139,but muh 60hz wont be used in its full potential!
866157,yes he totally didn't mean the si episode with saint
866164,"it totally kills the euphoric feeling, doesn't it?"
866168,"yea, that way u can buy the game, then download it, then bring it in to gamestop and get a nice trade in value"
866169,lol maybe curse shouldve let them win a game or two to be nice.
866177,because cats and raccoons are the same thing.
866206,"they're analysts though, so their opinions means something?"
866322,he was so good with edward last split
866323,well all the lmq hype says it is.
866374,"nah dude, no way the 40 armor he got for free did anything in that melee fight"
866388,"well they need to nerf kassadin into the ground and not touch **my** champion, duh!"
866404,the best tactic is to rush bombsites together.
866447,ikr the game even says he's a support.
866451,"yes, when people think about cs they definitely have the color of enemies on the radar as the most defining thing about the game."
866464,"nope, you're the only person among millions of esports followers who are excited for the next split"
866589,yeah akali stealth and diana w will get you right out of that perma stun zone
866591,"because they obviously have the skills to work in that field when they applied for a completely different job, right?"
866596,"wow, mario kart ds looks a lot better than i remember!"
866622,you know im not a woman but i think giving birth is not painful at all
866651,"yeah right 55% win rate in every tier from bronze to challenger is totally balanced, my bad"
866656,"keep on logging in like everyone else, that way you will get your key faster!"
866673,"nah but his team won, it makes him a better fan than you"
866785,"oh man, that's totally gonna work bro."
866804,yea diamond 5-3 is so bad like they're just better than 98% of community so bad
866837,they really need to make a gritty first person shooter super mario reboot... this whole fun and laughing thing is rediculous.
866842,"god i love how this sub is 100 percent lcs spam and lcs tweets and pro fighting god this sub definitely isn't a total pile of shit, and the mods should definitely not kill themselves."
866850,"yeah, 'cause intelligent systems was planning on making majora's mask otherwise."
866869,make sure to disable your antivirus when updating the esea client so we can have a larger prize pool in the future!
866890,"don't worry guys - soon they will release the new battlefront, which will be totally awesome, and it definitely won't suffer from any of these problems or money-grabbing."
866896,because wukong is the only champion with built in amor pen
866955,that explains the 4 or so times he died.
866967,two of the funnest most mechanical and interesting champions
867035,"hey, you're not shaming riot or claiming that reddit is the best thing to happen to league, you're not allowed"
867037,i think the ouya controller gives it a run for its money.
867086,you also don't have to save up as much allowance when you want a new game.
867150,yup this sub only has like 10k lee sin flair so all of them are probably the same kind of toxic person
867158,"yes, because mob justice is always a great form of justice."
867184,there wouldnt be ragers if he wasnt a fkn feeder n respected when i called mid
867226,"yeah, he would be perfect though if he had a 100% attack speed buff..."
867306,lol and the red name above their head is good camo too...
867329,"to even this out, the next time darien plays aatrox, riot should quickly change the code so it procs every 4 times instead of every 3."
867337,"staph, your making me miss my network places"
867338,no they wouldn't try to destroy a market they get no money out of other than the os.
867362,"yeah not like ziggs has an aoe slow and an aoe knock back that propels him forward, why that would be absurd"
867368,"i suppose that was ok i mean, 1v4 quadra, not that impressive"
867388,"well he is right, plugging my controller is too much of a hassle to me so instead of charging it i buy a new controller every week!"
867412,"yeah, screw big screens and surround sound!"
867463,"nah he doesn't, pros don't play him in lcs so he must be unviable right?"
867470,"nonono, we only wanted people from other countries to help build it, now that we're here it's white only."
867580,"i really hope they make the deadline, seems like it will be tough to finish the bikes in time!"
867585,i forgot the game was about skins
867605,"yeah, i'd love to see a huge roided out spidey :p"
867611,obviously the ps4 has gddr5 which makes thinks much better then the pc and the xbox one has sram which is so revolutionary and good that it maybe even be capable to display at 4k with 60fps but that doesnt matter because our eyes cant see above 30 fps.
867630,i see that they have stopped taking down games after he stopped streaming them... it's definitely because of him that those games went down
867725,so you like how consistent wallbanging is?
867726,"this surely has no chance for abusal, unlike flipnote studio and swapnote!"
867743,"thanks for telling me what exactly happens in the video, i'm blind."
867760,"abilities all together are broken, i just want to stand still and auto attack people until one team wins."
867801,because kz isn't getting nerfed on pbe
867802,how did you get your account if you didn't buy it o.o
867900,better get a new client then...
867942,great contribution... have some reddit bronze.
867950,look at germany in the 1920s and look at germany now.
867988,yeah it would be fantastic if it was on a drm-free platform like steam!
868013,"we can obviously see that by his banrate in professional tournaments.kassadin isn't op, it's just the community that doesn't know how to deal with him, and the professionals."
868031,"obviously, lulu is a dirty support peasant and she should know her place, that is bot lane."
868047,i didn't know mindcraft was still popular.
868081,introducing team ragequit: top: hotshotgg mid: reginald adc: chaox support: chauster jungle: saintvicious ...the team synergy would be amazing
868100,"performance enhancing drugs, calling it right now."
868132,"but switching to red makes it faster, so it's worth it"
868142,"well, minecraft xbox one edition is an exclusive."
868164,they oversized the heat sink just in case.
868186,til that stationary monochrome red/black 1x224 display is equivalent to a 1920x1080 full color display that can track rotation and eventually physical space translation
868226,"no man, he is just lifting his mouse a lot."
868229,sell your vulcan and buy 100 predeators then.
868236,time to go play football on the fields of war.
868251,no clue what you are talking about man
869212,"everyone is so fucking thick, they actually do not know"
869524,because csgol odds vs c9 are more even so ibp doesn't throw.
869565,"also because na = america, and eu = only england and nowhere else, and eu is still mad that we fought back ther fascist invasion of the colonies and won our independence from king stalin during ww 1 in the 1890s."
869601,they shouldn't do sales anymore because *everyone* has ea access.
870171,"why should they, if they look good enough?"
870183,"dude if they lost the war, then the clearly started it."
870210,fucking dota ruining it for everybody
870264,but riots coding doesnt have bugs does it?
870317,but lucian is clearly the only counter to tristana and thats the reason they always play it against her.
870328,"because if you have to find the said's entrance you don't have time to do it, but spending twice as much time wiping in lfr is fine."
870412,"eqnext - clone of wow...well, its an mmo...which we all know wow was the first"
870696,"yes, because first thing i think of when i play solo q is this talon fellow sure does need a buff"
870703,"because that makes it so much better instead of adding another issue, amirite?"
870705,yeah there is some sort of weird phenomenon where the bad players only end up on your team and not the other team
870712,this is new information we have not been talking about for days.
870716,because you are the judge of that
870744,people like sven sure are keeping this game free for people like us!
870771,yea too bad they didn't get queen or michael jackson to do it
870810,"oh fuck, not only do i need to have a computer to play computer games, but now i need a $200 phone, too?"
870818,you should give them a tutorial
870824,because it wasn't wide scale misogyny and doxxing that did it.
870870,how good is the step up from intel gma x4500?
870921,"yah such good guys valve gives you hats for free... oh wait, they don't.. nevermind."
870922,"sush, le pc mastur race has spoken."
870942,omgf fucking pay2win multiboxer scum
870946,not hard to make top 5 when there's only been 7 xbox one games this year
870973,obviously riot must ban them from the world championship and forfeit their win against tsm.
871006,let's just ban people for using skype then?
871042,the error was that jet ski level was never supposed to make final production
871059,"whats that, you told that person who was cutting in line to not you mother fucker did you know in africa theres people trying to get in line to get some chicken but cant then die people like you should be hung"
871062,yea and na is full of fucking divine players
871149,still waiting for that tutorial
871151,"my mistake, killing the enemy never gives you any advantage."
871241,"bur what if they have something important to say, like why you're trash and why you should go kill yourself?"
871282,"because when else have non fps/f2p games been released recently, i can't name one that came out in the last 3 years!"
871304,this is the crew from doomsday preppers and i'd like to look at your world.
871336,this is an issue that happens every single game and is absolutely in need of change.
871375,"nono, the gap has become closer.. see, we actually put up much more of a fight than last year!"
871386,cuz typing in the name in the searchbar takes so long...
871458,"if rito already has security concerns, i could see this going well..."
871479,but it's next-gen so obviously the game has to reinvent the wheel.
871563,"yeah, that 30 seconds time saved will sure pay off"
871564,"k uninstall, this game has gone to hell"
871599,"but what if we go to year 3014, then it would be too confusing to new players"
871608,he's obviously too good to play against the na teams
871694,yeah lets have turtle making a vlog crying about amazing after a few days since it was announced amazing was going to leave!
871829,do you even bacon at midnight bro
871908,yeah peke played terrible at wolrds
871985,to be fair i could really see mata replacing hai
871986,nearly pulling an ace is by all means an absolute failure especially the knife part like seriously horrible play ...
872060,because so many people have two screens to nitpick the pixel differences between 900p and 1080p
872146,yea that sk remake was totaly because they are russian.
872162,"the damage has been done, what this random stranger said to me playing the same game as me will effect me forever, let me go make a reddit post crying about how toxic the community is."
872205,"stupid fucking game developers, can't you see that we don't want technological improvement?"
872281,"it's m$, and besides, its really old right?"
872314,"we need more skins for lee sin, syndra and ziggs!"
872380,"yeah, wait until it goes live when you can't do anything about it."
872403,i never thought they'd milk it even further
872421,"oh well fuck, i guess if jontron disagrees no one's allowed to like a game."
872434,"well damn, nice console graphics you have there..."
872439,yea and battle bunny riven has no armor so therefore she should have armor and mr reduction right?
872448,"wow i can't begin to imagine the length of these queues, just to play a beta"
872481,yeah because deman and joe are like super inexperienced and awkward
872506,"but it should be because every time a new cod game comes out, its always a massive improvement over the previous one"
872546,"*gasp* a company trying to make money, the humanity!"
872591,"she's really easy to play, just use a script."
872608,yes that is exactly what happened
872628,"i don't think riot would want to step in on sjw territory, they're kind of cishet-loving shitlords."
872630,"you really can't joke about such an serious, gamebreaking topic!"
872655,and she's high skill high reward because her skill shot is so hard to land.
872656,oh know didn't you know the ps4's 1080p is better than the xbox one's 1080p?
872708,"yeah, which is why they have loads of beta feedback threads up on the forums"
872752,"the obsidian is below the gold, don't you see it?"
872770,"oh yeah, getting to play mgs4 for only $7 is such a bad deal for us non -ps3 owners..."
872771,"yeah, i can't wait for the day that a game has all its resources in the cloud and i have to be connected online just to play a single player game!"
872787,yeah fighting for 7th place in the na lcs must be a real reward.
872826,"release a beta, of a game which has been released already that you can play on the 360... good idea"
872849,no im no lowballer k im pro trader been in dis business 4 years and ever after k im now lowballer fucking skurblord gtfo of here psttt
872882,yeah i'm in silver so i guess i must not be trying
872917,"wow mithy so toxic, rito banerino pls"
872918,im sure it was the reddit post that got them their money
872940,as a professional elo booster i can only strongly contradict!
872943,more maps is what this game really needed.
873035,but the print screen button prints my screen... and i don't want to waste paper.
873059,i never would have guessed that blizzard would have incorporated any kind of pop culture references in their game!
873086,holy hell... just figured out rito is an anagram for riot... illerminarty.
873099,totally wasn't an already made joke..
873123,"b..b..but we want to go mundo, renekton, shyvana and she beats us and that's sew nawt fare!"
873132,"yes, showing sarcasm is so hard to do with text"
873150,"this is totally racist and unfunny, and everyone should be offended by that expression, right ?"
873158,"finally, proof he's account sharing!"
873202,damn dude it must be hard to kill someone you xounterpick 2x in a row
873213,you seem like a very sensible young man.
873228,gotta get doublelift snowballing cause everybody else on this team is trash!
873258,"because, you know, it's impossible to be unemployed but searching and have free time at the same time."
873306,"yeah, but surely that wouldn't happen now."
873331,thank god for the xbox live status page - where would we be without it!
873361,"hold a sec, there are multiple cities in sk?"
873453,"yeah we should ignore any coaching if the coach themselves can't play well, like monte"
873455,"truly, we live in the age of tomorrow."
873503,"they dont need drugs, they have tons of energy drinks."
873532,atmong meta was by far the best meta
873602,because mid lulu hasn't seen any play this year.
873608,dude moakai is broken on 3's im srs fr
873616,pixel art games look better than 1886 because 1080p/60fps.
873644,what the fuck does fun have to do with video games?
873748,woah man who said anything about a penis?
873762,because they can only do one thing at a time.
873771,"ohhh it's a good thing all mentally ill people have a history of violence and no identification, don't have $200, and are in the fbi database of people with a history of mental illness (which isn't a complete disqualifier)."
873798,"damn, if only players in na and eu could change that fast."
873816,yeah and we should remove creative mode because creative people can just go play another game!
873833,but we want it at a more cinematic 24fps
873859,aww man guess i can't have jump on my scroll then
873864,reddit still does it but i'm a cool hipster who doesn't follow the mainstream.
873881,"yes,he also confirmed l4d3 and portal3 in his qna"
873892,going to nip has worked out amazingly for the lemondogs
873895,oh well in the original video i thought they were all the same guy.
873903,"when na players thrashtalk eu its all for fun and hype, but when eu thrashtalks na its immature and bm..."
873905,"except it can play vita games, remote play with a ps4, works with ps now, and you can connect a ds3/4 to it... so exactly like an amazon fire tv..."
873919,i think i'm gonna wait 'til it drops to 89% before i officially call it quits.
873948,you shouldn't ever main a champ that isn't constantly banned.
873959,because making games is super cheap and easy and they should prioritize the smaller markets to maximize profits.
874018,"thankfully, luigi's already been revealed, so panic's over."
874164,"obviously he does not just have a bad day like everyone else has, he is just an arrogant douche bag."
874165,"i dont go on games at work, that would be irresponsible and unproductive."
874227,"thx pls no, it would be so amusing to hear how koreans are the best all games long"
874231,"yeah, we need more professional and interesting casters.. like joe buck!"
874351,**16:9 is better than 4:3 in every way possible and you are a bad player if you use 4:3**
874381,"bro, it's all numbers and letters, how can i game not handle that shit"
874436,"thanks, i didn't understand what he was talking about before."
874463,"yeah, i never would have guessed you need to disregard everyone else's needs to be evil without that description."
874496,because gunkata is a totally viable and realistic method of future combat
874572,yeah... let's make them warding bi*** again...
874579,"omg it's an alpha you entitled casual, that means it isn't at all a problem that the game is completely broken and anyone who says differently needs to stop hating on the dev team which i masturbate to so feverishly but delivers so very little to me in the end"
874581,must have figured out how to plug in a usb drive into his head and run the hax that way.
874601,it's carmine from gears of war.
874611,yeah how someone has turned a older title into a breathtaking new experience is way more boring than posts about why you're afraid of water because of the mario eel or why we need a remake of battlefront 3 for the millionth time
874615,"yeah, that booty isn't stable enough for my fight stick, hotas, or racing wheel!"
874616,"you're right, who can resist all those futas?"
874627,ain't no sauce like that special sauce.
874720,oh yea because the human eye can't see past 2fps so this is completely true
874792,that's some solid science there!
874825,"i know right, league isn't realistic anymore."
874896,"yes, because the 1.8 snapshots make it sooo difficult to repair things"
874908,"well i don't know about you, but i was always a fan of drowning in two feet of water."
874940,clearly a worthwhile front page post
875054,but i want to be able to drive 100 miles an hour through the city and avoid all the bullshit cops that appear out of nowhere.
875071,"don't listen, nobody ever got anything out of school math is dumb you will literally never do math after high school"
875093,"yeah, shame on him for having opinions!"
875227,i hear riot is working on a patent for that.
875229,because we are gamers we need games to be harder just for the sake of being harder
875237,"yea, i'm so genuinly excited to play another micro-transaction-steeped, mind-numbing piece of so-called entertainment..."
875276,yes i loved the complete lack of depth perception which made avoiding the raid-wiping mechanics incredibly easy.
875308,"but they are so edgy and cool fucking up the holiday for other gamers, they don't need none of that love stuff."
875451,i'm sorry...but your sister looks like a dude.
875523,"based on the weight of the box, he should have realized it was either rocks or an xbox one inside."
875541,and to think they gave the rest of the world server issues.
875619,"dont worry guys, vac will catch him."
875685,"weak cheat, doesn't even show which way they're looking."
875810,"yeah, one day to get 650+ so easy."
875988,"but surely as an mmo, it will provide a better experience on console, right?"
876474,"it's 3250 rp for his texture update, i dont get why you're complaining"
876829,"gosh darn these fancy commander blocks, back in my day we just had redstone!"
876976,it must already include access to diamond armor
877074,"don't worry, this expansion is as much about the alliance as it is the horde!"
877151,"oh yeah, that's not a hostile response *at all*."
877340,why would i want to be doublelift after today
877371,"true, they get all of those great other mojang games."
877401,omfg asylum guard op a hammer would never reach out that far
877557,but zed didnt try to ks last one so undeserved just given.
877727,"bbbut silence is toxic and has no counter play, literally."
877747,"well, that's like your opinion man, i totally dig that."
877755,someone got 20 kills in a row and got a supply drop
877860,yeah because people of any other religion or belief system do not kill people.
877915,not sure if trolling or for real.
877928,wow i wonder why people come up with stereotypical insults for westerns in asia
877998,so a few weeks ago sony says more news coming in a few weeks now it's a few weeks later and we have this confirmation awesome
878002,"yeah you are totaly right, why cant they already make a device you can connect wirelessly to your phone which looks, feels, works and is a controller"
878012,"or better yet, let us choose our champs in aram!"
878027,"absolutely means like, only one thing dont you know?"
878065,well we can't have a penta kill give you an edge!
878072,yes 1-clip melting bosses is overrated
878191,yeah cop's decision to step down from curse was definitely his own.
878200,it's not like overwatch is still in beta for 1 year without any updates
878239,the international fbi is going to sneak up on my house in sweden and grab me in the night
878242,"if he's better than you, he is hacking."
878250,now we just need replays and east coast servers am i right?
878318,oot is number 1 mario 64 is 2 pokemon r/b is 3 most original list ever
878357,i literally just thought of that!
878402,because those digital rune pages cost a lot of money to produce
878493,"if everyone that harass other ppl would be fired, the scene would be such a great place"
878528,use the unofficial sarcasm mark:
878607,but...somebody gave the account to him to frame him
878635,"full of un-minable iron, coal, and lapis luzuli ores"
878638,"your comment doesn't matter, it's currently 80 bucks, like i said, and the price will go up once again when they release another paid update but sure i'll be looking forward to the next time overkill decides to be oh so generous and reduce the price on their bloated game"
878641,well as the human eye can only see 30 fps my 4th eye will love that extra 24 fps.
878690,hey gais gaaiis...if we had beaten kabum we would've made it to finals too...right.
878847,"so good of you, now the people at riot can sleep tight!"
878859,"your opinion is wrong, it's garbage."
878872,"yeah, i mean why would we want video games to become a sport that plays on tv and gets recognized by others who thinks video games is just mindless violence?"
878879,"i haven't seen a single naked boob in trailer and i heard only one swear word, so they are still deep in t (teen) territory."
879003,"you can't argue with people by providing facts instead of well, he said claims...cause you know, you haven't played with him dammit!"
879064,because those clowns that like the box we don't like also get all that stuff.
879081,mixed race controllers make me sick
879120,25 up and like 3 down canadian internet ftw
879141,yea i loved to be 1 shotted by his q r combo
879156,"well, at least this frees them up to work on rage 2"
879159,yeah my internet sucks this feature is totally a gimmick
879165,"nothing beats pouring gas on someone, lighting them on fire then smashing them with a shovel, man video games sure are making me violent."
879170,ugh my eyes hurt now after watching this
879179,"now if only we could force you all to start using lbs., gallons, and miles."
879189,at least he gets to the point and saves everyone's time.
879232,amazing they could capture the essence of the american police force but not cash register basics.
879241,at least they know their market
879286,still more npcs than watch dogs.
879320,"yeah, let me link you the official valve statement"
879340,"so people stare each other in the eyes when passing one another in the streets, just like real life!"
879405,wipes are always the tank's fault.
879415,why don't you use the awesome runecombiner we have ?
879504,that explains why omg's jungle braum start failed...
879512,so glad you corrected him because he was obviously being serious
879581,"i'll give him 10 keys, looks ww"
879622,"but, now he can cast the as buff on himself if he uses his only gap closer, or flash."
879637,"i know, i was kidding lol should've added a"
879670,yeah everyone loves to bandwagon a middle-of-the-pack team in arguably the weakest region
879710,yeah because it's impossible to continue a story under a different title.
879715,can't wait for them to bring their wonderful content id system to twitch.
879733,it's not his fault his jungler doesn't camp for him.
879745,"i didn't realize winrar was a game, forgive me."
879748,w0w u got out of bronze that must be so hard to do
879785,"no, the reason you will never buy this game is because you're probably the type to not get sucked into the hype and let the stupids like me guinea pig new games for you fuck you and your responsible money management"
879843,but...but... you forgot minecraft
879879,because this community hates curse more than anything because we are obviously the devil reincarnated...
879890,remove fifflaren remove fifflaren you are worst support etc
879891,"but na lcs is happening now, who cares about some silly servers on the other side of the ocean!"
879960,yes bullying small publishers and developers is exactly what sony should be doing
879979,don't worry guys he is not a troll
879985,finally they are moving it back to open beta for testing!
880008,so he is going to join my bronze v team
880025,omg no one has every gotten annoyed at teamates on league :o
880050,because free health on a tank champion that will always build mana anyways is bad right?
880064,if you imagine them all with jack black 's voice it gets better...
880078,"yeah, because all them indie games are real console sellers"
880081,now we wait for the tl;dr pa- it's already up.
880099,"you're right, maybe they'll totally scrap it."
880116,i have offered 900 on it so i hope it isnt 300
880122,"but watch out, ubisoft's supreme uplay drm system will stop you while never inconveniencing their actual customers."
880124,alabama is so backwards that they just discovered sims 2.
880125,"change his abilities to a jump kind of thing fir his q, an aoe slow for his w and an attack steroid for his e. then add a skillshot for his ult."
880126,so you can tell that you're playing on xbox and not pc.
880156,why would you need sound proof booths when you can have helicopter headphones?
880195,but the human eye can't see above 30
880196,"yeah, cdp barely knows how to make rpgs and cyberpunk is such a shit theme"
880201,because finding something not as funny as others directly correlates with ones opinion on their on how funny one is
880223,"oh god the horror, he showed emotions other then joy, must be a terrible fucking person"
880245,bro you have no idea what you're typing
880280,yes i need to know who's bronze in my team so i can blame them in case i am confused on how i lost.
880302,yeah because that happens so often right?
880313,and we should inconvenience them by cutting off their dicks!
880357,"their reason could be retaining morals, or customer satisfaction... no, that's just ludicrous."
880358,and obviously there is *nothing* in your life that others would judge as being a waste.
880366,yeah i bet xbone will pass the wii u when smash comes out.
880370,jeez how dare monte take some time to defend himself from reginalds accusations
880390,"230 hours and 47 wins, sem ;) so salty!"
880402,i really miss those level 2 ganks top!
880418,confirmed: clg hooker as a new (moral) support
880451,i think a molotov cocktail through their window would do pretty nicely.
880465,note: source = someone said so.
880522,thanks for the spoilers in the title!
880642,"and cant forget that schedule 1 killer drug, marijuana."
880758,"yes, let's destroy the growing infant economy of cs:go."
880912,there's no girls on the internet silly.
880924,telling people in an obscure reddit thread sure seems like the correct way about getting your opinion heard.
880969,literally unplayable i want my 450 ip back.
881006,"damn, so you're saying its gonna be a pretty short game?"
881010,"because, y'know, japan has an army.."
881042,lololllolol old release xin can beat him easy
881063,yeah they can't check a database or anything
881065,don't you like some doritos or mtn dew?
881069,wow great idea no one has ever thought of it before i bet blizzard will like it.
881108,and this topic is never posted and riot has no idea it's a problem
881146,now we just need a glowing hp-bar when a buff is smiteable.
881155,"at riot games, we believe relying on crits will seperate the good adcs from the great ones."
881160,watch it guys we have a badass over here
881163,because everyone knows that people only play **one** game until they 100% it and then calmly go out and then make another selection.
881172,like those ogn nabs know how to play!
881198,what if i want that cinematic feel?
881209,"hopefully, it will be as good as the avatar movie !"
881240,ya that's clearly the difference between good and bad engineers
881252,"yeah, this is definitely a dealbreaker for me, uninstalling right now."
881345,surely we can see how successful past hyper-competitively designed games have been competitively.
881364,i think whatever riot tells me to think.
881383,but why do people on here argue then ?
881400,fucking casual mario games and there lack of physics
881410,because this didn't already exist in 1.7.
881468,"just a quick back ground as a basic template, needed a place to adhere a item frame, so made a back ground, and boom the shrine was done."
881469,"i could be d1 but it's the feeder noobs that hold me back, 1v1 me boxbox"
881485,yes south korea has the most school shootings a year
881490,it took me 7 promos to get into plat 5 because the plat noobs didnt let me in!
881506,what you mean that 2 page piece of paper that has the controls and legal notices and nothing else?
881514,"yeah, let us exclude all the polish, french, spanish, italian, etc players who do not speak english while playing as well while we are at it."
881536,"nah, only someone like elon musk or bill gates is capable of wanting that."
881627,shh don't tell anyone its a secret
881635,yeah im pretty sure you're the only one who thinks that.
881650,"wow integrated twitch support, colour me impressed m$!"
881701,there is literally over a dozen easy hotfixes and additions to the game that could be made to increase the new player experience and the most seasoned veteran but you have to remember that takes money and riot doesn't make much money..
881721,"oh, i guess because it's a 750 skin they have an excuse to not do the simplest of things."
881726,yeah and not the gtav subreddit where this belong!
881734,"how dare you insult the amazing level of acting that tsm performs at, you are a horrible person"
881783,how else am i supposed to easily know when people are watching netflix?
881802,should've written fragile on the box
881811,"kay guys, tencic called its over lets end this esports thing"
881817,downvoted b/c and impact lucked dyrus noob 2v1
881835,so many adc's to choose from in this meta.
881841,"no, they are going to send you to jail for 15 years if you use it."
881870,"finished my minecraft castle yes, of course there will be *other* games on a minecraft subreddit!"
881921,"just what wow needs, more 9 year olds..."
882048,totally because eu and korea and china and brazil and my elbow are all better than na
882081,it has been spoken: riot dislikes fun.
882111,because ww2 is the only war we acknowledge.
882187,assassin type of champion against kayle sounds like a great idea.
882234,just buy another year of xbox live gold and the problem will go away.
882290,"of course not, they're done with roman numerals."
882311,i love how people don't abuse it and play carry support
882370,i'm just glad they crushed akali and shaco in the process.
882379,oh no what ever will tsm do without their shot caller
882387,"nonono, it was the awesome itembuild who did it ;)"
882395,"yes, commander mode and a scripted levolution every map is worth the money."
882397,i can't wait to get nothing but dreamhack mp7s and augs from these crates.
882437,"no, i'm pretty sure it's 2 get buy 1."
882460,"yes, because battlefield in known for it's riveting and complex story telling"
882486,how can you beta test when you can't spell?
882510,that is exactly what optic is still.
882554,the human eye can't see under 50ms
882601,not enough mlg/nostalgia/.
882612,"you're right, it's totally impossible to convey sarcasm through text..."
884002,"even though its never revealed he is gay, he is definitely gay for being a male hairdresser right?"
884143,yeah phil jackson never played basketball professionally so that's why he was a terrible nba coach.
884283,"yes, there will be millions of new subscribers because of an npc."
884366,"yeah, that's why she's instaban/pick in lcs"
884378,yeah because eu will have to stop importing talent from other regions now.
884422,"thank riot for keeping the competition intense in na/eu,"
884709,"yes, because warlocks get shafted in the cool looking gear department."
884724,"nonono, your missing the point too core items = late game, usually youll start roaming csing in lane = mid game, dont have more than a dorans usually walking to lane = laning phase, thats why they call it *laning* phase, duh"
884939,"because it's so hard to gapclose as yasuo, even though your ult has a pretty low cooldown and you have your e..."
885141,what are you talking about who doesn't have a massive tattoo on their neck?
885192,"yeah, i really think had tsm given the ad boosted tristana's lane a free tower, an even easier shutdown on ryze, a free dragon, then the ability to rotate top with a gold advantage, they would have had that game in the bag!"
885219,5 mins of lomo cat and 3 with the majority of travis doing the talking... quality content
885302,i think you meant to say who *wouldn't* buy this?
885317,kelby wasnt real manager he did nothing best he stepped down
885360,because the people who work on aesthetics for the game are the same ones that work on the client and servers.
885380,make it shorter by ~20 seconds and it will be perfect
885411,i reached challenger in 20 games but my account got hacked so i have to play on my silver smurf that i can't carry to challenger because of shitty teammates
885500,i always thought nether was short for netherlands.
885560,tb is irrelevant if we consider what the *'gaming press'* says about him.
885587,this is the type of content that ruins subreddits!
885694,"if you can't beat a player through gameplay, talk shit and talk down!"
885716,yes that is why amumu is top pick at worlds
885782,because ps4 is holding us back
885871,now that it's not with ongamers clearly they can do it now
885891,nah just a redditor with the clg flair
885893,who needs new champions and new skins when we got esports
885903,i know my fellow edt friends are chomping at the bit to preorder so they can play at 3am.
886018,they are totally bffs thats why lewis broke the loss of the analyst role for thoorin in poland
886035,"no way, i thought he was really saying his azir was bugged and dealt less damage!"
886122,wanting a console for whatever reason is stupid.
886131,because in ranked they're all the best and going to be the next trick2g.
886172,well this guy said it so it must be true
886216,man people would go crazy here if someone like qtie said the same bjergsen did.
886236,"wow, i'm worried about running far cry 4 then, i only have an overclocked his 290x."
886245,"sure that rain looks nice, but how long before those weather effects are actually patched in?"
886295,"idk could just be a bad game, like some serious tilt or something..."
886302,"it would help someone live for another .035 seconds, obviously!"
886359,"oh, them finishing 5-6th 3 out of 4 times instead of 4 out of 4 really changes the whole thing."
886389,just your casual everyday chance shot
886396,they could totally beat ssw if they had gleeb
886398,"1080p is pointless 720p just looks as good, you can't tell the difference anyways unless you are playing on a 1000 inch screen."
886403,"yeah, clg will benefit a lot with that."
886405,"hmm i too, have never seen doublelift carry a game."
886441,don't you know that having a penis makes you a narcissistic monster resistant to all problems?
886566,why don't we go out and manufacture merchandise for all 119 champions so everyone can buy something of their main...
886635,yeah cod bf3 all the waaay omg you dont even need to aim in this game wtf and look at the comic grafic wtfff
886639,real hard when you have no rotation rate.
886652,i'll be missing all the features we have on our current client
886765,i'm *sure* that's worse than my vandal brand skin i got off of mystery gifts.
886894,i'm amazed so many people made accounts to specifically say how awesome this video was
886930,irregardless* god you really aren't a smart man.
886997,"oh look, a lee sin making killing someone, what a rare sight."
887004,ofc noone other than koreans can play xerath well... na and eu pro players' xerath is korean bronze v standard
887011,release xin zhao is indeed nothing compared to lucian these days
887048,i bet all the tsm fans would enjoy that
887078,because being pissed off and being amenable to a fan request are clearly similar
887083,"wow thanks, i hadnt noticed, excellent find op!"
887127,"yeah, because an-94 is a weapon created solely to be only in battlefield."
887194,"thanks for sharing this problem with us, we never heard of it"
887259,but come on guys this game is so weird and wacky goty 2014.
887283,"wait, so you're saying that people who aren't good at videogames aren't all mentaly and/or physically challenged?"
887311,"doesnt matter, op found a way to fix his problem."
887331,"nintendo may still be behind the times when it comes to many online aspects, but at least they've caught up with pre-order exclusives!"
887364,because they could fake it like the moon landing?
887371,but siv hd builds 6 roas on leblanc!
887393,"*yup only microsoft* is doing it, *no chance of any other company like sony doing it too*"
887432,yup because you know everything about me from reddit.
887441,"oh you lost a game, guess you're the first one too lose a game"
887442,"yes he will, my dad works at riot"
887443,so ya thinking of getting mcc digital or physical?
887480,"if it's an open world rpg, you better believe it was based around the model of skyrim."
887509,i bet this is why she needs feminism
887525,"well, he's not driving a *tank*, is he?"
887543,"it's okay, they have a higher ratio of korean and european to american players so they'll be fine."
887548,yup he's just going to spend 3k while taking a break from college and streaming to travel to korea alone
887549,"yeah man, links definitely the best all-round player as we have seen by his absolutely amazing ad carry, top and support play."
887580,so did you go from bronze to challenger or challenger to bronze?
887629,"also, walls are coded as minions."
887637,because his rank totally makes his opinion invalid.
887642,-scrubs -leet pros (me) -cheaters
887660,"yes i agree, the beta we got perfectly illustrates that the full game won't have much content."
887679,"lol, yep once we get our hands on guns we just can't help ourselves but go on killing sprees and joyrides."
887689,"0x so, you are saying you two have no lives."
887751,i thought this would never be suggested if it does get implemented i get to bm more
887759,no man you gotta be sensitive and agree even if you think it's retarded
887782,"oh give them a break, i bet this was going to be unique and totally different than the other hundreds of mmos out there"
887844,yes just like everyone in america is an obese gun-toting red neck...
887898,its almost like its his job or something...
887947,this nerf will separate the good pantheons from the bad pantheons.
887976,it's funny because they're younger
887977,"yeah, because high school when you are 13 years old really takes it out of you."
888013,i used to be a reddit user like you...
888046,this was worth creating a topic and posting.
888058,woah now let's not be hasty here... don't want to get too drastic
888071,"definitely needed, after all we don't have any other bugs or projects the devs are working on."
888088,thanks for pointing out the flaws of my comment rather than just dismissing it with this makes no sense
888097,"dont you know ea is supposed to put out games for free and endless dlc for free which should also be in the game already and developers and testers and artists should all work for free and live off the warm fuzzies gamers get from the aaa title that cost thousands upon thousands of dollars to produce, but it should also be 100% bug free."
888151,"yeah i agree, every pro player should say wow this guy is playing amazing!"
888154,bigotry doesnt exist anywhere else.
888193,yeah because not showing the range of an ability and having you guess/learn it is the absolute peak of technical skill.
888225,god i love looking at skins that took a minute to put together.
888243,i don't know guys i like my games at a cinematic 30fps and a smooth 720p
888252,gee i have never heard a game company deny a project they were actually working on...
888276,yeah dyrus posting a single joke sure derails the entire discussion
888280,"no, when you die to the enemy you must go all in once you come back to lane to have revenge."
888281,"you spam other people's profiles with huge ascii thumbs up valve please add this, then link your own skin."
888294,"yeah, at least activision cares about the community and allows us to buy overpriced map packs and gold deags."
888299,but don't hotshot and saint have a great relationship since they were on the same team for so long?
888309,"yeah, sorry voidle, you might be the best support in the eucs, but 12.5 kda is too low for what we're aiming for, you're out - nip 2014"
888328,"that's why teemo is always pick/ban in lcs, right?"
888332,this is so unimpressive i do this 69 times every game.
888343,"yep, because people only ever bought shurelias for the hp."
888348,your right these console game developers have been using this shit for years
888356,"pfft, everyone knows you have to upgrade a pc once every 3 months."
888361,"obviously matchmaking for teaming him with retards, how can you possibly not flame when your team is feeding"
888409,"you need to set permissions to do it, try making sure you have read and write privileges!"
888452,and those people totally read this post
888498,i wasn't aware courtney love had so much to say about the gaming industry
888513,"nah, but it should be because thats how it is in real life brah"
888655,"yeah but games are like, exclusive to consoles."
888661,yeah because people helping someone in need is a bad thing and you shouldn't raise awareness for it.
888698,aw man i hate ea games i haven't bought an ea game since titanfall.
888702,hahaha yo this comment is original good stuff!
888713,i'm poor so everyone else is too
888739,"if the charity was for selfish reasons, all the good things it did mean nothing."
888799,i just preordered one because i'm an edgy contrarian like that.
888802,"dlc...lolz... new act new class new npc crafter new way to play the game 10 new levels, with new abilities for all existing classes yeah...this clearly isn't worth any cash."
888804,who doesn't want to hire a group of script kiddies that can ddos?
888813,yep that must've been the random pick order for sure
888842,i had promote and i promoted my sight

889378,yes a diamond-challenger smurf...ive never seen that before
889398,"i'm not picking up a wii u unless it can play every game ever, costs $2, and comes with 5 controllers cupholders."
889408,lol newfag casual doesn't recognize redditors by name
889421,"well, since top lane is exactly the same it was in s3, i guess we better not ask really good top laners for advise when we get the chance!"
889519,"yeah, because nobody ever pirated gta v for their ps3 or xbox"
889576,guys i believe this guy with 0 proof of working in riot or even in esports he must surely be right!
889597,yeah because baron debuff didnt really matter in this circumstance
889601,"ahh, we don have to remember 300 numbers anymore but have to writte 3 more letters and press tab, sooo bad."
889619,what about the masterpiece that is snake's revenge?
889675,just tell steam support that he learned his lesson and they should give his items back
889755,a rare opportunity to go outside into the world and enjoy fresh air.
889989,"sorry, but you aren't korean so it isn't impressive at all."
890107,"considering january 10th is my birthday, and nothing good happens on my birthday, i'm going to assume very little."
890469,"but bro, the sectors write faster if they are set to ff first."
890652,"yeah because a diamond 1 adc and a 1200 lp challenger adc are the same thing, right?"
890752,"you should main champions that provide great teamplay such as master yi, tryndamere, fizz, shaco, vayne, katarina, lee sin, rengar, riven, etc."
890997,"well ubisoft doesnt make sure that their games work on every pc, or any for that matter, so what's the difference"
891042,"be careful, or 'lord' monte is gonna go muay thai on ur ass"
891149,shits fucked boys ^^^
891161,are you willing to give up a raid tier for this?
891310,"but they're just avrage gamer gals, right?"
891311,"yah, it was totally unplayable offline, remember?"
891340,man i'm so jealous i'm gonna go buy a vita and boost the sales by 100% now.
891489,"kill cat, get tail, brew tail, creeper repellent potion."
891621,thank god we have people like you around who love hyperbole and don't know proper use of the word literally nice constructive comment by the way.
891735,"pfft, i only listen to real rap like eminem, not justin gayber."
891765,me think this is right place it
891822,but they'll remove just about anything triggering it at least!
891844,but then how is the youtuber supposed to gain money through monetization?
891875,it's almost like it's not done and they are just testing it on the pbe
892043,nah counterplay for adcs means that they should be able to 1v1 an assassin.
892090,no just look at other sports there are no successful stars who are dedicated to winning but assholeish and arrogant.
892129,this is why video games are evil and need to be banned
892179,yea his english has improved so much too
892260,"hair stays perfect in pouring rain, 2/10 next gen sucks"
892262,i hope my computer doesn't require much of a hardware update to allow me to fly through the clouds
892292,or his jeans are too wide and he has to hold them some times (happens to me every now and then)
892299,i don't play this champ at all xd
892413,"nice novelty account, you're hilariious"
892448,"yeah, those huge and lively towns in skyrim was truly rich in details"
892458,are you sure you don't want to take a minute and think about it though?
892574,wow 20.000 so much money for fnatic
892602,"this is a great idea, after 4 years this is the very first person to ever post this wonderful idea"
892632,the downvote being used for its real purpose right here.
892633,yeah because having an extra stat on boots would totally nerf pd.
892671,because ssw totally had a close group
892715,typical response from a filthy casual.
892749,475 range yasuo q 1150 ezreal q they should both crit
892760,"no, this one resets the stability to that of a bear on ice skates on razer blades."
892795,yeah keyboard and mouse is great for racing games!
892859,he made the team look bad so it is only logical to bench him.
892868,yes because win/loss ratio is a perfect indicator whether or not someone belongs in that league
892879,that's definitely the same thing
892983,but a few people on here assured me this like never happens.
893032,"before his nerf his winrate was 47%, already pretty low, but because he has the potential to outplay you he must be op"
893036,"probably, anything above 24 fps is a waste"
893038,are there any ps4 games besides this that aren't ps3 remakes?
893040,clearly yasuo is underpowered and needs massive buffs
893073,"yeah twitch does it because they love esports, they aint about money"
893078,omg syndra so easy it's only two skillshots for her stun i just roll my face on the keyboard
893220,hurr durr but they remade the game after titanfall came out!
893224,but is it 1080p 60fps cuz thats what matters this generation
893356,yea adding variety to a game is terrible for the longevity of the game
893383,dude they are both fat and asian they could basically be identical twins!
893413,"nah man, paying 1200 for a 600 pc is not a waste of money"
893426,ok... i can't believe they are printing discs for a game that is coming out in a couple weeks!
893459,"that's the same title they told me to use, too!"
893480,til that old games are automatically bad.
893541,well gee i wonder why you didn't have the problem
893591,instead of fixing the broken servers rito should be redesigning the client
893664,it's almost as if the developers cater to the end users :o
893671,"yes, because we all know how stupidly op the high tier russians are..."
893688,"nah, but try the cassiopeia bot script ;-)"
893748,no you can't nerf lee sin he's the most balanced champion in the game
893749,"what a fucking asshole, i mean he told us someone won the game, so many spoilers"
893782,"ah yes, just because you aren't dealing with horrible lag means that everyone else is absolutely blowing things out of proportion and lying and nobody else has any troubles at all ever."
893867,"keep complaining, riot certainly have shown they give many fucks before!"
893898,you sound like a fun guy to be at a party with
893904,i'm so glad the community can get behind something like trolling people who've done nothing to you.
893907,no you are just a piece of shit pro90 user.
893931,"yes, he'll be useless in a meta where tf is thriving"
893948,so... does this mean riot likes gambit...?
893977,"silver ii reporting in, you're clearly hacking."
894003,"obviously fake, didn't wind wall."
894016,wait... there are other cities?
894062,get wh to rank up and be able to ban those nasty hackers!
894091,wooow you're sooo cool
894094,"obviously he is a fan of real madrid attacking trio of benzema, bale and cristiano ronaldo"
894096,i've never played halo 4 and was planning to play it this month... thanks guys
894097,not first ed shadowless..casual...
894105,"cool, didn't know a gpu was a complete all in one system."
894107,because the raids aren't up in the beta.
894128,but my funy le maymay nestalgia :(((
894136,"yes, because tes online is such a great and extensive game."
894139,but what about that vayne play he did 2 years ago
894188,"listen to live unmuted streams with turbo, now just $15/mo !"
894193,"is it only me but i havent heard any news lately on lmq, maybe this is the savior they need."
894196,"wow, i didn't know they founded a religion!"
894198,"xm1016 is the updated version of xm1014 which they added in the new dlc , right?"
894231,oh qtpie is mechanically a genius
894234,"yeah, how unrealistic to assume that the top2 eu team that always placed higher than a slumping top5 na team would win"
894259,not since class homogenization...
894262,lets face the facts this post pretty much ruined the sub.
894263,try my ad jungle garen build and tell me i dont need mechanics
894296,"but i am better than them, so i need to talk yes?"
894336,woah watch out we got a badass over here.
894358,"lol that sure told me, i deff don't think you're a whiny bitch anymore"
894364,yeah they buffed his q cool down and he e shreds more armor
894376,i don't know anyone who *doesn't* own a brick house with white roofs!
894377,ikr i fucking hate it when someone buys csgo on sale yesterday and played the game for 812 hours straight
894394,"no way, absolutely no one cares why these issues are happening"
894454,riot is doing a great job on hyping up regionals.
894472,i see no bias in your statement at all
894475,pop punk is a pronoun used for that.
894478,"got played in lcs and won, nerfs incoming"
894483,"can only attack and parry in four different directions, just like everyone else?"
894500,just remember that zoe quinn and her sjw goons are perfect little snowflakes and they would never do something like this.
894546,now i won't get reported for building it on udyr!
894565,i can't imagine why you had a shortage of raiders...
894600,"saying regi is throwing shit around implying he's a monkey implying something about race, lynch him now!"
894607,"well duh, you don't get more anime than mario."
894643,i bet you're really good at this game.
894660,you need the component cables for that.
894666,"yes man tribunal is down so cant get punished, also if they pick your lane tell them you duo mid np."
894667,"i would complain too if i got 2 free xbox dev kits, a free copy of unity and access to the unreal engine."
894723,making snarky comments automatically gets him to top tier.
894725,i take it you're a jungle main.
894731,"don't you dare say anything about the format, it's obvious that we have the single best possible showdown, since 50%+1 of the voters voted for these 10 picks."
894732,"seriously, i can't wait for the front page to be half filled riot plz posts again."
894740,why learn two pistols when all you need is p250?
894852,"it's okay, we cant see past 30fps anyway"
894919,because they will obviously be the same thing after buyout.
894982,he's subtlety saying the game is a piece of shit.
895117,"you don't deserve to be plat though, someone must have duo'd you there."
895158,yeah lemon also known for missing all his bindings
895181,"oh god, the wii u is so expensive compared to my pc."
895201,so people in lcs/ogn clearly don't know what they are doing when they rush athene's on tf right?
895202,im pretty sure they steal some lines from players who write poems for the little extra rp and take credit for it.
895203,what kind of fuckin loser would watch people kick a ball for an enternity instead of watching some quality lol action?
895204,no because we can't let xbone win anything because this is the internet.
895297,so thats why i get 10 fps in inferno
895324,i too have a pink pony dancing around on my wow ui
895369,based on the wonderful citation you presented backing up the claim that people (even the most hardcore of gamers) are spending more time on apps than games.
895406,"it's named after a ps controller, so you know it must be a biased fan site."
895419,"if you rage hard enough, people would get better in-game!"
895458,"remember, riot is not enforcing a meta!"
895495,i had such high hopes for ride to hell retribution too
895531,lords of the flys is a great children's book.
895533,"well, the ps4 isn't as broken as the xbox one so it doesnt need updating."
895602,and the bomb making materials that i'm told the nsa keeps trying to see with my kinect
895620,"but all this free work will look so good in my portfolio, it will also be a beautiful experience and perhaps they will put a good word for me when the time comes."
895626,"hey, we could do that in 1988 in ultima v. catch up, modern games!"
895640,"it looks like you're focusing the boss, you should kill the adds."
895654,"yes, and i thought i was the only one playing renekton top."
895668,haha cause fuck bronze baddies amirite?
895744,"yeah, shiphtur and link are trash."
895745,"yes, because 100% of the us population wanted to go to war in iraq/afghanistan"
895778,red alert was the best game ever.
895792,"yep, completely, only one in the whole universe"
895801,but dominion is just a brainless deathmatch!

896073,hahahah kk so froggen looks like a dinosaur so obviously he's wrong
896078,"he's probably got a great attitude, though."
896080,"seriously, my controller is still in its original packaging... wtf are you guys doing with your controllers..."
896128,"very true, hence why dota2 also charges out their asses for champions and runes..."
896152,i am silver though i should be challenger...or at least diamond.
896200,"as a blaine, i certainly haven't heard that one before."
896227,"why would we fix kassadin, he is banned all time anyway"
896242,but you can just see and feel the hatred between the 2 from a video
896295,i sure do wish i lived in kiev still instead of my calm suburban town with my girlfriend.
896352,but i dont wanna work for it blizz pls

896582,"poor vince has said no at least 1,000 times today"

897498,i like to see that glow when the frozen fist is waiting to proc.. so clear
897554,"yeah, because you're the only one here that can think up threads like this..."
897638,ps4 doesn't have a working online service either
898157,"true, even without it, it should be obvious, but it does kind of work the same way as"
898216,swift found out cj was keeping space for another year so he jumped ship
898272,those must be some really good headphones.
898320,because 1v1s always determine who is better at league
898321,"that's what separate's the good veigars from the best veigars, the ability to last hit with a autoattack mechanic that's different from all his other skins."
898413,vaguely grass-related texture is too taxing.
898569,yup.. good thing i was playing a ranked game.

899289,"havent seen this thread in the last 12 hours, so i will upvote it for visibilty"
899351,your uncle might be racist too.
899412,"just let them troll, report and hope riot perma ban them"
899497,"you're from latin america, obviously you must be connected to some cartel."
899513,"no, we have to roll our face on the q w e r and 1 2 buttons aswell."
899667,yes because everyone would rather play the team favor'd to win worlds in the quarters
899677,"all while you sit around completely helplessly because of tristana's passive that makes it so you can't move or use any abilities, dumb champ please nerf."
899725,this is why goldenglue was benched
899756,"yeah, all these smurfs keeping you in bronze."
899797,"human eye can only see 30 fps, you dont need more than 30 fps"

900040,in the future there's a 31st month!
900046,and i got perma'd for having 30 secs of dc !
900062,yes because i'm sure so many cs players read chinese/japanese to even be distracted in the first place...
900087,'a bunch of men ridiculing a woman trying to break the glass ceiling!'
900088,are you kidding me man my whole night was riding on this

900635,"yeah because all these guys from balance team, champion designers, 3d and splash artists are gonna do such a great job when put to work on bugfixing, optimizing engine and debugging"
900647,"this is reddit, take your reason and objectivity somewhere else scrub."
900686,i 1v1'd heaton with just a pistol and he had ak and i won :^)
900724,but dude link and seraph are toxic!
900771,"remember, if its not oppressing black people, its not racism."
900841,no that 1k dollar pc wont bring you any performance improvements
900897,but 10% cdr totally makes the difference!
900901,fuck you for giving that person a complement (downvotes)
900913,"no, 100% of redditors here are challenger/bronze 5 kr."
901007,"gee, that sounds like *so much fun*."
901029,"it's so hard to make those little rooms when the players are isolated from noise like in mlg, huh riot?"
901038,you just gotta wonder how advanced blenders are these days...
901043,"yeah he changed and will never post nude pics of underage females again, fucking hire him!"
901085,yea because obviously patch rundowns made by the company that makes the changes will not be biased at all
901086,"riot is doing with lol exactly what blizzard did with wow and what ultimately made me quit, which is dumbing down the game in order to cater to lower tier players gj rito"
901247,because google is known improving video services.
901261,"yes they need to be fined for buying stack items when they are snowballing out of control, that's not the purpose of these items at all."
901272,when has ea ever mangled an ip?
901290,i hope someone was fired for that serious lore mistake.
901299,"also, don't play competetive if: you want to have fun."
901351,"a blonde guy in a white suit, and their sexualities are both in question good find op"
901368,cyanide please brush your teeth
901383,"yeah let's not let the players have time to set up their equipment in game settings to how they play at home, make them all play on default settings with riot supplied keyboard and mouse right?"
901386,"dude that's like 4 hours wasted, god how unprofessional ggwp clg relegated"
901433,"yep, he's disabled in the lcs cause he's balanced."
901439,"yeah, and tristana's jump doing damage when it lands is stupid"
901453,how else would we know she's a protagonist?
901511,thanks for your relevant and informative comment!
901573,yeah sony definitely decided to do it just because microsoft did it.
901623,"but 24fps is better, cinematic experience."
901661,but the 24 fps cinematic feel is obviously much better
901690,"yeah, because he got banned while trying to teach people not to troll and flame."
901701,"yea, pushing people into saftey sounds like a ability"
901717,"i treat strangers like friends, this is totally the reason why i type gg easy at the end."
901718,yeah dude you totally showed him whos boss
901784,but what if they did everything that was in the poll before the release and that poll was just a distraction?
901792,yeah i hate paying 60 dollars to play 300+ hours of just multi-player like bf4 or cod.
901830,"nah, they can hire dlift for his amazing intuition on theorycrafting and balancing."
901843,just be happy a free game is giving you anything hur hurrr
901862,report bronze noob only 4kcs 601 mins
901880,"you made it to the 3rd boss, what seems to be the problem?"
901944,the quality of reworks is just incredible.
902005,"damn, too bad i already traded in my copy."
902018,"15% chance of failing animation, -5hp when you fail"
902032,you sound like the technical type who understands how to implement large industrial network infrastructure on a global scale.
902057,yes segmentation is a great answer
902059,yeah...just take your high end pcs and go fuck yourself
902068,b-b-b-but... people can't see past two dimensions anyway!
902148,"also, crouched shots, what is this skyrim?"
902157,"could've at least scheduled for flowers to be delivered before he kicked the bucket, how inconsiderate"
902161,"but malzahar is a champion that is fun to play against, with no frustrating gameplay elements like inescapable voidlings (you can't control who they attack, we can't do anything except watch you hold that passive charge and outtrade us as your e pushes the wave), 3-second long cc, or afk pushing."
902268,"they should stop watching got and improve their map awareness, those little piece of shit!"
902282,"yes right, a qol buff will make darius go from being kited every teamfight to pentakilling if not focused by the whole team..."
902285,of course all the minions are manually controlled too.
902292,"you should be tsm's coach, not regi"
902325,"this is so microsoft can stand on that stage, crow about how they listened to their fans (this company has never once listened to its fans, nor have they ever exhibited even the slightest ounce of interest in catering to the consumer, but whatever) yeah, because the drm 180 and constant stream of console updates giving us fan requested features means nothing..."
902329,"yes that is my point exactly, congratulations."
902332,"man, those dps need to step it up."
902337,boobzz or riot kappa kappaaa.
902338,"oh, thank you so much for that, i almost forgot"
902357,once the finish red dead redemption first...
902391,"hey, he posted bug numbers and fancy words, it must be right!"
902405,"jokes on you, the human eye can only see at 30 fps!"
902436,sorry the small developer doesn't want to give away their game for free
902438,its enchanted crystal arrow not physical crystal arrow.
902443,"thanks, i was just thinking hey i haven't seen that trade gif in almost a week, i hope it gets reposted again!"
902461,"no, all support mains are angels, just look at the front page once a week!"
902520,"blatant racism by riot, just because lucian is black does not mean he isn't human."
902533,"yes, because the last few skate games were just so awesome."
902541,whoa you got the joke good job man
902545,no one's ever complained about dota's spawn timer for jungle mobs.
902593,you sound like such a nice person i would love to play with ingame
902722,except keeping the same games for the same price on a wii when the wiiu came out...who wouldn't pay $50 for a 3 year old game?
902752,and the circlejerk about circlejerk begins ...thanks for your insightful post op
902753,"because mundo and shyvana are sooo fun to play, amarite ?"
902772,"yeah, jeeze why would you come to a place you can almost guarantee everyone attending the event frequents regularily to ask for help."
902864,or just call a do-over at this point
902870,"yeah, i mean nerfing a perfectly balanced champion like gragas would be totally unfair"
902932,"i only have opinions because game companies planted them in my head, so it's their fault."
902935,for being forced to buy titanfall duh!
902966,it's like he's never even heard someone speak asian.
903017,omg i can't build pc i don't have soldering iron!
903028,and get alliance an extra boost in av since they cant win!
903031,"yea, everyone knows they can just easily fire art people and just shit out some smart people to easily fix this problem"
903081,what the fuck is the last guardian?
903082,"looking at it closely, i can see its photoshopped."
903102,its almost as if different people have different opinions look at me i'm so witty and smarter than all the other redditors huehuehuehue
903130,"you're right, i'd rather play a new cod every year than a new smash brothers every four or five."
903140,yep hopefully they slowly rework every champion to be so weak it'll be an arena of pool noodles and nerf guns
903143,"it's actually my n00b team, if i didn't have my n00b feeding team (or if i tried) i'd be challenger"
903144,"also telling you they don't have a low cooldown, 2 seconds is really long when defending a turret."
903151,ya that single play is definitely the sole reason for riot nerfing grag.
903177,yea because having game turns is a bad thing
903217,because his trash talk was so serious.
903227,you understood everything that i wrote.
903261,"wow, because bjergsen never trolls his stream on purpose!"
903262,no it's supposed to be like this.
903268,"yes, jax needs quality of life buffs desperately to be playable!"
903353,"ah, so you are saying that unlike virtually every other optical media, ps1 game discs don't have a uuid (media id) which allows to uniquely identify each disc?"
903392,yeah just send me your credit card number and i will send the money right to you ;)
903393,"yeah bro, no one was looking so it was still morally okay."
903394,"oddone just had an amazing performance with trundle in top lane, i'd like an ama too, to ask him why he left tsm for c9 eu."
903477,"alright qazzy, i think we've had enough of your advertisement for today!"
903549,that was very golden rule of you.
903620,"sadly yes, the second half was slapped together due to it's staff and budget got stolen by final fantasy 8 good decision on their part"
903625,i can't wait to play through all these zelda style puzzles in ds2 that i've been hearing about.
903669,"probably not, and he should not have to, it's riot's fault."
903674,0/10 not made with iron blocks.
903698,you must be fun to hang out with
903726,"oh no, this is the internet, where some people like cod, day 1 dlc is in there to make sure you are a loyal cod fan, not to rip you off."
903776,thanks internet for choosing a disc-based future
903841,"come on, man, we could should healing arrows at people!"
903883,"because they should definitely update pictures every time a new console comes out, regardless if the style of the stand stays the same."
903890,its going to be a new boktai game!
903931,"sources are furousfanboys and jeremey conrad, two of the most unbiased people in all of gaming"
904857,yeah can't you see all the places it rhymed 'axe' with 'axe'
904899,"yeah, because adjusting the brightness is *hard*."
905034,i should be in challenger by now but the system put me in bronze 5.
905074,"fire more powerful arrows, more efficiently, while using them to block projectiles, duh."
905188,yea those items give 0 stats until finished
905236,because everything that isn't american is wrong.
905311,if only we knew of such a game being developed right now *sigh*
905761,riot has their priorities straight
905807,and made sure to post about it before/after the fact on a massive public forum.
906003,"yes, i'm color blind and can only see in black/white"
906021,because of my personal preference?
906133,"... yes, trying to run a nice server where nobody is hacked is a really asshole thing to do."
906177,so you are telling me that al qaeda wasn't created over call of duty?
906199,"yeah, aoe cc is so difficult to land."
906220,because rockstar can't afford it
906247,"sorry, what has this got to do with gta 5?"
906448,"oh thanks, without you i would have never seen it op!"
906460,"yeah, how crazy is it for a company to change policies on something to make it more fair for new players after a year?"
906481,"from 512mb to 8gb... yup, not big at all!"
906514,"but this is s2 we're talking about, they have a *lot* more money than riot does."
906591,"no, we need constant updates of every single hacker in the game."
906728,"no, you can't admit they're even because only the losers say that."
906797,wow ps4 is clearly the winner of e3
906799,i spent a whole week making these memes i want my money and fame god damn it!
906830,it's almost like they're internationally releasing a gaming console or something!
906891,"but we are all diamond 1/ challenger, we clearly know more than riot because they totally don't know the grand scheme of things and we should replace them."
906979,"guys, karthus' passive gives him time after death to do cast and do damage, it doesn't even require work"
906991,he's being purposely ironic obviously...
907001,*half of his rp unless there is a way to magically get skins with ip now
907038,i'm glad we're at a point where gay rape is funny.
907068,yeah i mean if they really wanted to show they were true fans they would've said something about how they don't speak english!
907112,i'm not the op... i was pointing out the flaw is his failed attempt at faking a prank hence the ... perhaps next time i will type
907162,because a name as generic as raven rock can't have been used a million times allready.
907163,"yes, because warranty is tied through live accounts."
907217,we planted loads in the city to make up for it.. damn dirty hippies!
907221,because downvote accounts are ever so original.
907231,"great, another new thing that is destroying cs"
907248,yes because creating hype and chaos by getting people to skip school and take off work to buy and play their console/games would create such bad publicity...
907271,it **must** be one of those two!
907287,yes but you can buy all you need on the auction house and blizzard only gets 15%
907306,"no, nobody has ever thought that before."
907420,they're wearing suits in space *clearly* it must be halo.
907465,is it because they are difficult?
907497,i think he means just ii and iii--iv and vi don't even exist!
907522,sarcasm is extremely easy to detect on the internet.
907554,because we have a sword oath against starcraft 2
907560,"sure, 'cause youtube comments represent the only avenue of communication available to us in these dark ages."
907568,"ye, only in bronze, right, no way pro players would stack up in bushes and waste tp to get to lane"
907629,"oh, you're right, before every tournament they made sure to remark how they planned on doing ok."
907632,"yea, like smart ones gonna hack a giant software company like microsoft."
907644,unbelievable they might need an extra minute or so!
907651,and no company is known for marking things up based on hdd size
907652,how dare you not want the frontpage to be full of ps4 circlejerk!
907663,"yes, because m$'s profits are my greatest concern... thanks for easing my worries"
907677,"yeah then what microsoft, that's it, ps4 time."
907684,"yeah, because so many publishers drop playstation development since their games are given out with ps+."
907696,way to make claims without a source
907699,it's not a douche move to call someone out at all.
907703,i thought it was pretty [neato]
907753,"the target demographic doesn't have any irl friends, so no need to include a second controller."
907778,and riot never changes their mind
907811,better watch out for those summoners just waiting to use this exact comp against you over and over.
907814,ok i'll suck it up and go play the only other city simulator citiesxl
907861,$20 for 20+ hours of gameplay per dlc oh man what a waste of money
907929,does no one else realize its a joke calling out the guy who put the crisis 3 cd in his crisis 2 case...
907945,how else are you supposed to know she's female?
907955,"obviously you've never seen guyver 2, hayter shows such an amazing range as an actor in that film."
907960,"what, you mean all beginners don't get the master key, kill quelaag first, grab all the flame embers and kill the gargoyles with a +5 chaos blade?"
908018,"sorry for not having a view that confirms with the reddit hivemind, and i apologize if that annoys you"
908039,"it seems as if he is disappointed in something, but i cant figure out what?"
908101,what you're seeing is the immediate impending doom that the entire internet has predicted.
908136,"just because they won a bo5 against gg, doesn't mean they are solid"
908156,obviously the lighter weight makes it easier to aim.
908273,"i thought you meant strokes of a pen, to make art"
908276,"yes, that would certainly lead to a balanced and reasonable conclusion to the study."
908287,"yes it is, sorry i forgot to add"
908334,"seems legit, because you are only allowed to own one system - so rayman will not compete against gta for wii u user.."
908382,half life 3 not out by the end of 2013...thanks obama.
908400,luckily i learned with 2 level 30s guiding me so that way i didn't break the meta before level 10
908489,"omg elo hell holding me back from my true potential, invite me so i can show these noobs how its done!"
908494,damage hard counter to burst mage hue
908508,i just want a mod where i can breed dragons based on science and natural selection!
908532,yes that's much more clever than using a box.
908564,i definitely didn't see that one coming.
908579,i always thought it would look more like a creeper...but in real life.
908580,because a children's tv show presenter could totally take on a former sas trooper...
908581,"good, glad they finally patched him to be viable again."
908628,i think you're the first one to find this out...
908691,"silly primer, nobody plays games for the campaign anymore."
908755,pokemon black and white 2 is a lot like halo 4.
908789,"yea, same as da2 dumb user reviews, that game was amazing."
908817,dude that is genious did you come up with that?
908876,"yeah, heard that doesn't happen alot."
908931,"yup, everyone knows consoles make the best platforms for rtss."
908954,"world war 2, probably video games too."
908955,"yes, this seems like a perfectly fine and non-offensive thing to do."
908976,"yes, this is definitely not the case in any other countries."
908993,yeah openness and only one platform mix very good
909006,"they were clearly focusing the carry, they just happened to aoe all over the rest of the team"
909034,"not complete, we need brick, stone and sandstone logs to match the wood."
909045,"yea, why can't everyone just like what i like?"
909059,because you spend multiple hours in one game.
909061,badgets and trickets are useless without some l33t huge-ass banner showing them off in my forum sig
909129,like windows xp: lots of people still use it!
909143,gabe thought we'd never find out... clever bastard.
909158,hey man what about webos and blackberry?
909175,wow this totally sounds like a server i'd want to play on!
909204,"no, he is just being honest so that makes it alright."
909208,old people sure are wrong when they complain about young peoples' sense of entitlement.
909226,mine is inanimate and therefore incapable of expressing emotions.
909263,i usually hit the lock in button.
909305,oh no but i thought steam was infallible and perfect how can this be?
909351,"because sony's security is so tight, that ps3 games can't be pirated."
909392,what are you talking about dota 2 is still only in beta.
909439,"thanks, we all needed to know that."
909450,any reason why we have glass panes?
909453,why didn't you use spellcheck lol.
909454,"yes, you must be so incredibly popular with the ladies that you can afford to stop at meaningless details."
909472,"not only will it do that, it will also buy your dlc for you without you having to care, it's that much easier :d"
909474,"oh, i am so funny for saying something nobody actually thought of."
909516,oh man this will throw the balance of twisted treeline into a funk.
909549,whats the one made of obsidian?
909551,"yeah, i for one, take every opportunity to be extremely condescending with anyone who doesn't play the same video games as me."
909573,"come now, flash is a useless framework and should be stomped out."
909581,"dude, the reason he killed me 2 times and i have half his cs is because the jungler never ganks!"
909590,support indie developers...until they sell out!
909603,it is ***almost*** like they didn't test it on a variety of pc hardware or something... so unusual for games these days.
909618,"no it is cod, therefore it is bad"
909622,the resolution is too damn high.
909650,"yay, another mushroom-taking-over picture."
909682,someone should do a different one where the consoles are represented by disney princesses.
909707,"yup, only considered hardcore if you play cod."
909720,"it's not a bug, it's a feature so you can see if you bought the correct item or not."
909880,idiot is offensive to the stupid.
909944,i thought we all forgave ea because of the humble bundle.
910466,because i shot you first you noob!
910574,that sounds much easier than plugging a hdmi out cable into my phone.
910873,[fixed] psa: usb ports can charge usb devices
910982,yea and cloud 9 was undefeated and they made it so far into worlds
911205,"that is a really good argument sir, would you enlighten us idiots how you got to this realisation?"
911343,"yeah, that mod is particularly compatible with everything else."
911356,"yup, that sums up an entire community."
911578,"no i didnt novelty accounts are just retarded, haha his account is named cheeky bastard so he can make the same joke every time he sees that phrase from now on, hillarious."
911587,proof that 360 owners have more money than sense...
911601,"activision only cares about money, they don't give away free stuff like valve"
911633,hey man micro$oft needs more money so there needs to be more ads!
911680,best hackers don't need whois protection
911816,"yes, every criticism of the way things are implemented must mean that we hate the game and wish we had made it because then it would be better."
911827,yup just like all the people bashing last of us and bioshock infinite
911938,because there were no terrible games in the 90s.
912006,its obviously meant for killing minions thats why you do less dmg with it to champions.
912053,could one simply not obtain a driver's license and avoid all that hassle?
912059,comparing video games to porn is **exactly** what we need to be doing.
912070,very funny orignal definitely not a circlejerk
912079,yeah because owning a ton of champions is in no way an advantage.
912113,f*kin a. another brilliant example of fox news' intelligence
912124,lololol funny he wants to suicide
912160,"omg really should have paused to cancel uzis autos in those teamfights, i dont know what they were thinking since these are the most important matches"
912164,because he's in an elo that's he's obviously better then.
912208,well understandable since apple invented touchscreens.
912262,this is a totally original joke that i've never heard on the internet before.
912366,you should tell them to know their place and shut up before you slap them for insubordination.
912467,and that swastika looked beautiful.
912621,does watching games on the price is right count at making me a gamer?
912756,if only there was some sort cloud based system that got rid of disc's
912783,comon when will l4d2 go on sale?
912838,"yeah, no one would ever be able to guess the answer to that."
912849,"yeah, look at scarra his dexterity and reaction time is clearly terrible."
912875,yeah i won't believe him untill he posts pictures of his dead friend and crush.
912928,i can't believe someone made a painting based on the sriv picture.
912957,"yeah, only indie games with dev teams of less than 20 people"
913006,yeah i've never had any issues with my ps3
913031,sona's skills are now all skillshots
913089,"yay, another console focus game by ubi gets a pc version"
913101,they are the .01% so they must be matched with the 99.99% in order to get 100 percent to start a match.
913164,good plays but you know in lol its because they are bad not because you're good
913228,"agreed, with everything going on in the world, this is a real problem."
913286,"at this angle i can easily see what you are trying to show me, and with great detail."
913288,"i, too, consider my opinions to be facts and think the people that disagree with me or feel differently only do so because they're stupid."
913318,"yeah, being a dick to your employees is allowed at every workplace in the world, especially on the internet..."
913345,sure glad i had to leave cause of connection issues
913364,that'd be excellent for late night gaming sessions...
913397,yeah fuck him for having an accent.
913418,"ya, screw improvements and better designs."
913506,"because it corrupts our youth, and raises an immoral society"
913509,the exact same thing doesn't happen at all if you upgrade your current sony or microsoft consoles now
913513,"yeah because le sony only care about the gamers, they aren't in it for the money!"
913520,"nope, you're the only person on all of reddit."
913527,omg pls make another [fixed] post.
913554,"haha because driving at 200 mph doesn't take skill , right guys ?"
913565,"oh no.. how dreadful.. i can't stand it anymore, how dare m$.."
913627,"i swear i'm right there, the imagery is amazing"
913740,i thought steampunk just meant a brown shade of gothic.
913777,"because that isn't how equality works dammit, we are balancing the scales by giving one group an easy ride over the other!"
913828,"hitting f5 on /new/ every few minutes yields four or five new submissions, yep, the subreddit is dead."
913832,til egg laying hens have penises.
913992,"lol ya because women are supposed to do nothing but make sandwiches, amirite dude bros?"
913994,second only to the jews am i right?
914043,downvoted for writing the game title in post name ...
914081,"if you look close enough, you'll see that this is clearly photoshop."
914083,"right, whenever i've seen steven gerrard playing on television, he was only referred to as captain fantastic."
914131,"next thing you know, they're going to be telling me that shaco and darius aren't overpowered."
914279,we wouldent want that to mess up the rmah now would we...
914411,"yeah man, god forbid you don't get lots of karma!"
914488,"maybe you could put in pet freeze too, but that might require too much skill"
914493,"yes, and drow always gets bkb, and its always off cool down, and the enemy never has magic immunity piercing cc."
914501,"you sound like you're one of those totally fit and not fat, perfected skin with no acne, and attractive popular male in highschool."
914563,because everyone has a computer that can run skyrim.
914581,k. it's okay that you're frustrated over his skill regardless of handicap.
914589,noob annie playing 450ip champ report reporttt
914606,i look forward to losing elo cos unranked people are in games at plat elo.
914634,"exactly, just like how the nerevarine could only be a dark elf."

914707,then what the fuck would i have to complain about?
914815,oh my go it's a penis that's so funny
914816,maybe one of those 12 year olds who will track your ip and steal your account
914882,this is way more realistic than sniping in battlefield 3.
914896,the obvious reason people are doing things is because they are overpowered and need to be nerfed.
914938,"mexico over the rest of the world, fuck yeah!"
914953,"true, posts like aphromoo guy is going to take clothes off on stream are way more worthy than this, completely"
914962,"it's run by that super evil company, microsoft."
914999,"great observation, i would have never noticed that without your insight."
915006,"i sure am glad someone downvoted you, because you certainly weren't adding to the conversation at all."
915009,man china get's everything before us...
915022,"no, he's playing her in mlg because the champion sucks..."
915075,"so after apple got their cut, you must have made like 50 grand!"
915102,heyyy guys he mentioned something from call of duty come downbote him
915109,i'm sure you won't regret that one at all.
915116,"yeah, it would suck if elder scrolls had fetch quests."
915163,"yeah, that's *definitely* the most reasonable explanation."
915201,well that seems like a usful tidbit of info to hold onto...
915217,well this clearly means that the alliance are far superior players to the horde.
915239,obligatory what texture pack is that?
915253,"what, you don't level janna's healing spell first?"
915332,its a real shame they charge you for an expansion pack and then update the content in that expansion pack for free
915333,but then no karma for screenshot!
915341,sucker for not getting the deal its an xbox 360 with cod:mw3 for only $59.99
915342,"but if there is money/prizes on the line you are allowed to do anything, didn't the dignitas drama teach you anything about e-sports?"
915374,but then how would they get all that karma?
915399,but they have an updated roster!
915416,marketing executives totally know what gamers want!
915425,"yeah, the rain of grenades was so fucking great."
915427,glad riot could make those 200 people happy
915450,ohh snap the internet going to explode they recommended the ps4 over the one
915461,"oh, right, how i couldn't know that..."
915480,ahhh the fish joke will never get old...
915481,"quality thread, a great discussion will surely be had."
915489,came to post similar except mine was oh boy craigslist is getting ready to blow up with $45 ps4 games with no case.
915492,"yes, i'm sure people who are casual players that play for fun in pub servers are going to hack."
915889,he just realized he bought killzone.
916167,"ugh, do we really have to put up with this shitty sale for 3 months?"
916265,"no, absolutely nobody on reddit remembers this at all."
916637,how do you know he doesn't have esd protected sheets?
916838,yeah man it really sucks that you have no ad based champions for mid and toplane you could pick up in such a composition!
916886,i'm sure naughty dog is going to spend man-years porting something from the ps3's cell/rsx architecture over to the ps4's x86/gcn combo rather than just streaming the existing version over gaikai.
917250,"oh, that explains the better performance i get in css on linux compared to windows."
917430,"fricking cheapskate, couldn't even make it with diamonds."
917542,"you heard him, since all gay people are still technically virgins, we can still sacrifice them to the sun god."
917552,yeah the whole reason i stopped visiting this subreddit is because of the whole feet circlejerk.
917567,i think someone's mad that the dogg prefers a console that's not theirs.
917593,"yea, fuck you, microsoft, for listening to all the rage from the internet and making changes to the platform... you guys can go fuck yourselves"
917730,because 9-chevron travel always goes *so well*...
917801,i'm sure the msm will be all over this.
917830,hmmm... well let's see here... the place the vault is in is a former drug house... probably something nice!
917835,"but we only want to play games, fuck innovation"
917873,"i know right, everyone will kick you if you don't have a stattrak awp boom!"
917874,because lol is trash obviously what is wrong with you it obviously takes no skill..
917879,sure does suck that they are talking about a popular new game on gaming huh
917905,"to be fair, she wasn't even in the kitchen"
917942,stop having a different opinion!
918004,"yeah, gaming is all about gta v."
918132,"yeah, i'm sure that's the reason..."
918170,because that totally sounds like something rockstar would do...
918291,because you can totally make that judgement now
918342,"jungler gets 50% more gold from monsters, confirmed by riot."
918350,can't i just download more harddrive space?
918397,"i was unaware they were forcing you to buy their product, my mistake."
918403,"didn't you know, it's impossible to play video games and live a normal life at the same time!"
918429,"yeah, it's not like they're some of the highest-rated games of this generation."
918464,because my absolute favorite part of any grand theft auto game ever was grinding up the lung capacity stat for a mandatory swimming mission in san andreas.
918494,"yes, for the company that reddit constantly says it wants to boycott, lets pre-order their games to teach them to not raise prices"
918701,because thats how evolution works
918708,well then chargers must be so much better that they can get 150 more hp out of a smaller engine.
918814,but it wasn't relevant when it was posted one hour ago.
918837,"you could just, you know, buy a plane."
918855,technically you only need 10 bullets to win the round with an usp.
918870,this has to be a troll post... wait no.. north america is just another name for the united states my bad guys.
918889,i can hardly contain my excitement.
918910,"doesn't matter, not the parents fault but the game."
918929,"nope, have to pick my very best character and see how much i can wreck with it, then i need to make excuses every time i die since obviously it was just a fluke."
918959,it's because some pro players used it so it obviously has to be the best thing ever and if you use it you win and are considered good.
919032,"wow varus was so out of position, he stood within 1500 units of lee!"
919039,"i will pleasure your genitals so hard well he nows his sexy talk, that's for sure..."
919047,you can tell its not biased because he doesn't even own it yet.
919081,because they're different and we were obviously nothing like that back when we were their age.
919103,because retailers are still selling the original xbox.
919110,i think the real thing we can take from this is that jungle is so easy that you can just not be at your computer half the time and still get first blood.
919113,you *obviously* should've flashed away
919125,it's almost like he is normal human being..
919134,"yeah, cause he probably has nothing else to do than upload it within the hour."
919141,"woah that's awesome, where'd you find this?"
919213,i'm one out of 11k+ people that downvoted this... i guess were all drones
919229,but i can change cpu's on my pc and still play games fine... pc gaming master race
919242,i don't think this photo is high-res enough
919245,well you can still just use your xbox 360
919254,"wow i had not seen this yet, big news indeed!"
919256,cuz you know the 360 will totally run for another 5 years.
919261,"cause you can't play your ps4 on a cereal box, god damnit sony, you just keep hiding shit from us."
919272,this is incredibly shocking and out of character for such a well respected and beloved video game company...
919276,only is gazillion is in charge of costume prices.
919281,because me being able to share games across vast distances is screwing me over.
919284,"yea, watching bot lane for the enemy plays when i was playing top is surely the best course of action in a ranked match."
919297,"who needs to check the window when running down mid, it's not like the ct can easily kill you."
919305,*it is unclear what caused this huge change in policy right after e3*
919434,"yeah, when someone talks about rome i have to go play assassin's creed brotherhood."
919469,"same here best part was my friend did this repeatedly and wondered why we demoted him, he then later made multiple withers at the spawn :d just fantastic!"
919475,that's a sure way to counter her...either waste flash everytime or have a blink champ and be near wall.
919497,"i dont like your comment, take it off right now!"
919560,i'm sure the people who work on the air client are the same people who debug in game issues.
919593,then you are a filthy pirate and they don't want your business.
919594,because money is a problem in gtaiv.
919634,"yes, yes, and i'm sure god is real just because people believe in him."
919701,wow... no one has ever posted this before...
919802,wow attractive women that don't even know what they're dressing as.. let's all upvote!
919886,"i find it incredibly offensive that his profile pic is pedobear, and being a stranger on the internet, i don't give a shit what you think, but i want you to tell him that's not cool right now because he's way too young to understand it."
919951,this game was obviously a minecraft ripoff.
920003,i'll preface with the irony tag so you don't get confused in future.
920075,only white people played video games in 1990.
920082,maybe he was taking smite for lane control.
920112,i'm sure you have plenty of friends.
920200,"sure, because upvotes/downvotes are the agree/disagree buttons on reddit."
920202,"but it's less stupid the fifth time around, right?"
920203,i bet you're really fun to hang out with.
920236,but you can pay (real money) to skip the timer so it's actually an *improvement*!
920245,these submissions never get old
920251,"yeah, when someone mentions eg, their cs team is all i can think of."
920318,did you let him top you fucking retard?
920320,but elo hell isn't supposed to let people gain elo.
920336,"lets be honest, riot just ban anyone who gets 1 report against them, even when they are nice people who never say anything bad."
920345,"check your privilege 4chan, cis scum"
920438,ohhh no...wouldn't want to do that...then he might actually get played like all of the other current broken champions we have right now.
920464,"um, clearly because only 90's kids would get this!"
920467,"oh, so that's why i haven't seen them since my first pass through kun-lai."
920475,"because this isn't fanart, which is the only bad content on this subreddit."
920476,"no way, tamriel is way bigger than an entire star cluster."
920542,darius seems to be having a really hard time.
920548,hey can i get some aloe gel for this mad burn?
920620,"but dude, you're forgetting iseries!"
920630,well they have to get the drm right
920653,"dos is one word bro, not an acronym."
920692,just play single player until traffic slows down.
920694,"also, capcom makes terrible games and are the worst company ever"
920700,i may have some news for you...
920704,"yes, because saying that soraka doesn't take skill must mean that i hate playing support."
920768,"great angle of the bike, i really see what you're talking about"
920797,but they should lower ip and rp prices 6.3k too much runepages too expensive pay to win yaddayadda
920817,he's clearly an adult who is immune to nostalgia
920837,"shut up man, my true elo is 1900 and i'm just stuck down here in elo hell because of nubs ruining my games."
920858,isn't this where you are supposed to apologize for your canadian-ness?
920872,it's obviously meant to be played as a standard shooter where you just skip through all the boring dialogue and plot.
920898,"assume guilty until proven innocent, right?"
920910,theyre not gonna get sued and shut down
920933,but god help us if another company does it with a different game *cough* call of duty.
920944,"what are you talking about... i always build a gunblade on my ap casters... i mean, they have so much ad to take advantage of it with..."
920981,looks like everyone was right and jax is useless now.
920993,yeah it had nothing to do with the score being 22-2
921003,"women play battlefield, real men play mw3."
921011,"well isn't this new and exciting, we have never seen this posted before."
921012,yeah cause the same people that work in design also are in charge of the client as well.

921064,hurrr omnislash durrr im a riot i make teh good abilitiesss.
921067,the kid should of learned spelling.
921078,and my pc will never be able to run this without exploding ;_; *if only there were some crazy karma whore who would send me a brand new rig*
921080,"oh thanks for pointing that out, could of swore that's what minecraft actually looked like."
921099,"lol, nevermind - no harm done!"
921121,this isn't a screen shot... should be deleted.
921123,optional graphic enhancements=bad.

921176,"hey regi, grats on the pentakill!"
921187,i forgot to mention i was a professional artist.
921198,"they're just scanning for installed games i'm 100% sure, this is ea we're talking about."

922324,yeah us gamers are literally persecuted
922369,but why would i want to know what a bunch of noobs were feeling?

922875,"omg i know it's getting so ridiculous, omg i hate this subreddit"
923067,"yeah, everyone should be silent during games and have no energy at all."

923253,10 minute drop timing so hard to execute
923282,mass effect x bioshock romance scenes woo!
923396,what do you mean everyone knows that the safest thing to do with your private popular game client is to give the source code to an unreliable developer in china.
923519,the best thing about a map like this is you can have lots of awesome collection quests for achievements!
923534,"that's a pretty original concept for a comic about mario, you got there."
923592,"i guess he's not butthurt, who would've guessed?"
923606,"because it's better to give $1,000,000 to world championship winner then actually spend that money to fix euw servers."
923607,"thanks for five in parenthesis, i've been wondering what the v meant for so long."
923659,laws exist to protect the children.

923972,"in response to the cboat info he spewed last week, which has always been valid."
924019,op seems so excited about winning this ps4 based on his comments in this thread.
924056,"yeah because if you're british but live in the us, then you are american."
924221,because this totally looks likes that and not a homemade costume that personal effort was put into
924298,i really need to stop forgetting to put in the

924522,"what are you talking about, ap graves is too strong in the current meta."
924551,"yeah i wish game companies had terrible marketing schemes too, cause thatd be good for the industry im going to be working in."
924575,"of course not, all the pros use em."
924619,"oh yes, while they are at it, they should totally add a third summoner spell so people can flash while their ghost while they revive."
924663,well he plays cod so he's obviously functionally retarded and doesn't have the mental capacity to remember 10 character's names.
924676,well glad to see the mods are filitering out the shit posts.
924701,where is aquaman: battle for atlantis?
924705,"inb4 it was all scripted for gamecribs, a week with no lcs matches and they're running out of content."

925086,who's that yellow crab-like champion over there?
925089,"omg, my mom wont buy it for me... therefore... i hate it!"
925093,"yes, when a company has a monopoly, prices always come down."
925095,til melee carries are viable again
925097,even the psone was backwards compatible.
925106,yeah... we are definitely moving towards a society where it sucks to be a white male.
925113,making and a-moving marines to diamond is pretty casual.
925115,also upload speeds are terrible because your data has to fight gravity.
925123,yeah because people who post harmless advertisements on websites are a lot worse than criminals.
925151,"i agree, and then blizzard should make all the elite raiders register as raiders so that they have to pay $100 per month subscription so they can spend that money to create the epic looking raid you want."
925166,being asked to watch everyone of my friends streams.
925167,"yea, because if you don't get your career/education all in order by 25, your life is finished and you can't do anything about it."
925192,"ah, yes, this picture really helps me see how awesome this music is."
925198,"wow that's a really good tactic, i'm sure you showed them."
925200,how dare people not have enough extra money to buy a game that has been out for awhile!
925249,"now i think about it, those two series are very similar engine wise."
925270,because skyrim is the only instance ever when taking someone's knee out with a sharp object is a fast way to end a battle before it begins.
925306,"yes, because obviously making a 3d rpg is *so* simple."
925318,that's such an innovative idea.

925495,it's what they would have wanted...
925515,"but thats not enough, i need more healing d:"
925557,"but nvidia said it sucks, what gives?"
925559,but then you don't get the satisfaction of making someone feel bad for asking!
925569,"i know right, it's like a $1000 cabinet"
925581,"yes you are right, sk is surely better."
925584,says the guy who camped storm peaks for 6 months and wants to pass it off as luck.
925619,"if he held his phone correctly, instead of a really awkward way, tsm would be a powerhouse in the lol scene; this just goes to show how completely unprofessional and how little they take their game seriously."

925668,"the server's hard drives for singleplayer are slow too, duh!"
925696,yeah guys gta is totally copying saints row
925713,but pirates are the reason games don't sell

926326,"yes, him blaming froggen was the first bad thing ocelote has ever done..."
926359,"yeah, how dare clg have fans that support them!"
926432,"fairly certain i have more than 200 diamonds, is my game broke?"
926604,"well yeah, they should really follow the lead of reddit where every post also cites its source."
926645,will it require your wii u to be hooked up to the internet to play it?
926697,"no way, keanu's don john is the best villain ever, also hilarious."
926726,"except, it's more like ordering your hamburger, and finding out it doesn't come with wheels!"
926770,let's stick to questions about rampart.
926874,"sweet, finally a use for the built in thermostat in my laptop!"

926952,til sega only makes sonic games.
926975,"wow, poor kid, anyone should know fuck is a really dangerous word!"
927015,"rammus has a 2000 elo main, he was just playing on his 1000 elo alt to troll."
927044,because it's not additive and there totally aren't other reasons to have them.
927075,"yes, because lvl 30 summoners with 800 wins and money spent on rp is the majority of the lol player base."
927081,wow looks like steam sales wont be able to top this
927084,that's why team fortress 2 is for xbox and ps3 and not on pc!
927146,"this book looks enchanted too, must have some sort of hidden and unwritten sharpness xii aspect or something like that"
927153,"i only trust advertisements that use odd punctuation and all caps, so this is perfect..."
927156,"seriously, we get so many gaming events that i don't go to any, because there's so many that i just can't decide."
927159,"oh no, all our the precious space."
927171,yup... no one has brought this up.
927177,"from what i'm seeing it's like that out the box, no voice command needed."
927178,the no signal output looks better on his tv than the shitty xbox logo
927201,well it wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for that stupid store clerk!
927226,i'm going to use it as a bumper sticker.
927257,haven't seen this a thousand times.
927891,and yet we have such trouble taking girl gamers seriously...
927924,oh fuck my karma don't downvote me pls
928005,"yea dude, fuck premed and fuck college, let's just go play league, which could be a hit or miss."
928036,because every satellite is skylab...
928588,"ya, there is no reason that janna shouldn't be able to solo vayne like all the other supports."
928672,"yeah, force them to separate, sounds like a good way to make them not troll you."
928841,"nah *everyone* was bronze 5 at one point, the game even starts you at 0 elo not 1200."
928943,there is literally only one team that makes only 1 thing at a time.
928945,"yeah, 'cause i really want to give the government the power to determine who is a demagogue... they would never abuse that!"
929170,needs more lens flare and fake hdr.
929180,"yes, people posting on a sub reddit that isn't run by valve will *definitely* make them prioritize it."

929640,i wonder if a screengrab from this video will be included on the news report of this kid killing a bunch of people because of this game.
929653,i guess you accidentally did this every time you got banned?
929730,"they don't need to do anything, all of the internet rumours regarding their specs and power are 100% correct truthfacts."
929804,"which is why siv totally takes clairvoyance all the time, outside of this video."
929825,"has worked very well with other games, like dota 2 and league of legends."
929839,"video game, screw you man the internet is serious business."
929841,"no but you don't get it, cod is mainstream and for retards, and is nothing like counter-strike."
929858,"got that exact poster for free from tesco, cant believe its worth so much!"
929907,somebody forgot to put in the sleep()!
929986,yes obviously i was totally serious about standing whoever named it up and letting everyone kick them in the nuts.
930016,"yea, i'm sure these posts are getting in the way of all the other great quality posts we see on this subreddit all the time."
930049,"yeah just like when all the pro players went to seattle and gave their opinion, that worked out well."
930090,garena users rejoice we get skins earlier.
930149,"here i am, sitting here for the last couple of hours, trying to figure out what the joke is."
930249,"i see an obvious connection between this and league of legends, thats why you get an upvote"
930264,that is a **whole quarter** worth on $$$ mind=blown
930281,ya the koreans definitely don't have as much mechanical skill

930456,thanks for censoring the swear word so now i can show this post to my child...
930459,"how is that possible, din's fire, right?"
930514,well you aren't a real gamer until you spend 50 grand...
930540,"no, i must have missed that between watching the video and the other 30 odd comments pointing it out."
930543,"i think they should just reduce shoulder size on orcs again, the community really seemed to like it the first time!"
930547,i think it stands for league of legends.
930574,"yeah, because mario isn't popular in the slightest!"
930595,"yeah, they should not get any money or community support until they finish their game!"
930645,"diamond and plat players might as well put up a camp fire since they will have to wait for an endless queue if riot ever decided to add this and surely there is no way to abuse this system, it sure seems trollfree"
930659,some people prefer chinese democracy
930661,"no way man everyone knows that are always 4 retards on your team, and you're not one of them so you gotta mute them instantly no matter what they say"
930710,im thinking that the new engine frostbite engine is that they change the blue filter to a yellow one
930768,"and it's just as sad how men in general stereotypically can't cook, clean or do anything to take care of themselves to the point that they have to find someone else to do it for them after they left their mother's house."
930777,i thought she was from a game called link: the game of triforce
930837,this is a fantastic way to get people to agree with you
930934,the speed that the helicopter was crashing through the water seemed real too.
930935,you're so much better than everyone else then!
930974,yes because we all know everything about it and how much it sucks already.
930978,"wow, thats crazy that they never thought of that!"
931065,yes of course xbox has many more exclusives good eye
931067,even better when you support great community friendly companies like gamestop by buying used!
931069,"yeah, but he didn't spin it the right way."
931107,*look at that decent internet connection*
931115,**your wife isn't a real soldier because she can't play on a games console while out at war**
931125,"psh, how would *you* know what server this is on?"
931138,which is why there is so little competition in the (never been regulated) tech industry.
931144,"oh good, i didn't think i'd ever get one."
931162,"yeah, really shuts down her sustain"
931182,"le epic get trollolelled, le trick'd."
931215,"yeah, you have to actually spam one or two depending on the situation, that's so hard."
931224,"yeah, whats a picture from minecraft got to do with minecraft?"
931320,the fact that mrn got into lcs rly shows how bad they are
931327,oh ok i guess i am deserving of downvotes.
931329,"you're right, he is garbage and any 200 elo scrub could have made that play, he should be ridiculed for making such a bad play."
931330,"oh boy, i'm *super* excited now, 6+ years after i beat it on xbox (assuming it isn't launching until next year at the soonest)."
931331,"yay, more origin drm required games"
931332,glad to see its as console focus and bloated as bf3
931372,oh wow i've never seen a tutorial on this before.
931405,"what do you mean, you people?"
931410,"oh yeah, because i just spoiled the entire show for you."
931416,must have blood and gore to be mature for me!
931449,"yes, this is why they are going belly up, and cannot afford to develop the ps4, cameras, tv's and other shit they make."
931484,"and north korea doesn't have a nuclear weapon, let's wait for their government to make an announcement."
931504,"ya, i never see vi, lee, xin, jarvan going frozen mallet/black cleaver from the jungle..."

931581,"irelia needs to get nerfed, don't argue with statistics bro"
931609,but... but... what about... cows?
931641,ya sivir is already fotm and has the highest win % of the game and sees lots of tournament play so i can't imagine them doing this for her at all.
931651,"of course its bullshit, its part of my job description to know this shit... it cant be true right?"
931683,yeah i hate big box games any ways
931692,"right, because all judges are paid off and the entire justice system is corrupt."
931816,considering the item was designed for adc's its k just let the bruisers have it they struggle to kill the ad in the current meta
931829,clearly mmr is flawed and if i didn't constantly get noob teammates i'd be in challenger tier.
931863,"i know, top comment... man my scrolling finger is tired."
931875,"well if it is shredder, he will probably lose against cho'gath, given his history with aliens from space."
931886,good job acting like a mature adult.
931966,"oh yeah, what an awful life you guys must have..."
931981,having sales would lower the value of their intellectual properties.
932052,yeah because ad casters have no problem staying alive
932065,"agreed, every tank should have a macro calling people idiots."
932163,no man its all elo hell's fault im like 2k player ez but my team always feeder nooblords
932196,"but he's an android user... that clearly means that he's better than you, isheep."
932198,"yes, because everyone wants to discuss concentration camp tactics on a league of legends subreddit."
932302,"because it was arguably the most balanced map in the game, and people don't like balanced."
932328,"wait till you open the auction house and see 30 auctions, yea, youll love it."
932335,but i thought stephano was american?

932366,"i don't really care about this, it isn't that cool."
932423,are you sure he didn't copy-paste it from the image and censor it out to protect our fragile little minds?
932461,and i had such high hopes for him to begin with.
932529,how will they convince you to buy microtransactions if you're offline?
932554,"you assume he's white just because of his name, yeah you're not exhibiting signs you're insensitive to what racism is at all."
932569,"hmmm, ps3 controller already here but requires set up or shell out almost the same price as a game for a controller... i wonder which is more efficient."
932580,because pokemon and zelda are the pinnacle of gaming
932622,"so nice that you had to label that she was a bitch, i would have never guessed it from the content of the post"
932623,"yes, he definitely needs the attention when he's one of the most famous lol players on the planet."

933059,fleet is a very key point in the gameplay.
933065,but people who play the game a lot don't deserve rewards!
933068,or you can put wooden blocks behind the glass.
933129,you know my disc drive was working great but suddenly not so much.
933133,how about you clean your fuckin rooms you pigs!
934239,"the fountain diving at the end was a prime example of how tryhard kr solo queue is, compared to na and eu."
934619,but it requires logic to come to that realization.
934677,"congratz op, you're figuring it out."
935017,because everyone knows you can only life steal from living objects like wards...
935170,how dare they put boobs in video games this obviously affects everyone personally.
935191,now available for mobile and tablet!
935197,because a top tier eu team has way worse mechanics than asian teams because asians 2 gud for us hueheueheu kappa
935244,my best friend pre-ordered the ps4 and i immediately ended our bromance and severed all ties with his family.
935301,i'm surprised that there isn't a response already!
935347,well who would use gamebreaking in a title without actually meaning it?
935380,"ummm...dont you know that the more the champ cost, the more op he is?"
935418,damn and that was without the wii u version.
935458,"i wonder if people will be able to sell software for the steambox, without going through valve."
935569,"well, verizon is coming into the mix... that should make the internet better."
935580,gee this won't cause any controversy
935628,yeah.. because this totally happened.
935639,"and they should make a heroine mundo, magic mushroom teemo, and cocaine jynx."
935647,"you're aware that beta means runs the same as release but i get the game earlier, right?"
935761,"oh yeah, i've done that before."
935768,man i haven't seen this posted here before..
935799,"yes, for the love of god, make sure it's styled exactly like the last one..."
935839,how would the guy from shark tank know how well the game is running?
935863,in unwinnable games i find it is best to focus on trying to ks the single kill in a team fight where my team gets ace'd then say in all chat can't carry these scrubs
935882,they dont even look like they would be good.
935897,wow what a piece of dung im switching to the xboxone
936004,am i the only one who breathes air?
936040,because they support homosexuals.
936075,reddit is the same group of people...
936105,i'm so glad that lol is so balanced and free of bugs that this is something that riot could pay someone money to do.
936187,"post-it notes, how do they work?"
936197,god forbid people use left hand models
936273,yeah man farmville is where true gamers are made.
936287,titanfall is totally new and mind blowing and innovative
936347,so your that bastard that steals all those bikes
936380,"yeah, because we've all seen how the well the developers have taken advantage of the extra power in the ps3"
936408,"it's gaming related, because the tank is part ps4!"
936443,"it's obviously a unique, original and creative joke which makes us laugh everytime it pops up."
936447,but isn't it so obvious that every random person on the internet knows what's better for you?
936456,"yes, because everyone had a pc in their living room connected to their tv with four game controllers hanging off it."
936501,i too enjoy breaking immersion and searching every corner of the map.
936738,"yeah, why make a component modular and easily replaceable when you can integrate it in the main chassis so if it fails you have to replace the entire system?"
936767,im 16 and i know more about the world than him
936784,"of course, everyone knows ram is what matters!"
936817,i'm sure the general public would love a mcnip burger.
936832,"wow that's real quality content here, thanks op, must have taken some time to create..."
936849,i am totally sure that one in a long line of sequels will *totally blow everyone's mind* in a way which can be compared to *citizen kane*.
936858,"yes, the risk of being banned for not reporting a bug is totally worth having a unique, yet completely useless, pet."
936868,"yeah, 'cause we can't issue console commands when in singleplayer creative mode."
936879,you're not allowed to enjoy video games!
936888,"yeah, but what else do they have?"
936897,it's almost as if it's not a logical impulse.
936918,"simple announcement oh yeah, real simple."
936922,i'm scared to suggest that there 'needs' to be an additional subreddit for riot support
937000,"you should work on mortal kombat next, it isn't that hard..."
937062,le upvote for le you le gentlemen le sir le
937126,"yea, fling was doing all the damage and not the aa's + poison."
937162,i wonder why they deleted it then.
937174,because avatar wasn't a movie about a hyper realistic alternate world derived from an art style.
937213,"yes, he fights wither skeletons in *real life*."
937284,any other fans of the best pistol in the game no i don't imagine any of us like it.
937307,"actually it was eg trolling, did you see them all dancing around mid while gg was 2-manning baron?"
937325,yeah because you totaly need to spend thousands of dollars to get a good pc.
937354,"yeah, that vayne pick worked out real well"

937574,congratulations for being the first person ever to post this!
937621,"seems you don't like socialising, you're probably a communist."
937657,"but if someone has a different opinion from me, they're obviously being paid by the developers!"
937679,i'm glad this photo series does not edit out the vast majority of adults that were at launch as well in order to cast halo 4 in a negatively biased light.
937688,"nope i'm pretty sure my nostalgia just confirms that the first mario games i played were the best, end of story"
937692,it's like they want to push everyone to esea with 128 tick servers...
937747,"oh please, that's way too much to ask for these days."
937762,"wow, i have never even heard of tba, but i look forward to seem them play so many matches!"

937833,"but 12 year olds can't play league, it's rated t!"
937848,"wow, way to lower the skill ceiling so that even noobs will be winning tournaments soon"
937882,this man's answer is totally legit.
937926,nice try guy at blockbuster trying to get more people to come and rent games/movies at blockbuster.
937931,"link to 9gag, reddittor for 4 minutes...i'm sure you're just going to be rolling in upvotes."
937935,ha this circlejerk never gets old.
937975,"wait, i thought that's what we were complaining about to begin with?"
937978,what a beautiful and unique snowflake.
937980,i can't see this being abused to harass people out of game.
938031,no you're just an entitled brat.
938059,"no, they are focusing on important things like achievements!"
938076,"it's not like the pollution they create would actually go from the road to the pavement, right?"
938095,"bravo sir, please tell me more of your original and witty jokes"
938142,"no because being a woman is *bad*, no matter what you can do."
938146,but how can you live without right click?
938192,you sound like you'd be a really fun dad...
938205,"dammit people, stop throwing invisibility potions on everything."
938226,"someone accomplishes something that is very cool and difficult, better be a dick to make myself feel better about all these n00bs i get stuck with."
938270,i bet he used some sophisticated programs that he wrote himself to do it!
938302,"because modern warfare sucks, and infinity ward and treyarch should just let dice take over the modern shooter market!"
938327,"fancy, and this is my wip texture, and i'm pretty sure it is designed for transparent leaves, although i wouldn't know."
938334,"this shall go in the history books, grammatically correct sir!"
938342,i wonder if he download the new controller upgrades that came out today.
938379,"no, because that's obviously communism and if you do the terrorists win!"
938408,that's no excuse for bad physics.
938441,"yeah, because women who don't agree with feminism don't exist, they're just a myth."
938442,what a surprise on m5 being number 1!
938451,but yeah bro cod is still running at 60fps.
938505,"lol yea, blizzard and their shitty games."
938523,"sure, must have taken like five minutes to do, right?"
938537,"yes, apple has a history of opening their hardware to unlicensed use."
938567,"for an argument rooted in reality, you're sure doing a great job of backing it up with facts."
938569,no killstreaks and they're for gay pussy faggots ...
938622,"except when he says that he enjoyed oblivion more than morrowind, in which case it's heresy"
938651,"do you mind, my kids are reading this."
938657,"just like the stock market is dungeons and dragons for rich people, right?"
938663,so instead of fixing it we have to underclock our cards... seems reasonable!
938666,since spending hundreds of dollars on a console is easier than not spending money on ea shit games.
938715,"so it's not going to have arenas, drm, and rmt then?"
938721,"yes, because everything in minecraft makes perfect sense."
938746,wow there is just no way this is a lie or an attempt to advertise on reddit.
938759,yes because in s3 no one ever bought pink/oracle to counter her...
938786,"\*hops on 1.6 server to observe wallbanging habits of players* omg, soloben is totally right, there's so much skill going on here and not just a bunch of nolifers randomly shooting at walls hoping for kills"
938787,"who cares if it's 30 fps, do you see those beautiful tree/vine textures in the halo screen?"
938798,"yeah, but on pc it comes with battlelog."
938799,"no hotlinking, i remember that game!"
938811,"your right, we should just have hordes of people posting parcel tracking screen grabs instead."
939994,you seem to know how much time it takes to make a new datacenter.
940061,"yea, the plug might not fit at first, just keep pushing until it does..."
940235,the physics of the crumbling wall are staggering...
940251,"ah, that explains the reasonable performance in windows then."
940613,"yes, just like people judge that c9 is much better than fnatic now."
940658,the christmas spirit is strong in this one
940693,yes because everyone that plays video games is failing high school.
940704,"it should straight up block all abilities, but a champ having an ability that cancels out spells would be broken..."
940728,"mobs riding mobs are *such* lame jokes, aren't they?"
940754,i don't have the heart to tell you that koopa is now known as bowser (although sometimes koopa is given as a last name).
940802,"2.5d shmup with too many particles to see anything... sure, that is a good idea."
940823,"yes, because ignoring their entire system and anything that happened during the season, and then giving out rewards based on a hidden stat that no one is supposed to know makes more sense."
940999,any reasonable person would have obviously already taken the entire week off so they could play the game.
941061,because you need to have a green card in order to play in the lcs
941075,yah without this video i would have never known a game with 5 people playing together works better if everyone uses teamwork
941113,"it's a eu thing bro, you americans don't understand"
941176,these get more and more believable each day.
941225,"youre probably right, the whole thing is a big mistake, and it wont make any money or be useful to anyone because the entire custom linux distro built specifically for playing video games thats open source is no different than running an hdmi cable from your windows box to your computer."
941251,"god damn, i might as well just kill myself because there's nothing left to live for anymore."
941262,"then go ahead and give it a try, since its so easy"
941321,good thing i have a day time job and a lot of other hobbies that take away my time in the evenings...
941347,"the car will turn on in a few weeks, you should not be so entitled"
941352,good argument.. many well thought out and insightful points
941371,clearly you aren't a fan of lol esports.
941457,"if we threw all of the esports money at the client, imagine how godlike the client would be!"
941474,probably because you played violent video games.
941486,"don't be mean, he just has problems managing his weight."
941554,"yes, because nobody has ever changed their mind about a tatt gotten just to be edgy and make a statement."
941565,"play on agency, where cts have to push?"
941574,"well, they can just do nerf rotations to make people play other champs"
941612,because i assume you don't do any activities at all that could be considered unhealthy.
941618,"dude, fizz is severely underpowered, like his early game and late game are such crap, he lacks both damage and utility as well as mobility and initiation."
941725,good thing mw3 is totally worth it amirite
941826,"oh boy, i've never seen this before"
941964,"according to the esea forums, she is a roster-destroying wench whom all the invite players fall for."
941984,i like how it looks as if you simply removed the watermark with that white bar!
942007,lol civilization 5 is so unrealistic
942009,"oh yeah, i forgot cleavage = scantily clad."
942014,"this is how fast packets arrived... which is precisely what lol does, send/receive packets, but ya, i'm sure that info is useless"
942037,i'm sure that was riots reasoning behind banning him.
942137,oh yes look at this comment it adds so much to the discussion
942150,"wow, the pros sure do have a lot of throwaway accounts that they answered on."
942157,"this game looks pretty interesting, but there aren't enough tits in this picture."
942207,because ps+ is free and you keep your games when it expires
942228,but clearly everyone knows that it's the worst thing ever.
942400,you learn something new every day...
942571,"yeah, because i'm sure if noobs played competitive everyone would have so much fun."
942662,"on behalf of the reddit community, *thank you* for ruining r/gaming."
942663,"nice argument, i hate all the aimbots that come out on the consoles..."
942695,"and seeing how the xb1 is definitely anti-gamestop, we can assume without a doubt that this is un-baised"
942700,"if you are considering skipping semester in college to stream how you play in silver - college is definitely not for you, so go for it!"
942706,oh yeah because in 2016 every thing will be id tagged and if it was detected not having a tag it won't work.
942709,"none of these issues bother me, hopefully they'll change them though so that's alright."
942755,"look at that, the strong silent types... so much misogyny"
942775,this is to store all the data from the new kinects everyone will have
942792,it's a shame the flood didn't bring zombies as well.
942833,"yeah, this looks like a fair comparison."
942837,couldn't possibly be ea buying positive reviews...
942849,its almost like these changes are to a sort of testing client to see if they work
942853,"wow, thanks for breaking the circlejerk and submit some quality content."
942896,it isn't unpolished and jerky you're just too used to call of duty
943020,"because all mods are made by some random new guy to coding, right?"
943137,"thanks mods, i totally thought this was real"
943169,"yeah, because there's a new video card generation every year..."
943227,can't wait to pirate this because every single person at ea is a raging thundercunt who doesn't deserve to be paid for their hard work.
943256,i bet its funny for the people on his team too.
943268,of course they do it to rustle your jimmies.
943291,i'm sure everyone here is going to love a football joke.
943373,"half life 3 sux, i play halo 5 cause imma a beta tester at bungie so i get it sooner than all j00 guies!"
943411,because redditors don't love their children more than karma.
943497,my mario kart was stolen last week :( i wonder if gamestop has any in stock.
943528,i think we found the liberal arts major
943548,good cuz we need more kat players.
943567,"yeah dude, that game was horrible because it had a god damned nigger as a protagonist."
943667,til xbox users pick the colors of their interface.
943731,"to be fair it was a pretty long post, you can't expect everyone to read everything before giving their opinion can you?"
943803,"my god dota copied lotr, lotr copied incorporated myths and medieval warfare, medieval armies should sue,"
943817,and every team gives their 110% in scrims...yup...that must be it...there is no intentional hiding of certain aspect of their strats when winning and losing are without consequences..
943852,"but it's so original and it has humor both kids and adults can appreciate, which no one has ever done well before!"
943896,as a hunter my most common nickname is ninja for some apparent reason .. :(
943901,"wow, never seen anyone recreate 8-bit sprites in a minecraft-like game before."
943907,same thing happened to us in dota 2 we searched a match then the servers went down and were left waiting for a full 5 minutes before we realized steam was down.
943953,butthurt newfag doesn't like us - yep 4chan is much better
944002,hooray the wonderfully productive and informative debate about naughty nautilus made it to reddit!
944089,"simplify this simple game some more, please."
944108,"yes, the fact that usher is dancing in front of an xbox logo and advertising a *dancing game* makes me ashamed of having an xbox."
944125,yeah teemo needed a 7th skin so bad.
944181,how nice of you to leave karma out.
944184,yes jeez origin is just sooo bad
944193,"hmm, where have i heard of people using pre-made faces to make comics with limited humor...?"
944207,fully interactive murder sex simulator -fox news
944224,naw man this applies to blind pick.
944234,this game's gonna suck it doesn't even have killstreaks hurr durr.
944243,could it possibly be metal gear solid?
944247,mario galaxy 2 isn't all that great imo
944258,call an ass an ass just makes everything smell like shit.
944355,i would personally like to see proof that op even plays minecraft.
944361,"feel free to enlighten me, because you're clearly more knowledgable on this subject than i am."
944428,because fights between celebrities do not happen in any other industries...
944492,no it would to conventional for a game like minecraft
944881,"oh but he is vocal, doesn't that count for something?"
945952,"god forbid you can't change your haircolor for free, makes the game completely unplayable."
945959,yeah because people chat on lfr/lfd
946064,yeah vimeo is totally going to take down youtube.
946094,that's because you're the worst vayne na
946143,my gaming computer can handle it so it should be fine
946242,"yeah, and in the early 90's when most of us were kids we totally knew what kind of tech could and could not be found by consumers, because our media and movies totally gave an accurate picture of that sort of thing."
946331,yea only someone like descartes could tell that changing the intention of a post doesn't make it a repost.
946379,"yes, he deserves metric shit-tons of respect for mismanaging so much potential!"
946530,"lol yes, that's all there is to it"
946576,"yeah stats are completely worthless when determining skill, the only relevant factor is popularity."
946703,that's a very nuanced argument you make.
946821,"yeah i know fuck him for building community in game and teaching players about the game, what would a rank first dps and a progression tank know about anything...what a fucking douche"
946999,they should remove kitty kat then
947013,"oh, yeah, like *that* isn't possible"
947133,yep you're at 0lp in division v.. you're definitly where you belong.
947150,"no, maybe someone hasn't heard about it."
947185,ya that's why wow and starcraft 2 dominate their respective genres.
947190,i think you mean purple and teal.
947213,but man why would you wanna be super strong unless you needed to kick some parked cars.
947219,"pretty sure fizz counters karthus hard, and we all know he only plays karthus."
947262,dyrus is nearly as close in skill to silver players than he is to challenger players obviously.
947268,i started playing lol when vi came out and i'm only bronze 3 but i deserve challenger all these bronze bads are holding me back!
947307,i'm sure glad everyone knows the name of every town in every rpg ever so i can just go play this without asking about it.
947330,"perfect, olaf nerfs and fizz buffs."
947334,yeah because it's really common to be bronze in normals and then play ranked and go straight to diamond
947387,"you're on reddit man, remember, it's not okay to actually know something"
947460,i like how people blame steam all the time
947501,everyone at curse lifts...too bad none of them carry.
947504,"yeah, because women don't have to undergo physical activity to be physically fit."
947544,"indeed, copying lolesports is impressive."
947549,"yes, and gathering resources isn't tedious at all."
947616,genius noone thought about it before and noone know whats next!
947648,"my last name is lester, and this joke never gets old."
947709,because everyone wants sony's internet!
947718,"yeah, this guy making funny jokes.. sooo annoying..."
947751,"bronze ii here, what are these mechanics you speak of?"
947766,"thanks for having the name of the game somewhere, op."
947883,because skins are against the very essence of counter strike!
947926,"can't dodge targeted abilities anyway, not sure why this is here."
948013,thanks for being a swell gent and telling us the game in the title.
948117,it's so good the players stack up tanks and helicopters instead of playing the actual content.
948224,"oh, because not everyone already knew you can mount outside an instance and in the open world."
948307,ya wtf is riot thinking they should just give people +30/-10 so there can be like 50 people trying to qualify for challenger at the same time and there never being enough spots open
948323,"well, that doesn't look like the xbox one at all!"
948337,"yeah, they shouldn't have even bothered."
948343,"the ps4 is totally lacking games, you are right"
948344,how many games will support this is a good question though... because apparently adding full button mapping is hard enough as is for developers.
948346,you mean like the android and ios market?
948350,you're not a gamer unless you use gold.
948360,"nu uh hes op and riot should just nerf him, i mean afterall , he hasnt even been out for a day and the entire community has thought out every way to play against him so they should just nerf him already"
948378,yes... because those t3 cruisers balanced everything.
948383,planetside 2 is persistant... somehow i still have all my porn
948419,but you missed the totally bitchen first-person scene!
948425,how could i not upvote such a charming and polite post!
948465,"why would you do that, its just a gimmicky piece of trash that's completely worthless..."
948543,fixed title: hard decision at gamestop
948551,"but they did include emo dante, and that makes everything better"
948591,"well this truly is quality content, great post."
948597,but why would we pm you when we can all ask individually 100 times as comments?
948655,holy shit this low res gif looks amazing!
948680,"okay, go ahead and sona jungle, that's not trolling at all"
948840,but slender is the first game that slender was in!
948903,"fak u faget, you little shet twitch."
948917,and i am proud to be human like him.
948919,clearly the video games he played caused him to lead a violent life which led to his death
949012,it's funny because you're implying she's black.
949056,well i was going to upvote... guess not loser!
949060,yes play with your dog more...that will definitely stop their inherent need to chew on things that look like toys.
949099,"awesome 1:30 am est, i didn't want to play tonight anyways."
949100,"oh my gosh, i am genuinely surprised by this turn of events."
949200,"yeah, i hate having goals that extend the life of a game, or being able to play a game through multiple sessions."
949238,i did not see that coming at all... xd
949244,"according to your username, it is a glitch."
949250,obviously we just need to bring back easy info.
949312,"no, they will call it super smash brothers u."
949335,more glitch mob on lee sin vids pls
949345,but getting the pentakill isn't reward enough on it's own.
949401,"yeah, ez burst is so much better than graves."
949405,i mean it's not like the first link is black mesa a half life 2 modification and the following links a gaming articles about the release
949448,yeah let the guy in greens come because he is skilled and gear isn't everything.
949485,they copy more from valve then jsut dota :p
949558,"but then you are an unranked scrub and you dont have any clue of the game, unlike me with my 2k+ elo, im baws."
949563,"yeah, everyone thinks of ward jumping to the baron pit or lizard lair on instinct!"
949580,i'm sure women find those who intellectually carry discussion about the in depth strengths and weaknesses of videogame champions much more interesting!
949592,"right, it's named after the main character"
949646,facebook must run great on that.
949689,"shhh, we don't need those rules around here"
949707,"at this point, why not make all 'terrain' blocks smaller (like, half height/width/depth) so people can make any detailed shapes they like?"
949720,"hey guys, this will probably get down voted, but does anyone know about minecraft?"
949725,"it's ok, there's a mustache which makes it *totally* different."
949728,it's not the programmers job to unit test their code.
949740,yeah that must explain why they buffed him.
949750,never seen this before on reddit.
949842,"yea, because having a useful, online distribution platform is definitely stupid."
949854,you mean people play the game for fun at that elo because they don't really care about their elo or stats?
949894,you've obviously never played actual video games where the hardest thing the developers can imagine you doing is starting the game and walking for a minute.
949918,"better call forbes, they'll want to post about this."
949935,"oh yes, the graphics aren't impressive."
949953,how could you not like a battle system where the female gets more powerful the less clothes she wears?
950037,grand theft dinosaurs.. lets get back to the jesus era shall we?
950077,"don't worry, op is super human and will do the job of hundreds singlehandedly in a fraction of the time!"
950094,yeah but the headcrabs are like pawns so it's basically like playing chess.
950098,"weird, who would ever think that being the high priority ad carry would cause assassins/tanky dps to focus you."
950105,should i insta lock leesin...or ziggs
950114,i guess you're just bad at leaving the gameboy completely still across from your friends ir receiver/transmitter while still both holding the gameboy comfortably and playing with enthusiasm at the age of 12
950144,"yeah, gaming would be fine if nintendo never existed."
950150,"yeah its from pokemon, hue funny joke."
950304,til that alienware is overpriced.
950329,im glad you draw us the diagram with circle and big red x's
950341,is this even related to gaming?
950354,"legend of zelda, super smash bros, metroid, wii sports to name a few."
951306,hey monmon turning into captain hook turning into a dinosaur with a cannon on its back makes plenty of sense!
951426,"roit pls remove cdr timers on skills, it's not hard to count."
951557,"he can't be the worst person in existence, that role is taken by athene already."
951558,well... it does mean that gtav is 100% worse than oot.
951765,it's not like you vs a duo bot that fails just as many times as your duo bit has.
951813,i wonder why there wouldn't be that many members of the horde military in the vale of eternal blossoms.
952270,"nah man, remove the ui and all indicators, it dumbs down the game."
952469,"oh, and here i thought you were saying something false and retarded, my mistake"
952499,"o ma gawdz, riot clearly has no moneez and makes zero profit."
952530,"except good parenting, and we all know that's impossible."
952552,well i'm just glad history has proven that sex is a completely horrible way to advertise and that in no way will it draw sales for them.
952573,thanks for you contribution to society.
952613,yeah no one knew about him until he made the zed play on ryu
952627,ps4 is going to lose so badly now!
952631,"how is this even whoosh at all, he's blaming the downvotes for his race, which we can *obviously* see over the internet."
952695,thanks for putting the game in the title.
952696,the most surprising thing about this video is that hotshotgg is playing leblanc.
952711,"yes clearly a teenager that stays up to midnight occasionally is a horrible child, teenagers should be locked in their rooms at 8pm sharp!"
952726,"spirit guard udyr and pfe, those skins win games i swear."
952765,at least you don't have to put up for it for a couple whole weeks of the year to watch wf like those poor europeans.
952838,your two year old was just sick of you yelling racial slurs into the microphone...
952856,"judging from the uproar and furor that took place after the (since removed) once-every-24-hour connection was announced, we all know that the most important thing about console size is that it can be easily packed up and taken out to remote cabins in the woods where there is no internet available."
952869,"ya, why would anyone care about invisible points for karma?"
952889,"good answer, the solution to all of the problems"
952902,halved speed from phage and trinity will totally make him not viable...
952928,"well that's a deal breaker, guess i'll be getting an xbox one"
952933,why can't people be content just painting pictures of shit?
952998,can't believe i guessed the game by only the description.
953002,because poppy is supposed to be played support.
953116,"while we're at it, why don't they just gift us all the skins"
953123,no game ever had a forum for bug reports.
953173,sounds like a great relationship
953275,"them tell me bitch, why was there confusion."
953380,"good call, all the maps use wards so it would be universally useful"
953423,you obviously know a lot about game development.
953457,"yeah, this thread totally won't devolve into a flame war like all the rest."
953514,i thought i was the only one who liked that game..
953525,you should know about ddos playing on eu-w and all
953653,because it makes for a great reddit post!
953657,call of duty 1-10 had bridges that did also
953700,"because it listens and records everything but they guise it as listening for xbox on, it's the same uproar we saw over the galaxy s4 recording everything all the time because the screen unlocks when it sees a face."
953737,"ea is such a great company, i have always had faith in them from the beginning and my faith has payed off."
953779,levelheaded points like that have no place here
953817,yea lets make the art team work on the servers that will be good.
953859,you forgot testing the other hundreds of hours were spent on playing it privately for fun!
953997,"just because you can make money from something, that means its only reason you do it"
954023,just you wait until morde hits lvl 6 those ganks mang
954065,how dare you upload a photo in only 30 fps don't you know that doesn't use all your ram?
954072,"yeah gddr5 is so much better than ddr3 its got a g and a 5 in it, thats 2 more than ddr3, it must be better..."
954165,"and fuck people who don't play halo, they can always wonder what those rings are!"
954170,well we all know how unsuccessful tomb raider games are.
954219,"well of course the gun doesn't cost him $2,000 he's probably making them for pennies on the dollar."
954232,i for one will boycott kh and all se games for supporting m$ xbone.
954234,"yeah, this idea sure helped prevent all the shovelware from getting on the wii"
954240,im sooo happy you read the whooole thing.
954258,"yes, blame them and their children for needing food and time with their families."
954286,"yea, because it can't store info to upload later."
954299,yeah maybe they can start a team together
954328,"yeah, cause all xbox exclusives are first-person shooters!"
954330,because it's hard to find 14 year old voice actors?
954379,"wow, that means they really worked hard on the last one."
954382,"oh, a program crashed, that never happens with any other program ever, it must be an ea only thing."
954438,"well don't you know if you would've played perfectly you would've won, regardless of what your team was doing."
954453,"well, wouldn't the first thing you see be the back of your head, because you only pressed it once?"
954495,damn chaox was disrespectful to clg
954511,that's an extensive pool you have there.
954519,guess i'll have to go back to toontown again!
954559,it's not like they have millions of users with a steady income and can afford the costs of hiring people to do this.
954569,"because vladimir is a meele champion, and he doesn't have a slow either..."
954585,"poor eg, they only lose because they're the best and everyone tries harder against them"
954595,and they say world pvp is dead!
954715,"man i wish i had a quad core phone so i could play crysis on the go, alas i have the us version of the galaxy s3.."
954727,"nope, you're the first person to ever do it."
954857,it stacks with machete for crazy level 1 damage bro!
954861,and tell us what we're supposed to think ffs !
954905,yeah cause business majors are all in the business of fucking people over with shitty products.
954995,so damn funny omfg lolololololollolololololololololololololololololol
954996,clearly you are just jealous of his $1.50 to $2.50 he saved!
955018,"... yeah, that sounds.. mind blowing."
955026,"yes, nike shirts and ugg boots were all the rage back then."
955029,"hey, you're just trying to start a legend of zelda circle jerk you fanboy!"
955056,"good thing it wasn't a $2 bill at taco bell, you could had the cops called on you."
955062,always can count on redditors for help
955078,"yeah, cause we all know how great of publishers activision and ea are compared to thq."
955118,"sounds awesome:) and for boss battles, you climb the humans and stab them in the face!"
955121,"i saw a video of etho, top that!"
955147,you know ad hominem attacks work really well when you don't make any effort to back up your statement.
955248,so they were trolling us all these years!
955266,hopefully froggen will stop ddosing him.
955269,"woah, that reminds me of pixel art from borderlands 1 claptraps!"
955306,"yeah, because ea specifically called for blue tint and lens flare."
955323,"i heard from a friend of a friend that azubu already won the rematch, it was played this morning."
955376,i think we can all agree that there are not nearly enough games out there based on ww2
955409,the technology just isn't there yet.
955453,totally didn't expect the malphite nerf
955477,"it takes a long time for the bits to get all the way there, plus the translating the game from english to english, so it should cost more."
955503,yeah.. all those total war suck!
955516,a sound argument without any flaws
955571,"holy shit guys, this is obviously the next wow killer... blizz better be careful."
955573,i feel like bioware aren't listening to their fans because they haven't given blasto his chance to truely shine.
955625,but why don't they want console users
955647,"dear lol players, please play co-op or custom games to learn to last hit, map awarness and general mechanics love, an irritated player"
955678,"no, thats the worst thing ive ever seen"
955697,"damn urban kids with their rap music, they're coming to take away my hardcore games."
955763,its fun being a noob on dota 2 beta!
955783,this totally is worthy of the frontage.
955810,"now the pc gaming master race can wish they were never born, just like the console plebeians!"
955914,she has sworn to carry our burdens
955935,"the same can be said for project fiona, its an tablet with joysticks stuck on the side... woo, some damn good innovation right there razer"
956004,"russians, if you played solo queue on euw before the split you know how lovely they are not only to other people but to each other"
956015,"i disagree, therefore the statistics must be false!"
956043,"sorry, twilight came out today, i'll miss it."
956056,what he fails to mention is that minimum wage in australia is $15.51 an hour or 589.30 a week... america we get roughly 7-8 dollars an hour... (depending on state) i would love to be poor like you
956070,"don't worry man i'm with you, as they say an open mind is like a fortress with it's gates unbarred and unguarded"
956116,"it's funny, because it represents a horribly skewed stereotype about people who play a video game."
956168,"just like health insurance, car insurance, renter's insurance."
956173,"cause when i was in high school, **nobody** put something down on top of that wire mesh to do cocaine off of the tables."
956619,because one must be superior than the rest
957051,but that would most likely require a strong asian masculine lead and we know that is impossible.
957123,because your whole team sucks every game and you cant carry the whole team amirite?
957566,yeah but he has a pc therefore he must take every chance he can to let everyone know how much better it is
957726,"from 56% down to 51% win ratio, pig disgusting, will never touch again"
957899,let's have the game between top 8 teams at s3 worlds be worth the same as the game between two teams who were 1 game away from relegation!
957902,"i blame euw servers, they couldn't practice enough."
958010,i thought sony was our savior from the evil microsoft!
958077,but of course you still remember and use your windows live and rockstar social accounts everyday
958096,"well, this will add to her credibility considerably!"
958116,lolz but ddos so easy to protect just download something from internet or don't use skype l0l
958117,i'm sure he was absolutely fooled into thinking the playstation 1 graphics that he was watching were an actual real movie.
958318,the internet: land of originality
958421,"because, that just happens all the time."
958499,"of course, everyone knows psychopaths are born from violent video games."
958509,one bad pull by a tank in wow and he probably would have blown up a bank.
958563,never seen a post like this before
958609,"solo laners are well known for having no escapes, no sustain, and no reliable hard cc."
958618,"his weakness is that if a 0/4 renekton fights a 4/0 top lane counterpart, he might actually lose even though i play renekton and he's balanced cause i actually suck at this game and can only do well with one broken champ"
958646,"yup, unfortunately he will now spiral down into that depraved lifestyle, most likely from the game experience (no matter how vicarious) and without any possibility of parenting or mental issues having any impact on this behaviour."
958806,"yep, because all computers are used for gaming exclusively."
958823,by that logic why wouldn't you give it to gta v. it's newer and also has new features.
958842,dlc where you take the plane to quebec and end up commiting suicide
958866,"but they're korean, so it confirms that they are good ideas."
958867,"wow, that's never been suggested before!"
958876,who would think that is what an american would say?
958904,"i know what i am going to do, fight on the internet and downvote everything he says, that will get him."
958994,but it has those exclusive levels... totally worth the $39.96.
959018,anyone happen to look at the list of current bids... cause those sure seem legit.
959069,lucky for you the xbone will monitor your fun levels and report back to you how much fun you are having and also handily make sure if you leave the room or stop paying attention during a game commercial break it'll happily pause the commercial for you to make sure you don't miss out on exciting offers.
959128,yea why not add le epic rage faces and throw in epic fail and other shitty overused unfunny internet memes!
959252,as if saint hasn't said anything similar about anyone ever
959289,good thing apple have gotten past their obsession with form over function.
959324,i wonder why nobody else ever thought of this.
959364,but i thought videogames all turned kids into crazed psycopathic murderers
959405,"yeah, i totally didn't know what he was talking about until your comment."
959419,"yeah, because word of mouth and interest generated is actually useless."
959446,"weird, i never would have guessed this would turn into a bash xbox and bash ms thread"
959459,"they should make trynds ult, fizzs ult and fioras ult reset on kills too"
959463,"right, because what kind of retard can't figure out the title of a game just by knowing what year it will be released in?"
959523,well this has never been asked before...
959541,because they'll get sued for having unfair advantage over the rest of the market and cannibalize the gaming industry.
959549,"all he did was put down wards and use his abilities, any silver level player can do that."
959570,lol no rets can raid heal with word of glory tard!
959602,"i know, oceans being as big as they were before is so unrealistic."
959686,why would you need that everyone knows that consumers want multiplayer maps.
959733,"it's okay bro, hot chicks offend me too."
959779,"holy fuck, your parents named you drazil?"
959788,i didn't see that one coming...
959811,as a pc gaming master race member i can safely say i hate all of you.
959826,no i didn't spend at least 4-6 hours a night on it...
959864,what if you could get 10 gold everytime you place a ward?
959887,what's the giant thing behind the xbox?
959926,i guess you don't eat italian then.
959951,"i don't know, i thought sonic riders was pretty good."
959954,"i say, let's put that in place of the up arrow and the xbox logo instead of a down arrow."
959983,no because xbox is literally hitler and sony is half life 3
959990,but...but... i thought they were only in it to make me happy and to have fun.
959991,"i learned from reddit that i'm actually the only human on this earth who complete games anyway, so it would be a waste of developer time."
960002,gordon/morgan white/black i see no reason why not...
960030,this just has microsoft pr slathered all over it.
960035,"yes, that is totally what i said."
960036,junglers should be reported for stealing kills from lanes.
960046,"one less troll on league, lock him up for good!"
960098,"well but investors make a lot more money and what they do influences the inflation so prices are lower for everyone, man."
960178,"whatever, wanting to build a road where ever you want just makes you entitled."
960194,yay let's post this a million more times!
960217,"yea, because none of karma's abilities were changed at all, only her looks"
960284,oh you're gonna love gregtech then...
960363,"because racing is all about smashing into your opponent, right?"
960386,"ha, a series actually has to be popular to have a lego game made of it... and good."
960390,lol guise he made a condom joke!
960410,"you're the only person who has had the problem, i feel for you."
960420,yeah because at 1080p you can barely make out anything right?
960439,pepsico is really who you want to have ties with.
960461,well we all know how overwhelmingly pro-apple reddit is!
960467,simple - just texture the lava neon blue!
960475,it could be a collectors item so download it before they run out!
960495,"theater mode, that's the thing i'm missing from my halo 4 experience."
960512,and gta's driving was sooo much better.
960612,"jup, sim city 5 has everything i always wanted in a sim city game..."
960636,it matters because everyone should have what i have because it's obviously the best.
960641,yeah that's really harsh on all those 12 year olds that have to do that
960642,but it's funny because it's not xbox360cod420blazeit lol
960709,"yes, showing rage and aggression towards a treasured possession to make their children weep and cower in return for 'not tidying up' seems perfectly good parenting."
960752,every game needs more wagglefucks.
960760,i like how the *entire* background frame is a ford ad.
960800,clearly we need to build a fence to keep these insidious americans and their guns out.
960814,individual anecdote disproves logical theory.
960970,your insight has been the most helpful by far.
960995,how can you call yourself indie with a chair like that?
961015,"while we're at it, give some buff to kog, he's not in the big 3 and he has no escape while being incedibly squishy, so it's all fine to buff him!"
961027,then how come we delete comments?
961036,my individual uneducated opinion i made out of an assumption is 100% factual.
961041,"yeah, totally fucking entitled generation, people before that never had such a sense at all!"
961158,all the people who go to those schools are too busy making awesome videogames to post on reddit.
961165,yeah thanks for answering my question...
961168,"you're in r/gaming, stop acting like origin might be useful for something!"
961172,clearly was intended top play from lee sin wtf?
961178,"yeah, because they were planning a pc port all along."
961183,"and reddit admins are, of course, incorruptible symbols of purity and decency who would never allow personal relationships to compromise their impartialility."
961204,i've heard overwhelming the consumer with choices is the best way to get them to buy new
961290,that .05 reduction will definitely make a difference.
961372,"now, i know you're all excited just like me for evelynn to be viable and for the next week following the rework to have at least one in every game, but let's be patient for this."
961384,because we're paying for it obviously!
961405,you are right why didn't i see that before
961408,tell us more about what games your dad has.
961418,"it's not people looking to gain power will attempt to do so in areas of turmoil and war, whilst those in charge are too busy trying to kill each other."
961429,they let someone who types with ur as a word become a preschool teacher?
961435,those were the good days man...those were the good days.
961446,"oh, well if we don't like them, i can see why it's okay to rip them off"
961491,"don't you know you're never supposed to push the lane, only last hit or else you get ganked?"
961522,i prefer muscles and penises too!
961579,look harder there is a literal gem there.
961633,i like how one seller is selling it new with no box... for $150
961678,"in boston's defense, a lite brite looks exactly like a bomb."
961725,"must buy new madden game every year...need updated rosters, graphic enhancements, and an improved hit stick"
961769,yeah we need a superhero yordle
961798,"wow, great fucking content guys."
962269,i really think the game should auto-buy me arm/mr items based on the enemy team composition too.
962360,a driving game with no cars... what?
962927,that ahri sure knows how to land beast-like charms
963077,"shh it's reddit, as long it's for the upvotes, it's okay"
963137,ocelote made a really cool video that helped him promote his future options
963145,"wow, so your team traded a few of their players away and now you want to bandwagon with another team?"
963151,"considering they've sold more than a million systems, that doesnt look good that everyone has only streamed 20 minutes."
963340,"when hacks finally get stopped completely, this is what will be left at global elite"
963415,yea dumbass how dare you not exactly what happened in all scary moves.
963651,"yeah, teamfight starts and all you'r looking at is where the ef is your axes landing so you do damage."
963731,hotshot plz pick up veigar bot for nien.
963786,aw yes lets all talk about how we've been c9 fans since before they went on a huge win streak!
963794,"the only people who like these mainstream casual console games are dumb children, not the glorious pc gamerstm of reddit."
963956,because putting it that way isn't edgy and cool!
964199,i am appauled that your wife can support such heinous game while taking part in the profound misogyny that is found in it.
964238,you could try rescuing the shark if it is still alive.
964258,oh thank **god** i was not the only one
964300,"yeah, because fuck those low elo players, they don't deserve a balanced game."
964374,"just some meta enforcement, but nevermind, as if riot would care about that"
964480,but... sega does what nintendon't.
964537,"yea, he learned a lot from a silver 2 guy..."
964547,this isn't on the front page or anything already
964587,so they would compromise the quality of their own product in another place to deal with the bad quality in another location... op is a fucking genius
964603,yeah man genja so noob too always plays ashe
964615,"yes, i do have a fast graphics card."
964720,only 90s kids will get this amirite?
964728,thank you so much for telling us what game this is.
964729,thanks for including the name of the game.
964741,but posting the video would just be a repost!
964755,common guys use the honor system.
964790,"no way dude, i love looking at picture of water levels"
964822,but then that would mean they have even more information about you...
964849,"don't be stupid, everyone knows i'm a challenger player but this trolls and stuff are the reason why i'm still at bronze."
964850,"no, they are just chilling letting people destroy the game they live of."
964867,i'm sure they want us to game with freedom!
964911,im still waiting on the day i have to go to the mall for my gf and get a autograph from gary coleman and on the way i can lit people on fire with my piss :o
964976,because nintendo would definitely develop a bloody game
964993,"wow thank you for posting this, i really wanted to know this"
964998,why spend any money on advertising when reddit posts are free?
965119,because it's totally easy to prepare those consoles every time you want to play and they definitely work easily with modern tvs.
965161,"if the relationship between dyrus and the rest of the team is one of talking to **your friends** and the dude alone at another table, then yeah, you might well be right."
965174,you guys are just jealous of the awesomeness that is wartune.
965197,obviously because there were a lot more choices
965353,"it's all good, once you complete rylai's his ganks are unstoppable."
965385,it's the only ability of his that hasn't had issues for being too strong so of course you don't
965386,because microsoft is clearly very concerned about sequential numbering.
965389,"i know, i mean look at how poorly the wii sold!"
965413,everyone knows slaves weren't people.
965529,yeah instead buy xbone for $499.
965550,^ps means buy playstation or what?
965564,"i wonder why you didn't talk about the other 2 cases, or give a link to your report card."
965589,i guess you didn't like the subtlety of it all
965633,"yeah, an ad carry with global initiate and infinite kiting abilities that makes lots of gold, why would anyone like that..."
965650,that's like saying the nazi flag represents uprising
965651,doesn't anyone remember how great of a game super rub a dub was!
965688,"based on what i've seen in movies and tv, i can confidently say that i believe it is."
965785,yeah we had no idea this happened to girls on xbl.
965799,"ought to give them a crack, they might do a better job!"
965882,"god, they're probably just gonna die anyway the little pricks."
965955,thanks for not making us look fucking awful.
966000,yeah because we are fully aware of all the dangers the tsa has actually prevented.
966003,i'm glad you realized na allstars was a signifier of skill rather than a popularity vote.
966042,yea the room and the previous doorway weren't riddled with explosives or anything.
966054,you fucking ocd bipolar piece of shit.
966157,"but it's a valve game, and that means that it's automatically golden hours!"
966173,really appreciate you removing my name from the bottom right corner.
966217,get your logic out of our hate circlejerk!
966226,but if one man/woman does something stupid it *must* be a reflection on every other!
966255,"good job on wasting time of microsoft support, im proud of you"
966271,"hey everyone this guy put hard effort into something and we are being critical, lets all downvote him while he defends himself"
966278,that's like... a *bajillion* ps1s!
966371,"sure it is, i see riot people posting here all the time."
966372,the ai in the splinter cell games have always been great.
966396,"oh no there is a bug in beta those idiots, how do they sleep at night?"
966426,but building stuff is an exploit
966437,because your choices are ruining america and killing babies and shit.
966470,"yes, and curriculum is a breeze..."
966477,it must suck for companies never to be able to expand because of this.
966611,"one time i enjoyed casually reading a gaming forum, then some fuck capitalized the first letter of every word and irritated the hell out of me."
966619,yeah reddit is where originality starts
966675,and they also have the best fps engine out there!
966709,"oh what a wonderful black and white world we live in, huh?"
966724,"no, i'm afraid i haven't a clue what you mean."
966756,"you should turn your graphics down, too powerful!"
966780,just make her bang out a couple ladder matches in scii and i'm sure she'll love videogames forever
966807,ea should give ~30% of there revenue to valve like all the good companies!
966812,"no, north america - south server makes much more sense"
966844,"no, this has no 'charm' and it's just not 'minecraft' and it's not 'cute' enough, also there's not enough squareness"
966868,that's definitely worth posting on this reddit.
966876,"cool now you will be able to trade all of that in and actually be able to get a mac, mac gaming is where its at ..."
966940,i'm sure we'll get some context on this insult.
966950,an overhealing shaman spamming healing rain bragging on reddit and hating on lfr... the internet has birthed original content and it shall be greatful for the fruits of your labours.
966966,because reddit is a secret club for only the cool kids who are already in the know.
966996,but the drama is so captivating
967046,"because teemo doesn't have enough skins, even with panda teemo coming out soon^tm"
967047,"no...he is right, if it is not in the app store it doesn't exist...yeah like there is a seedy underground app store for people running modded phones or something..."
967095,"yeah, that was such a great model and made recruitment, playing alts and swithching classes so much better!"
967132,"yes, lets be surprised that the new race is being played"
967149,"holy shit, i never realized that online shopping is cheaper."
967323,"beacuase steam is the bestest way of buying anything... if food would be sold on steam, i would stop buying food from regulear shoppas."
967388,"yeah a meme, which is what you just posted, is definitely related to the game and helps clean this subreddit"
967433,"yeah, i'm pretty ocd about that"
967441,well you know valve reuses many of the same sounds and models in many of their games so i guess all of their games must be shit too!
967450,i made a picture of my tail...wanna see it?
967475,"because all of his smurfs are at silver/gold, and not diamond 1 75 lp."
967479,"yes, because the scope of the game and all of the graphics would have stayed exactly the same as if it was developed for the 360."
967497,"they should also take away the ability to negate such damage with trynd's ult, kayle's ult, and zhonya's."
967512,meanwhile i dont have to worry if my gpu runs battlefield or not on ps4
967523,hopefully ezreal he needs more skins or graves
967535,"sure, man, that's why rp servers are so popular"
967556,"that makes a lot of sense, always look for what's worst for your enemies instead of what's best for you."

995806,"oh it's only got an xbox 360 in it, heat shouldn't be a problem at all"
995861,looks like they need to go f2p to stay alive.
995893,"yeah fuck asia, it's not like they have any chance of winning anyway."
995897,silly europeans and your thirty months
995910,"not totally, he used a texture pack"
995924,we definitely need more passiveness.
995966,"also, some fool put the keys for backwards and forwards literally right on top of each other."
995986,"wow, this has not been suggested 100 times!"
995996,"it does actually, as a sheer cliff."
996021,"oh yeah, i forgot we're talking about not giving riot any money because they're literally hitler!"
996077,"yeah, because vista sucked big time."
996126,but what if you want to refund your refund credits?
996130,leave it to vodka to make such a big deal over faction changing!
996138,"as i remember it people were stopped from leveling as fast as they could by it, which as we all know is a crime"
996164,"meh, 30 answers are enough, central limit theorem brah."
996172,yeah because girls are stupid and don't know how to google
996265,"way to copy building packs, you're incredibly talented"
996274,"shut up minecraft is a bug free game, all bugs are now features."
996316,"great, more things for me to buy and forget to use the active on."
996374,they will instantly hate jesus.
996379,all hail the glorious pc gaming master race!
996447,"yes, and there is no possible bleed over from developing physics like this."
996491,"man that's awesome, while supaboy guy plays his hundred or so awesome snes games you can play the 10 or so good games that ever came out for the n64... oh unless they need a d-pad!"
996514,still makes more sense then resident evil
996533,good to see the new rules are providing such insightful top posts on r/wow
996569,"yeah, it is completely and utterly impossible to role play in skyrim at all."
996627,i vote for having more things that people don't want just to add variety.
996646,why would you want to play through a bunch of liberal propaganda?
996657,fact: you must be a blast at parties.
996661,"don't worry, i get confused by background images as well sometimes."
996672,"i get it, it's cause atms give us money (resources) and so doing mining..."
996700,only if you preorder from gamestop
996708,we should start an internet petition!
996799,can't wait for the app to come out for the [insert apple portable device] so i can enjoy this like the rest of you.
996932,"i don't like sensationalism, that's why i go to reddit!"
997002,amazing what you can do with just a little protein and a good diet.
997026,"oh, it's just that simple is it?"
997133,"never would have figured that out on my own, thanks for your help."
997176,why would anyone play with less than a 3k machine anyway?
997193,"um, the only things in the cerberus network dlc are: * zaeed, companion + 1 mission * normandy crash site, 1 mission * hammerhead vehicle + 4-5 missions for it * an extra shotgun, an extra armor, an extra heavy weapon so yes, forget about the entire 40-50 hour game over one (of 13) character, six missions and three pieces of equipment."
997220,"smoking medical marijuana probably, those slobs!"
997232,"of course, that leaked copy totally ruined the sales of half life 2."
997476,"wow you sure nailed it, we girls just love to gossip and anything related to reading, typing, roleplaying or using imagination is boy stuff!"
997508,because posts are reddit really are going to change anything
997534,this is definately the response they were looking for.
997571,wow thats so generous coming from a greedy company
997606,"stfu bitch (by bitch i didn't literally mean you, but clearly there are many bitches around somewhere that need to shut the fuck up.)"
997687,makes sense it's cheaper that way
997846,i guess that's the reason why games like 'little big planet' and 'modnation racers' sold so poorly...
997937,though it is absolutely necessary for them to be involved in the lives of everyone elses children.
997973,just ban every character that isn't squishy or has cc.
998013,yes because steam controls where games they've never made get sold
998147,"starcraft 64 was amazing to play on the n64, so much better than on pc."
998174,"damn, i sure feel safer knowing those six plants can no longer hurt anyone."
998183,the truth is that mw2 is obviously a remake of doom with updated graphics.
998220,concrete evidence that video games encourage violence in our youth.
998277,the scout in counterstrike is basically a .22
998297,each map could be one of the randomly selected paintings so that we have to place and remove the painting several times until it shows the map we want.
998541,well... i mean invisible people and chunk loading errors that show you someone's base aren't that bad are they?
998560,"yeah, because the wii is a comparable piece of hardware."
998565,that's because they have to store different copies for each customer and storage space is very expensive!
998602,i'm sure making all of that information public did a lot to help expose security holes.
998603,"because that's working out really fucking well for the actual riaa, right?"
998608,"yeah, the zelda series had friggin terrible storylines."
998646,"whatever, piracy only exists because of shitty drm"
998695,irl we have guns why not in minecraft?
998752,"but, but , but, how will we compare e-peens now?"
998766,"but guys, ferals were too hard to control."
998768,"yes, they have treated us well with modding tools and custom server support for crysis 2."
998795,"yes, it's shocking people care about the game that they paid for and that they play and want the bugs that crash the client fixed, i'm damn shocked... those... those... those ingrate bastards!"
998818,"right, with games getting more realistic and with more minimal ui and better graphics all the time, this makes perfect sense"
998836,"hi i know it's like 3 hours later and i see 40 comments already but i'm not going to read anything to see if the games are gone, so i'll just ask that you give me free shit anyway."
998949,"rhythm games are all about tme micro, am i rite"
999072,the portal groupies aren't wearing this stuff out at all.
999075,"yes, i hear dreamweaver runs great through wine!"
999086,says the single guy who cries himself to sleep
999111,yeah i miss all those older street fighter games with unlockable costumes
999237,"shut up with your logic, clearly i should be able to 1vs1 any lane combo with my favorite champ!"
999294,wow they really started out strong with this one!
999339,this is a fairly typical build of most americans.
999348,"yeah, who the fuck likes gravity?"
999479,"i have a great idea, how about a loading screen?"
999495,great... just got off the crack and now i'm addicted again!
999587,a game about a society which doesn't have problems wouldn't ever sell.
999676,but minecraft still looked all 8bit
999695,"no, it's only okay if it's the other way around."
999722,great story... changed my life.
999723,cool i was needing a serial for that game.
999861,"i know, if only it wasn't such a rare block."
999865,profession: politicics what sort of position is that?
999889,and modern warfare 3 will be last the last call of duty.
1000198,but now i can leverage his passive!
1000242,it's too bad there aren't that many female characters for her to choose from.
1000247,"yeah, paying around $10 to alpha / beta test a game never worked as a model."
1000264,"no, neither of them can even hold a candle to donkey kong country 3."
1000275,"man, i wish i had a personal game company to pander to my every whim for a game i didn't pay them to make."
1000287,wow thank god that's a weight off my mind
1000312,"oh yeah, garen definitely needs a nerf."
1000317,"right, because valve totally forced people to buy the games."
1000337,"just like 95 percent of pc gamers pirate games, because they can right?"
1000352,"yeah, there's none of that dear notch, [random bullshit idea] stuff in *our* community!"
1000470,"yeah, cod:mw2 is lame compared to this"
1000512,hmm.. i have never seen this before.
1000516,cultivating marijuana is a criminal offense.
1000555,you've obviously never been to california!
1000565,this is terrible.. you're depriving them of sales of their cds!
1000640,good thing then that you will be invited to 10 different guilds within one hour of playing!
1000656,"yes because his problem was hard drive space, not bandwidth."
1000670,"yeah, i totally got this line from clerks ii."
1000718,it's funny because i remember seeing the same thing when people were talking about awesome games for the wii u
1000732,"getting on top of the scoreboard, obviously."
1000733,"because the rest of the series had auction houses with real money, right?"
1000745,you mean that for a fair judgement it takes more?
1000747,"it's because they are scared, not because he comes off as a douche writing in all caps...bro."
1000753,yeh that artwork is totally worth the extra money for a steelbook
1000951,"thinks for shutting off the lights, jackass."
1001077,"oh dang, i was hoping for another of notch's tweets, not a large and impressive structure that took long to make!"
1001083,hell yeah i hope they ban all this trash
1001273,oh yeah because sim city 4 was so good.
1001298,oh blizzard you are just full of surprises today
1001321,"don't worry they changed the management, everything will be fixed"
1001358,no they should ignore us and expect us to spend absurd amounts of $ on games with nothing we want.
1001363,that laser is so hard to comprehend.
1001443,"get some blue-rays, you will enjoy them more, derp"
1001449,no one could have predicted this!
1001493,yes because having money and playing games are equally fun
1001520,he was obviously a terrorist streaming terroristic ideas to fellow terrorists and how to commit terroristic acts.
1001529,"well this has never happened before in lol, i sure hope it doesn't become a regular thing"
1001535,"yeah, the last dubstep festival i went to was all nerdy internet guys on laptops, and absolutely not a sea of hot, nearly naked women."
1001565,"when i stared playing, i mentally made a note that if i ever lost a lane, it was because they were smurfing."
1001586,"well i just refuse to buy the game if someone, somewhere is paying less than i am."
1001611,blasphemy we must rage at everyone.
1001619,omg what will i do without my precious numpad?
1001999,**no you must blame them for all your own failures it is the way of lol**
1002024,lol games not scary i bench 280 and sex multiple women at once ur just a pussy
1002048,that seems like it will go over well.
1002054,"a video game score of 92 is equal to a movie score of about 50%, so i'd stay way from this one"
1002095,i expect a highly innovative title that redefines the fps genre.
1002106,"yeah, because, you know, it isn't like a wow expansion with new character / item models is coming out... yeah, no new races (models) or tier gear (items), nothing new."
1002108,yeh because i only play fps games
1002121,fucking asshole doing stupid shit like this instead of fixing the damn game!
1002138,"oh that's nice, i would love for notch to add 12 more ways for me to die just in time for the holidays!"
1002171,i am sure there were no tools involved.
1002184,yeah coz a *revelation* like that clearly destroys every memory you have of the game.
1002186,"as you get taller you get wider of course, just grab an xl"
1002254,i obviously meant games that were reddish in color!
1002283,because that helps him resell games...
1002329,having to move around at non-warp speeds is such a time shitter.
1002342,"quite unlike the ps3, wii, and xbox 360 games that don't have bugs, issues, or pirating."
1002380,i think half life sucks everyone loves it because they just want to be like everyone else.
1002381,hopefully this sort of imaginative thought is not being taken away from their quality programming.
1002404,but i was told that used games are lost sales!
1002405,iem china wasn't even all that big of a tournament
1002432,"it's fine if it bashes ea, right guys?"
1002457,"wow another mordekaiser pentakill, i never thought i'd see the day."
1002483,yeah man those awkward striking animations really indicate that the game has no merit whatsoever.
1002492,"yes, let's add things that will delay the release even more!"
1002493,"yeah, its not like he actually has skill or anything..."
1002508,"that wallpaper is my favorite, best pre-order bonus **ever**."
1002627,maybe because you're mindless nintendo fan boy.
1002791,obv they changed the seeds again
1002796,"-1 points, you should have closed with"
1002810,yes but he only deals half damage.
1002865,this isn't the 500th time i've seen this on here or anything
1002887,"well, then i still feel cheated, as i wanted to pay in negative amounts."
1002925,"yes, it feels good to have one less dk running around."
1002927,"when i beg for gold or free stuff in trade chat, but people just make fun of me rather than honor my request."
1002998,but...but...alpha is for features and beta is for bugfixes...
1003014,thank you for stating an argument as to why we should
1003076,thank god we have the eca to fight this kind of stuff for us.
1003112,"just proves the stereotype that video games make people violent, doesn't it?"
1003127,"yeah, and the mii was the first virtual representation of a person ever."
1003246,i'm pretty sure mw3 will hit that spot...
1003259,"because valve isn't a company that, like every other, values money above the customer."
1003264,"0/0 is clearly 1, i learned that in math class."
1003312,"yes, lets just move all the complaints to a spot no one can see them."
1003330,i think maki is mad that his teammates won't let him out of the 600 elo range because they feed so much
1003335,"yo man, sony is protecting your gaming experience from pirates and hackers, okay?"
1003353,i feel the same way about the dea and drug dealers...
1003356,but won't those special weapons they offer bring imbalance to the game
1003366,no lol pirate it's the only way to effect change
1003621,and you know he's classy since he left a freshly poured glass of wine on the table.
1003646,should have bought that protection!
1003692,"oh you are right, not buying this game at all, it fucking sucks"
1003804,"yes, because minecraft is noted for it's realism, and this has never been considered a bug."
1003831,"yeah, because they've got a real shortage of stone."
1003863,"or redditors need to click the link before they vote... no, you're right, sarcasm tag it is."
1003975,i thought it was the spelling errors in the post... unnaceptable and mostly likley
1004004,i want nothing to do with this game.
1004117,"downvoted, your boobs aren't hanging out and i don't see any duck lips"
1004184,so you...lay on the couch with your keyboard on your lap and your mouse goes where exactly?
1004448,they're *entitled* to their pirated games and cheathacks dammit!
1004469,i already miss links to games from the 90s and how much better battlefield is than call of duty
1004493,i don't think you caught on to the joke part so just for you:
1004524,"working full time, going to school, being a husband and a parent really get it the way of my wow time!"
1004553,"i prefer the shape of the '360 controller but i preffer the buttons and button layout of the dualshocks, also, you cant beat some good six-axis!"
1004569,"yeah, that's why people pirate."
1004595,yeah man i hate pulp fiction because he has that one line where he recites from the bible.
1004613,"yeah, because valve doesn't care about it's customers at all."
1004690,wow you guys played chrono trigger too?
1004735,some one should try this theory
1004816,notch should totally add higgs bosons!
1004851,"thanks bro, that totally wasn't intentional, you're a life-saver."
1004889,yeah just like those idiots who played starcraft before broodwar was released.
1004892,steam should follow this model and start charging for the client.
1004957,they definitely owe you access to the beta.
1004965,a game mode that actually rewards solid strategy over being super fed...that does sounds awful.
1004966,i can't believe you won with 5 people against 4 so fast
1004989,because no one has ever done this before!
1005004,ahahaha yeah good idea :) also that last bit was
1005018,but inappropriate name ruins games!
1005034,because completed items are better duh
1005039,i think it's time for ap yorick to rightfully take his throne.
1005041,"oh good, at least it looks nothing like the comic book"
1005053,but it's *cool* to hate on something popular!
1005060,"man, your friend can't draw homer simpson for shit!"
1005068,why is there a bottle of eyedrops in the right of the photo?
1005087,"yeah, i thought for sure there would be terrorists using small children as human shields and half the game would be about getting over ptsd after i was released from service."
1005259,brutallus was a great fight as a holy paladin
1005343,"i also live in the us, so i have no idea what that picture is supposed to be."
1005393,more mmos with everything instanced is exactly what the mmo world needs.
1005417,so there were no camps selected?
1005528,why not just give us a block for every type of redstone gate and make it so we barely need to build anything at all.
1005535,"yeah, microsoft has a spotless reputation when it comes to security"
1005554,thanks for the misogyny to start my day off right.
1005564,**consoles are call of duty are the death of gaming because i don't like either of them**
1005565,**they're going to ruin the game again**
1005582,"don't worry guys, it's fake because it's a facebook pic."
1005592,"i say, who let out those dirty console playing peasants?"
1005604,demons souls needed something to make it challenging
1005724,yep... all the women are responding very well to this man.
1005744,"agreed, i would much rather it look pretty for the five minutes it's running than look like shit while it runs for hours."
1005805,"yeah, they really need to get their shit together"
1005851,just like kate moss' career disintegrated when the photos of her doing cocaine were released.
1005888,im not upvoting because of jealousy issues.
1005903,"yeah, it's not the 3 gap closers + flash, it's not the ridiculous double-nuke that she can stack up twice in a short time frame... it's the tiny circle of invisibility that makes akali hard to deal with."
1005911,what is this and where does the disc go in?
1005922,they're also adding the dance studio!
1005924,"maybe niceness helps casuals, but when you play in the big leagues like me, being an asshole leads you to victory"
1005941,"they want to make money off dlc, you can't have the user base having it's way with it and making another desert combat."
1005955,another sign: not my fault my house looks like shit with the default
1006007,to know people who have played the game you have to have friends.
1006232,"kills don't matter, only tower kills, duh!"
1006258,ofc b/c ur not pro as him hes got fkcing fier lion 4 mount wat u got hmmm lol bronze drake gtfo ur not pro.
1006290,but the fact it has coop ruins my single player experience!
1006322,thanks for making a valuable contribution the discussion.
1006341,anyone know where i can get this game?
1006446,in this subreddit we don't post every little thing we want notch to implement.
1006451,"i, too, wish potentially life threatening bodily harm and loss of property upon this individual for downloading video games from the internet."
1006456,well if there is a lady involved i have to upvote.
1006508,oh wow that sounds about as fun as the first game!
1006518,i'm constantly surprised by how bankrupt steam is making valve
1006590,"because all girls suck at games, right?"
1006669,"oh no, he has been kicked a few times in untold hours of gameplay!"
1006677,looks real appealing after they play the mass effect 2 trailer...
1006742,"nah man, wasn't that ijustine segment awesome?"
1006775,"yes, i read through the whole thread after i saw this pic and posted my reply."
1006795,"yeah, it's not hidden if everybody knows how to make them."
1006849,"i mean, everyone knows battlefield has been riding on good graphics from day one, right?"
1006853,but you'd be destroying all the jobs in oblivion!
1007083,yes apparently we gained independence from britain in 1865 while fighting amongst ourselves.
1007170,"yes, because obviously your brain is connected to your computer."
1007208,but..but politicians need lots of money to get re-elected every 24 months
1007235,how can you not love that voice?
1007291,"i don't get it, is something different than usual?"
1007313,pc and ps3 are where its at for gamers... who woulda thunk it
1007383,this is a destruction of our freedom just because we attach it to a computer doesn't mean we're going to copy it thats it because of this i'm going to pirate forever and i'm plenty justified in doing so!
1007384,maybe the fan noise is dispersed by the boiling water
1007458,"if software is not allowed to run, is it really alive?"
1007485,bitching about it on reddit is gonna help.
1007498,well you need to know if they are 13 or a girl so you know what insults to throw out.
1007512,"yes, because m$ always has, until very recently, been more beholden to gaming than to their shareholders."
1007583,but then you don't get the ayn rand experience.
1007587,"damn, i already spent $15 on letting best buy install modern warfare 2 on my ps3 for me."
1007606,"for the record, blizzard is the first company to ever do micro transactions."
1007633,i swear to god it sounded like he ran out of breath at one point.
1007674,everything is better with a meme in it!
1007741,"that was my favorite part too; apparently if they're aren't properly dressed girls that match perfectly with their style of play, that means the game is trash and not worth playing... nice logic there"
1007757,we'll have none-o-that affront to the lord in hurr.
1008044,but now you can't be a karma whore
1008046,"yeah it really sucks having to push 2 buttons instead of 1 to play grand theft auto 4, don't do it, trust me."
1008080,this is what happens when you let people live on an island with no outside contact with the real world.
1008115,"men are the norm, best not to acknowledge women unless we're talking about deviations."
1008120,"i hope you scowl everytime you pass the 360 in your home, and after you play it, you look at yourself in the mirror with derision for half an hour."
1008237,but all my friends are playing it without me!
1008249,yea eve online is exactly like star fox 64.
1008266,i demand a retroactive m rating on frogger immediately.
1008319,"i disagree, i mantain that the library was by far the best gaming moment i have yet to encounter."
1008326,"come on, everyone knows that the arrows are best"
1008384,"yes, it's quite disgusting how all modern mainstream games are getting *so* complex, it's unbearable."
1008454,because fxiii was such a good game anyways
1008463,yeah i think after 5.5 years a month or two would of really made it all better.
1008469,your just jealous that your mommy wont let you play real manly games like cod you noob.
1008479,and it should be super simple to code!
1008516,"oh yeah, like everyone does that, or even cares."
1008526,that bucket in the middle of the bread could be a health hazard.
1008544,let us never speak of the past or else the gods might punish us.
1008721,uh... sounds totally *not gay*.
1008906,"you can get a new serial number for your game for the low, low, price of $69.99."
1009009,yeah but now bethesda won't know who made the mod and be able to give that person a job working on tes5!
1009015,fox news: nintendo discriminates against handicapped gamers
