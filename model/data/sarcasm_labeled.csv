this game seems like a shit copy of lucio ball imo,0
isai could be the best melee player in the world if he tried,0
"well, to be fair you did suck, you couldn't win 4v6, what are you some kind of noob?",0
it's already in dota so they wont implement it,0
nothing like a hard fought round where you win with less than 10 seconds left only to lose the next round in one single push,0
"well, if you're not shouting yar har fiddle de dee and bustin' caps with your offhand bb gun, and throwing cannon ball z are you *really* living the rogue dream?",0

"yeah, but he put it in quotes so it doesn't count.",0
"but muh na midlaner, he's just as good as all the imports, hes most consistent, he doesn't get carrried by the koreans",0
because there isn't totally a free level 100 boost for buying the game or anything,0
bjergsen and doublelift are the best players in the west by far,0
"yeah, because if there's a takeaway from this past weekend of games it's that perkz looks stronger than bjerg/double.",0

"no, he invests league money into other games, sub optimal owner.",0
nuke update ... almost forgot about this awesome addition,0
"oh that's why, it's on the ps4!",0
but brah everyone knows the reason why everyone isnt one tapping is due to first shot inaccuracy which sg barely has,0
but krepo should talk more about the free tower trade every game!,0
"yeah, because cod is always struggling for good sales.",0
shame you aren't a fan of a better game...,0
that guy that wants to gank for you until you're 0/3 at 6 mins and would only cause a double kill if he ganked at that point.,0

i'm a kass main since season 2 and i don't think he needs buffs,0
star wars battlefront 2 was released ten years ago!,0
"what, you didnt love the blatant cheating ai at higher difficulties?",0
yeah his waveclear is so bad for example and farming is so hard!,0
hey this is a our western kespa,0
cause item/entity duplication is a feature.,0

yeah but now youre gonna get autism and main mccree,0
"overwatch is currently only 20 tick, they need to update it to at least 64 tick to make it competitive.",0

"because they don't rush hat first, zyra, is that why?",0
braum cc lasts longer than ashe ult cd,0
assuming vac and overwatch actually work,0

i'm sure all the toxicity directed at such indivisuals will motivate them to do better in future games by practicing in the customs lobby.,0

tfw they added jungle timers last season and now people who don't have enough mechanics to have 6 timers running in their heads simultaneously have gotten to challenger because rito's making the game easy,0
"can confirm, balance breaking, inconsistent, accuracy bug makes 1.6 a better game",0
sometimes running accuracy can be a little ridiculous,0
but how can we win in pbe if all the op champs arent banned,0

dev1l and pyth so good rosterchanges kreygasm,1
yeah u are right better do nothing and keep losing,0
all those strategy games yet no strategy for your wallet.,0

"you don't understand, it won't split the community; everybody will play the superior big d queue to prove their true worth to the elo gods!",0
"thats it, everyone in mm that rapes me is using this cheat!",0

it bugged me so much that rengar didn't go ap :( too much power for one man to comprehend,0

"and making cortana voice commands exclusive for kinect its a dumb move, am i right guys?",0
"it was just over of their plan, now if they beat gambit they won't have to play fnatic in the quarters, and they can now get even more prize money if they reach semis",1
"yeah, his predictions is always on point..",0
i would pick the random button!,0

no casuals are allowed near my warcraft movie,0
"yeah, i always wondered why do i hear tsm chants when chinchongs are playing on stage.",0
he might actually finally reform after watching this...,0

"blizz (11/13/2014): omg guys wod is here, get pumped... yearly expansions are going to be amazing!",0
gotta love games that are decided in champ select,0

because lulu was the factor in todays games right?,0
"these type of knives have been banned by the geneva convention, so i doubt they'd put it in the game",0
"so get up get, get down, xbox live is a joke in yo town.",0
by the way things are looking there will only be 4 players.,0
it would be really good if you could use your trinket on someone like malphite and not allow him to use his ultimate on 10 secs,0
but developers said was super hard to do that when asked about ps4k,0
maybe casting in warcraft require both hands?,0
"yeah, about 3 years ago we adopted that rule and it has gone swimmingly so far.",0
"ah yes.. akali, the staple of high skill cap champions.",0
i guess it must be me because apparently windows phone has just as many great games as iphone and android that i've simply managed to miss over the course of two years...,0
nah men an xin with 1 attack speed item who clicks e q and your dead was super fun,0
it's because tsm lost and all their tsm marketing material for msi is wasted.,0
"no it's a joke, and a sarcasm is",0
doesn't count as a remaster if it's got the same graphics.,0
"no, all this mindless killing might make people not focus on the objectives and just lead to death matching",0
"yeah, but it's only about 99.9% science based",0
"every team uzi's in has some kind of drama, he's clearly the root of all problems",0
and just like that all my desires to pvp in legion vanish.,0
pretty bold if you ask me skt look pretty weak as does korea as a region,0
oh yeah riot games would never find out about that,0
why the fuck are you ordering chinese food you should get pizza like i am later tonight don't be such **trash**,0
"yeah, because building this in survival takes no effort.",0
"we don't need this, we have mario maker!",0
i think you guys all know more about who would be a better support for the team than the actual team themselves who know the game at an extremely higher level,0
na dude his probably just vaced from unreal tournament,0
"how could i possibly focus on the objective, when there's so much map to explore?",0
well yeah if they moved they might have lost that super important mastery bonus,0
"um, gta v has cars and tennis, so...",0
that would be confusing for new players though,0
"yeah, but you still agree onodera is best girl right?",0
adryh still stealing pay cheques,0
my eyes locks onto a girl's ass like flusha used to lock onto people thru walls,0
he saw that sweet hltv ranking and decided to ask for more,0
haha i thought i was the only one who noticed ;) cherry mx switches on the bomb confirmed,0
yes because that makes it perfectly okay.,0
games these days just can't keep up with true classics like black ops 2 and bf4.,0

at least they are giving a precise window,1
how's scream allowed to compete?,0
"brand does more with pillar of flame lvl 1, clearly brand is easy to play.",0
"nah, it'll be a 'games with gold' next month.",0
"yeah, all games are the problem, the cpu isn't.",0
because we all know how valve likes to drop updates on wednesdays,0
i see no way that this could be abused.,0
but what about all the deagle wallbangs i get?,0
"scripting, if he actually was scripting he wouldn't have lost his momentum at the last jump in kitchen, he also would have gained a lot more speed.",0
i love the fact you've been downvoted for stating a fact... i remember when reddit worked on the basis that the downvote button wasn't a disagree with someone's opinion button,0

spamming ranged attacks makes you so pro,0
at least he didn't say could of,0
the easy fix is to not do anything get you flamed,0
"personally, i find playing with friends and winning to be even more fun than one or the other, but maybe they disagree.",1
it must not be spoken about here,0

can they make it any more t sided?,0
the thooorin/adren banter would be fun.,1
"all bronze players are obviously held back by eachother, so they all deserve plat",0
ok since you brought the topic up i wanted to suggest some buffs for kindred: q :stuns for 2 sec (which is how much q needs to come back up with w on) w: gives passive attack speed (lets say 50%) and blinds every auto e: now stuns and after the proc it heals you for 500 hp at max level and has an ad scaling nuke with 500 base dmg (added to the % dmg) r: now only makes your team members unable to die and heals team members inside it to full health,0
just what everyone has been asking for - 2 more levels of valor!,0
if you don't let a bunch of immigrants a refugees come into your country and make it much worse your country is full of assholes...,0
we ain't all from florida or cali..,0

"yeah its easy, dev's just need to enter cl_optimize 1.",0
"oh man, what an important feature to be messed up by the dynamic queue.",0
yeah because the new ult has so much counterplay,0
you should have requested it the shape of a dorito for le epic maymays xd,0
"please make it for a 6300 champ, even better if i don't own it",0
and they say the community is toxic!,0
because when doublelift loses he's just some idiot adc,0
i hope its crimson elite (best skin in the game),1
"well, if it was within camera-shot of the kinect, the nsa has a copy of it...",0
it's great that a developer can rely on modders to do their work for them.,0
it would be sick to see when someone got an mvp for planting the bomb...,0
"dont say that shit here man inven will go bat shit on this and proceed to pummel na, eu and china scene in whole, calling rest of region as wild cards",0
i hope it tastes really good because the graphics look like something you'd see on a cake in 2008.,0
ea probably should've thrown more money at them for a better score.,0
"but he's lem, he knows better than that dmg scrub.",0
he must've got the new update early then,0
"no, you're supposed to make a claim and then provide zero proof cause",0
"drop him from the team, hes the worst player",0
but we don't need another content patch because of the faster expansion cycle,0
yeah because 1 minute of your life that you spend playing league and browsing the league subreddit is valuable,0
its better that you lose and the troll wins,0
obviously if it has better graphics it will influence them more,0
"no, it's always fun to lose bf sword to avarice blade",0

"yeah, one of them is showing enemy who is premade in your team",0
"germans obviously have the most efficiently coded hacks, otherwise they would be top",0
as we all know scims are serious business,0
so i'm sure soaz getting solo killed by adc as quinn when he initiated the fight by himself was team communication problem huh,0
well when i was 1-17 my system would shut down immediately at 23:00 so it's an efficient system.,0
yeah a virus specifically designed to try and wipe out 90% of the population as well as the city being fairly dangerous to walk around unless armed shouldn't mean that there aren't millions of npc's roaming the streets.,0
this is a helpful and informative response.,0
call of duty: why are you still playing,0
"yeah it's an every day avarage zed play, right?",0
i mean... he does have a tsm flair... :\^),0

"commented before you edited^lol^rip anyways, yeah he had his ping on 3fiddy",0
"that's right riot, buff ahri, she was at 52% winrate but it's not enough, she needs to be at 55%",0
because he has strategical mind and great tactical sense of the game,1
"yeah srsly, i don't get why you should get a ban for this ... i always write things like that and never got banned.",0
but in league we only get a 4% drop chance for gems!,0

"it must be you, the game is better than it ever has been before.",0
"what kind of idiot would want to transfer characters they have spent time and effort on, just make a new character you absolute noob",0
that emote totally doesn't fit her personality and the play of the game only focuses on the neck down.,0
maokai is a very balanced champion because his high base damage make up for low scaling and his lack of cc and survivability.,0
dont need official if its over twitter!,0
how about a mode where death timers are shortened and turrets are buffed,0
this is why *every* joke in this community needs a,0
that compensates for the 700 health per 4 spells lategame,0
"oh i'm sorry that i'm going against the circlejerk, please go on.",0
they'll be sure not to bias towards activision/blizzard titles.,0

good job valve i understand this statement probably did take 11 months to write!,0
yeah because the entirety of months of champion design is resting on reddit's shoulders,0
maybe his ult is now an aoe stun,1
"yeah, not like it's an industry worth billions of dollars",0
"you're right, a champion doing well in one of the millions of games played daily means they have 0 issues and are perfectly balanced because if they were truly weak they would never physically be able to do well ever.",0
good roster that will achieve alot in the scene!,1
nice fight between na midlaners!,0
"it's because you're a dirty, sweaty, tryhard.",0
it is useful for one's self-esteem,0
you forgot to say that your post is sponsored by alphadraft.,0
bc apparently as long as you're in eu you're automatically a better fit for any na team than any nacs player,0
and the other 50% are scandinavian or from cis,0
who cares about good teams when you can just buy a spot tbh,0
[what about using spoiler tags?],1

"because most people bother reading the manual before using a product, of course.",0
yeah other people afk so why can't i?,0
a sample size of 1 game is definitively enough to judge tsm.,0
that one vp vs ldlc game would like to talk to you,0
"there are no cheaters in cs, you are just playing against people who are better",0
hey bro the new ranking system isnt giving people there real ranks,0
because it is something new and well you know...people are afraid of changes.,0

"nonsense, not like you could carry some bronze shitter up to diamond with a 4man premade, no way",0

"player with 1700elo placed in bronze 3 cuz he lost a few games during the placements, having team with every border there is and all being below bronze 1, yea fun time",0
physically speaking a flip knife would be the smallest i guess.,0
look at those ugly tire treads...obviously not much has changed graphically from profesional farmer 2015.,0
other than that it is totally similar,0
it would probably go to ti6 prize pool.,0
yeah after s4 you were certainly going through hard times,0
yeah man bjergsen would've killed them both with auto attacks only,0
but the ps4 runs games at 4k 60 fps,0
"season 6 baby, victorious ao shin will be yours!",1
"yes, preferring to concentrate on reactionary spell casting, totems, pets, aoe rotation, maelstrom procs and cooldowns instead of having to do the same thing with an added and unnecessary resource management system is lazy.",0
tsm so good they infiltrate other regions' top 4 ^,0
i think the randomrambo kick from fpl is more important.,0
because presences make the game too hard,0
as tf main - it works as expected.,1
"because having the opposite opinion of the majority just means he's bad at the game, right?",0
yeah i don't deserve to take that much damage if i get hit with 20 skillshots in a row.,0

maybe they don't want to mix them up with the dota 2 team og?,0
omg he still lives at home with his 20 years what a loser,0
so instead of making proper sentences you make a giant paragraph and put all the unused periods at the end of it?,0
fucking pros smurfing as globals.,0
pretty surprised that's all you had to download when it's like 3 years worth of content,0
you're telling me they nerfed the wrong champion,0
it must gave been off-topic or factually wrong not because people disagree,0
we obviously need to worry about how other people are enjoying the event and whether we can hear them or not.,0
thankfully they removed local co-op in the latest halo so no one else will have to suffer through the hell you went through.,0
they do that just to keep in line with the worst na team,0
"yeah, let's all hail ubisoft titles now",0
found the person who got into beta,0
"or, and god forbid this is true, people from eu are allowed to like na teams and use their flair themselves.",0
but cops have to do this because these people are *dangerous* and going to kill people.,0
good use of that education you're paying for,0
you were aiming to high and didn't stop moving.,0
"i like farming under tower with swain, its so easy and fun!",0
nah i like it when paladins come and fuck all the mobs up then bubble and fly away like nothing happened,0

but he has like 10 friends so its a big sample size to come up with the conclusion,0
i didn't realize gpus weren't electronic.,0
i don't understand rumble has enhanced ap on his autos whenever i play him,0
wow i totally didn't expect so many nip fanboys,0
i absolutely can't wait to experience all of the ps3's aaa games re-remastered in brand new ultra hd!,0
turns out nip it still the best team ever,0
should've just used the panorama feature on the iphone,0
no it's because of first shot inaccuracy valvo plz fix,0
but reddit told me that the skin is shit because of the model!,0
"shhh, riot is the greatest company ever and you're just a hater for saying otherwise.",0
"well, reignover doesn't have mvp ability",0
what if thats what they intended it to be,0
a windows machine would definitely be better for running all of my unix applications,0
yeah 1-5 when everyone else on his team has similar scores is intentionally feeding,0
but then we won't get to listen to the ~~annoying~~ insightful eu vs na banter!,0
"sooo, just fire everybody from literally every other team and replace them with people for the soloq team.",0
fkin teammates always stealing muh frags,0

i appreciate your contribution to the discussion.,1
"can confirm, me has mechonix but bronze teammate drags me down",0
i'm sure they'd get banned from esl for serving adult beverages.,0
playstation now is the same thing as backwards compatibility!,0

til an organization name directly convert all of their players' skill into the org's primary game.,0
mods showing their hypocrisy once again with a shit post of their own...,0

"yea, hell why even teach history in schools no one needs that old history lesson to see how we have gotten to where we are today",0
i mean if you don't buy a whole new account to raf with or drag a friend into it and spend gold on xp pots you are clearly lazy and you shouldn't complain that leveling through tbc and wrath is a painful and boring process.,0
i think it will something along the line of a paladin will visit [tirion's grave and return the ashbringer to pay tribute to the fallen hero.],1
but sub numbers don't show if a game is healthily growing,0
guess i play with my gold friends in my master promos,0
but didn't you hear we can only see in 24fps ... or some shit like that,0

i for one am excited about all the new amiibos they're going to announce!,1
i've probably seen more nude body parts of lea than i saw my dad.,0

"yep, he got humiliated by no names cs players like poe and febiven in eu...",0
eco ace must be so amazing to be upvoted so much,0
polygon had it right: _her story_ is the real goty.,0
yeah but it's not clear in a teamfight,0
what do you expect from a game where every round is the exact same scenario?,0
"but ea has given people bad video game endings or charged people for dlc, would could possibly be worse than that?",0
"apparently we haven't had enough mini-games already, seing all the **positive** feedback for champions that redefine the game... *cough*",0
nip's line should sky rocket now that they have a new line up...,1

"im pretty sure he didnt hear him or anything, he mustve just used an aimbot...",0
"it might be an update for a map from the workshop... just a gut feeling, i have 0 evidence for it",0
yeah the game is rigged so there is more excitement from an eu vs brazilian team so it isn't a complete stomp,0
"that's hardline, it's stupid no matter what, get with the program.",0
"holy shit, i really hope you just forgot a",0
"yeah, but dynamic queue is the better experience",0
"thanks for nerfing the only defense we have against rengar, as small as it may be!",0
that's what you deserve for losing that 1 match,0

"because valve = good, ubisoft = bad.",0
it looked like all the terrorists were playing on xbox to me... (i don't say that k word so),0
"yeah, the millions in sales for fo4 is really making them think long and hard on where to take their series next",0
nooo nobody bothered to make 1000 of those since launch nope,0
welshes are cold-blooded killers.,0
because obviously the na teams are in cahoots with the government.,0
cause i'd rather watch lux perma ulting waves from base and raka perma healing to victory,0
"all dlc should be in the base game no exceptions, unless it's the witcher 3",0
"i was dmg before patch and im dmg now, what does that say about me?",0

"no, you see, clearly the question was written in invisible ink!",0
how dare they joke about performance enhancing drugs,0
grinding hot masteries in a zerg group is so social,0
not like they already have access to your computer at all since you have steam installed...,0
"yep this is a real drastic change, couldnt they have just tried a couple nerfs and buffs when the game was in close beta?",0
"i hear there is a jungle main ruining soloq, his name is hotguy6pack",0
"you got them, you just can't see them.",0
bug - check wonky animation - check it's probably fallout 4,0
no sense arguing when riven has an 85% win rate and 100% pick/ban in the world's tournament that just concluded.,0

"didn't pulverize and then flash, shitty ass play, downvoted.",0
"it's a waste, you can only see 30 fps, 15 fps each eye.",0
source 2 will fix this for sure,0
better hire thousands of peoples to reply to every single support ticket one by one right ?,0
poppy has a low cd max health damage scaling on ap while building ad fucking broken,0
i'm sure a dmg can teach everyone how to get better at headshots.,0
my uncle who works at nintendo says they will,0
"right, those fuckers need to go through the work of stealing a country from the natives",0
but i don't want to react to the game at but also i want to win every game can you just please nerf everyone except my favorite champ to make this easier on me?,0
why didn't fnatic just let vuggo play at the end?,0
many eu players are jealous of the higher skill level in na which results in banter like this.,0
but there is no sex appeal in dota,0
"i don't even play yi, i just have this flair cause i'm too lazy to change it.",0
"yeah, let's screw over splitpushers again because that was so fun the last time we did it",0
"yeah, there are so many male protagonists that doesn't apply to at all.",0
this wouldn't have happened if they all had guns.,0
i could be challenger if my teammates werent holding me back,0
dude viktor was broken unlike rageblade,0
"you can't, you basicly 1v5 or lose, when you pick fiora you need to carry your team because thats why you picked her",0
would be nice for terrorists to communicate,0
but not as forced as anders casting,0
ask me for my stream so i can post it here,1
"well it's obvious, you didn't turn your hacks off before recording we can see his outline",0
i didn't know tom hanks liked warhammer,0
i've always wanted to spend almost 2 hours watching teams play only to end the same way it started,0
throwbinds deserves vac and 25 to life,0
looks like faceit 128 tik.. so ez shot,0
what you don't like the new s76 akin with a biker helmet on?,0
i still think it's nice they added zeratul to the sc games after his debut in heroes of the storm,1
"wait, you didnt accept exposure as an adequate form of compensation?",0
"he's 100% serial, i can tell by the lack of",0
"and all of a sudden, queue times increased by 10 minutes worldwide.",0
still better than virtus.premier,0
wow i played with that guy too what a coincidence :ooo,0
til that sonic the hedgehog is an oversexualised female character.,0
"yes, because clearly the majority of people play in dia+.",0
"no, i think it's a different engine.",0
"you mean like the oculus-exclusive lucky's tale, which was give a glorious 5/10 by gamespot?",0
"game is totally different now, crosshair placement is irrelevant in the new meta",0
"hey, at least zombie was a aaa game just a few years ago",0
"maybe they should move him to the coach position after this major, seems like he would do better there",0
"ye its so easy to get ahead of quinn,graves, naut or any s tier tank as olaf",0
pushing him down a set of stairs would be a good way of disabling him,0
"gj, you not only came of as a passive aggressive douche, you also managed to act conceited and childish at the same time, quite the accomplishment",0
"no, it's totally not unethical to accept gifts before reviewing products.",0
"736 ilvl is pathetic, i don't blame them",0
he is faster than her and has iceborne.,0
"but aoe kayle ult is op, i don't care about it's cooldown, radius, duration, mana cost, range and the delay!",0
enchantment shaman sounds interesting.,1
she's a bad support because she's meant to be a burst mage with lich bane.,0
but if you're an asshole to someone you think is an asshole too it's justified,0
"since tanks were complete trash before the juggernaut patch, right?",0
"how could it be vac secured, he is clearly cheating",0
maybe nintendo will learn from how many they're making and will start making more than 6 of each amiibo.,0
"yeah, because everyone is going to pax east",0
stop being so sexist if she was a guy you wouldn't be saying that,0
bdd showing he can solokill faker 4 times in a game!,0
god forbid they implement something like a spinning wheel like every other video game has on loading screens to let us know the game isn't frozen.,0
in true riot fashion you'll get chat restricted and banned for 1 week.,0
it's so broken nami should be disabled,0
"quality post man, a lot of effort you put into it i can see.",0
but its your fault for taking 1 step away from your tower,0
damn quite expensive no wonder dreamhack 'fixed' the semis for nip,0
with your complementary metric system,0
no queue like for lfr because nobody is going to run a raid after two years,0
because inferno is just that balanced,0
no dude it's getting fucked so brutishly that i'm gonna feel it for years.,0
out of range you mean leave the map right.,0
yeah i'm not giving up years of unperfected bhops either,0
"i'm going to make it out one day, but 100% of my teammates are bronze... so they're holding me back",0
yeah cause what this game needs is rng in the neutral objectives...,0
itt: liquid pays s1mple to boost them to a legendary spot in the major,0
yea that ratchet and clank one was sooo bad!,0
but that's not what us .3 delta version ex cal-o pros use.,0
because he keeps finding out his teams are a bunch of boosted animals.,0
"ah yes more veigar nerfs, exactly what he needs",0
"yes, everyone working at riot had shitty parents and that's why you're not getting what you want",0
should be much better to let you 1v3 mid huh,0
"ye man, because typing status in cs console is only a 50% way lol",0
correcting mistakes is a little bit worse.,0
man it's almost like the ps4 is just a second-rate pc in disguise or something.,0
that sounds nothing like dark souls!,0
that's why edge browser doesn't have them yet!,0
i guess nerfing udyr like 20 times along with runic echoes was a good idea,0
likely more popular than poro king,0
"they aren't ignoring it, they're celebrating it with the release of the highly anticipated metroid prime federation force, which has been in development for 7 years, so it must be amazing!",0
"yeh, once this hits the front page, tyler's following will 100% disappear!",0
nothing wrong with valves patch and map policy,0
"it's ok, they're fixing that in legion",1
"yes, let's learn say smokes for a map which is exiting the mappool.",0
rip all the karma for this post,0
guys... but we can't know he's hacking since there is no vac ban...and no witch hunting either,0
this game is obviously the same exact game that activision's been re-releasing since 2007,0
"but, but... 2001 was only 15 years ago!",0
"sure, lets cater reddit to your needs!",0
why would we implement talking orbs in csgo?,0
"fix azir bugs, give him knockback on e, revert his w range nerf, thank you.",0
more like star wars battlefield am i right?,0
maybe stattrak for each colours too!,1
but pcmasterrace... consoles are shit right?,0
"you know a website is a good, reliable source of information when it has titles such as: ''ipad pro vs ipad air 2 vs ipad mini 4: who da boss?''",0
"volvo confirmed, skins = integrity of the game",0
i feel like using a clip where steel was smurfing was much more important.,0
yes im sure top european teams will stop playing and earning big money because ibp got permanent bans for matchfixing,0
"that's what they said last year, maybe thus will finally be the year!",0
yes because we all support ibp.,0
"i don't think you understand, vayne has a lot of stealth and mobility",0
"ahh yes, because sitting in front of tv is widely accepted.",0
yeap... the percantage will drop so hard if you do this... from 0% to 0% .,0
"chelsea is a mid table team tho, i kind of expect it from them.",0
how is this situation still pleasant :/,0
i can't wait for all those psp+ vr indie titles,0
"hey, at least **you** offered a constructive third option, without that we'd be stuck with shitty dynamic queues.",0
great to see brainless mobile games on the xbox one...,0
:) :) :) :) :) xd :d lol lololol ;) ;) &lt;:) not a scam -every scammer ever,0
but where else can i talk about my skates and blops and other games i want on bc like skyrim,0
then how does every child i see with a st vanilla karambit say they unboxed that shit?,0
then you don't buy a 50$ rp card,0
yes the game is totally unplayable if tick is set at 20.,0
personally i'm waiting for golden abyss 2.,1
it is not pornographic if it is educational or arts!,0
"yeah, this picture really shows his computers capabilities",0
i guess that's why it was a roaring success.,0
oh yeah wt had no impact what soever,0
wow we haven't seen this one before,0
oh they simply must i would be ever so sad if they didn't,0
"ye but when flusha did it he only did it for publicity not because he cared, not like fallen",0
how dare you make sensible counter suggestions to a champ that's clearly op?,0
"well, why are they not a 2/3 anymore, that's where the heart comes from!",0
i hear he just picks up his mouse a lot more then normal,0
"it's just a bunch of numbers, how hard can it be?",0
"an extremely beginner friendly game is *dark souls*, it should be a breeze.",0
this is why hades wont ever be on a top na team,0

"send it to me, and i will take care of it",1
"if your ancestors are from indian subcontinent, i think is quite ok in terms of playing videogames",0
gotta slip in your true rank somewhere of course.,0
yeah i bet they're pretty short on cash,0
"nah, spending 100k on semphis and fns makes more sense...",0
this me is having some sick wr on this subreddit,1
"nobody would tell lies like that on the internet, what would be the purpose!",0
nah riot would never do something like this,0
"because amazon accounts are rare and valuable commodities and every single one has already been created; not like you can make another account or anything, right?",0
ya my buddy did some voice acting for it too!,1
that guy pushing from palace was global before update,0
"casting alone don't bring in enough of that skrilla, everyone knows that",0
"played beta, mouse clicks don't register in menu and sometimes don't fire, clearly they designed this for pc.",0
yeah cause video games turn kids into violent criminals because they played a game on their xbox.,0
but tahm was more of a problem than udyr!~!~,0
these guys are asking the hard questions!,0
"no, any code that doesn't work the way the end user expects is spagetti code.",0
ofc not you just don't understand anything about the game you filthy redditor,0
"this is reddit, it's not a repost because at least one person has not seen this before...",0
"or everything would be so broken, that nothing would be broken",0
"ofc it's intended, riot wants you to use 3rd party sites.",0

"yeah, wales is ocean fish giant",0
"pfft, i guess it doesn't even matter then",0
"but dude, i'm not getting paid to smurf/call lower ranks bad, so it's totally ok for me to ruin 5 other players' fun.",0
brb buying 100 hoping valve does this,0
no sandbox mode to be toxic with so i guess just link the player advice boards to anyone who has a rough game.,0
maybe they see my sick bhops and realise that i spent all my time on kz maps,1
"they're making the assumption that black/white didn't get a 3rd version, and then they added black2/white2 in to that list, because they apparently are two separate games... makes complete sense!",0
"thanks for this post, i've never seen anything like it before.",1
"nope, doesn't matter if they so different things and are different champs.",0
"oh yeah, i forgot the laws are always right",0
"what the hell, 0 fps on these pc pic's consoles are so much better than pc!",0

so why are there more than 151?,0
"but everything has to look like a michael bay movie nowadays ... more effects and explosions please, need rocket launcher asap",0
what do you even do in this game?,0
will probably still use gamebryo and the creation engine,0
but halo 2 had super advanced graphics that only vista would be able to support,0
obviously on frontpage already if it was the man the myth the shroud himself.,0
"how dare you support toyota, clearly suzuki is the better brand and your opinion is invalid.",0
my friend and i* guess you spent too much time watching others and not paying attention.,0
he should go to a bullying seminar and maybe he'll be fixed,0
the rest of the 98% got 74 points,0
"yeah, have them watch tv instead!",0
has everyone registered with geforce to received your e-mail driver updates yet?,0
ye koo rich org and have alot sponsors,0

"couldn't agree with you and your downvotes more, sir or ma'am",0
welcome to reddit where trolls still exist and dont know how to,0
luckily no one has smurfs for boosting up their friends.,0
surely that would help against toxicity.,0
"the only side that needs proof is the one that contradicts your opinion, man.",0
so by every one logic nasus passive is broken because it helps him sustain,0
im sure the battlefront subreddit will love that,0
that's what you get for playing a male draenei,0
"oh well probably forgot, surely nobody will abuse this",0
shaman still have to manage tidal waves yay,0
you must be fun at parties then.,0
"call of dooty is sthoopid, it's the same ting over and over again, i'm gonna go play the new mario now",0

"because redditors hold themselves to a higher moral and value, right?",0
"another quality tournament with top tier teams, yay!",0
can't wait for this to come out and they lower the graphics!,0
it would look like an indie game,0
"against the rules to unplug your own pc, nothing against paying people to do it for you.",0
so brave posting something about gun control on reddit.,0
because reddit is totally representative of all the players in league.,0
yes that's why the players wanted to keep him and decided to keep working with him.,0
"oh no, how can i enjoy watching someone else play without being able to see their masteries",0
but ur on fnatic which is way better,0
you can really feel the passion dig players have for the game.,1
oh yeah dude cos travelling is totally the same as exploring a post-nuclear wasteland in virtual reality in the comfort of your own home.,0
"yeah shotcalling is irrelevant, only need individual skill like lgd...",0
yes because pro csgo players are such high value targets.,0
finally only valve would know that i play the newest dove dating sim,0
by that logic china should be the best region,0
yea the game is much more fun if every champion is the same in regards to what their kits do.,0
"he understands the value of cover fire, some thing these kids not growing up in real war environments don't.",0
i mean he his flair is global so...,0
we are lucky that thooorin/monte told loco that kasing wasn't the main shotcaller on his team.,0
he played well for a few days so clearly he is the best mid na.,0
obviously you start cull on nasus for that sweet gold,0
i'm sure if microsoft comes up with something pc gamers don't like they'll pay close attention and never repeat their mistakes.,0
valve y u no unban swag deserve unban plzplzplzplzplzplzplz volvo plz swag did not rong he was advantaged plz,0
delior and fnatic can turn any player into the best guysss,0

fuck you for thinking that meme is still funny,0
"loses to the team who got 3-0'd by skt, yeah we'd win the entire thing",0
"you deserved this, this is just as oppressive as telling people irl what to do or youll troll and feed",0
"nah, fiora is perfectly fine, she needs at least 5 q/passive procs to kill a 400 armor rammus",0
thresh should not be able to hook people as well!,0
"also, the asus has a crosshair overlay function which makes it perfect for awp noscopes...absolute must have for faze clan members",1
"eh, it will probably be removed before it comes to euw",0
"nice tips dude, i'm sure they will help to decrease rammus's 54% winrate in solo queue as a top laner",0

"yeah, with some kind of 3-hit passive",0
"oh, i forgot you could fly in raids.",0
he probably just has $5k headphones.,0
because it takes more than a lunch break to write a couple lines of code,0
because this is totally a power ranking and not a for fun elo comparison,0
"yeah, bhopping totally isn't useful in any situation ever",0
"while we're at it we should give the ak a scope too, and 100% accuracy when spraying.",0
since na west coast ping gets worse they must compensate it on euw.,0
just cuz he got vac banned doesn't mean he's a cheater,0
haha while you're at it add kill streaks and rpgs!,0
"no he's obviously cheating, see i'm eagle and i know if a pro is cheating.",0
maybe his body just need that adderall afterall?,0
"yeah, they looked awful compared to that high skill matchup between uol and h2k earlier.",0
"shh don't tell the pvpers, they'll expect real content or something",0
"because having a 2k+ health ally in the form of dragon, for no particular reason, doesn't count as an advantage when seigeing towers.",0
i'm diamond too but it's pretty hard to carry as adc in silver without another smurf,0
"just take flash/cleanse, that's clear counterplay right there",0
obviously because the servers moved from chicago to new york.,0
which means he's a liar and just recorded nasty ps4 footage,0
"na man, adc is totally fine right now just kite lawl",0
"he was right, it gives you no damage.",0
she sure is dating him for his personality and looks.,0
"yeah i guess, useless gaming armor + useless arrow.",0
they are just hiding and preparing the source 2 launch at pax like that one guy said,0
we already got the shitty smgs and pistols,0
but they are continuations of established game series and not nearly as good as the remakes and sequels on ps4 and xbone,0
kill your xbox or playstation wii-like gaming capabilities because everyone knows the wii is the best selling console of all time,0
because clg has never had confidence issues especially when the games really matter.,0
"you're right, i cant understand any of the words when its used!",0
yea and casters get 1000+ ap late game when i get 5xx ad whats up with that i want my 1000 ad on zed or vayne,0

ye dyrus should afk and be in fountain,0
yeah obivously the teams at those international competitions were the best teams in the world,0
"shouldn't have dropped scream, hs% in titan at a silver level now.",0
know what since a awp deals damage relatively quickly you should just hold that one out,0
"don't believe this guy, i just tried and it still didn't work.",0
noob tube attachments for every gun,0
but he can pick vayne and then it's like double was there,0
"yeah cheaters, douchebags, throwers are great - more drama more soul and fun",0
should have been at fountain first 10 mins of game obviously,0
"yes, because pokemon needs to never graphically evolve with the times and just cater directly to 90's kid nostalgia.",0
well that's the only reason i'm losing every once in awhile!,0
"yeah, we should also blame cdpr, totally, because it doesn't cost any money, time and manpower to implement another hair physics system.",0

i thought everyone in this sub reddit was already challenger,0

down voted because idk what you are.,0
"yes, that isn't a massive oversimplification made by a fanboy at all.",0
"yeah, why cant people just deal with cancer, right, stop being sad about it",0
but.. what about that sweet advertising for a game you already own digitally?,0
so does this mean steve is coming to smash?,0
"yeap, just like the sc community did.",0
i would be top-tier too but its my teammates fault that im bronze 5,0
"people are getting fucked over but their not me and i don't know them, so i don't give a fuck!",0
but european football is midweek,0
"that's why they shifted ranks, now the formerly gn4 devs are probably like lem, problem solved!",0
i'm sure riot sat down and said how are we going to screw eu lcs this season,0
"but it's *japanese*... that alone should make you ejaculate, right?",0
"haven't you heard, they just did!",0
"yeah valve, which is who we're talking about here, really fucked payday 2",0
"clearly this is a well written and edited article, it's from forbes!",0

"you just gotta commit, max e and go runeglaive",1
everything after cod4 was a step in the wrong direction,0
yes because the 1st thing i do when i break electricals is take it to my wine specialist.,0
the loss of the mana potion was indeed devastating,0
change title to cod looking cache because it actually looks like it came from a cod trailer or something (with cs player models of course),0
wow you're obviously trying to show off your skins,0

and of course he's made no improvement in play in the several months it's been since then.,0
tf rework to have spider solitaire passive?,0
but ... the game would be perfectly balanced and the toxicity gone !,0
"yes dude, better put a hard doublelift penta!",0
why don't you just win the custom then ?,0
"i don't like sivir spell shield either, let's remove it.",0
i agree lets bring back the meta where only 5 guns in the game are useful,0
strange that an official frozen game would be such a mediocer port,0
your neeks bruv hahaha lowe it you pagans.,0
he also made a series of games called dark souls,0
what are you talking about adcs are so weak and useless and can't win games in this meta.,0
"yeah man a 5v5 team game should be way more focused on individuality, just like any other team sport!",0

90% of the players are people idling for shadow cases,0
"cause no one on gears uses mics, duh",0

ahh the side of the community that makes it what it is.,0
"what are you saying, sbenu vs im games were always such high quality matches.",0
this wouldn't happen with a 144/hz monitor,0
no way dude it's the end of the world we are half way into group stages get real,0
why not just undo the french shuffle and use titan?,0
but adcs are only picked because of their utility these days,0
"we lost, but we were the strongest, obviously",0
"no, natosaphix and daboo are the real top tier casters.",0
yeah definitively specially in korea in asia where drugs is extremly not well viewed,0
haha or saying some really bad word like.. i almost can't type it ... fuck,0
"yea, the game will seem too unrealistic now because of the delorean...",0
there was a exploit were greater stealth trinket made people win more by seeing in the fog of war.,0
"clearly i'm some sort of super human then, considering i can easily spot the difference between 30 and 144 fps when playing league(i have a 144hz monitor)",0
"after 1000 auto attacks, thats 3000 damage difference.. thats pretty damn big difference man.",0
o ye at least i use real guns skurblord,0

"he's just a tall dwarf, you racist fuck.",0
i mean obviously we can see that you have a massive amount of respect for imp,0
looks like he hit his aim key to check if anyone was in tuns.,0
how about using 1:2 resolution?,0
i guess reddit doesn't like sarcasm.,0
he doesn't seem to have too much trust in his team.,0
so what you are essentially saying is this could be bethesda's work?,0
"that is a bit overkill jesus, maybe their pc's should explode as well",0
clg just using all 30 rounds to get some extra practice before the real important matches,0
it's apparently an unknown feature that no one uses...,0
they're playing so good ska doesn't even have to move from spawn,0
less da's and be's but a few more di's,0
:thumbs_up: clearly you're in the preview program for all the right reasons.,0
just totally amazes me that someone would spend their time on the internet lying to people!,0
good to see blizzard is tackling the gold inflation problem.,0
imaqtpie already explained it why..,0
which is why balls was stuck in d2.,0
we all know that everyone in cs:go is a smurfing hacking cheater noob.,0
cause bitching about things works better then trying to actually do something!,0
"only 250k $ up for grabs, let's just skip it boysss",0
"they should all get a participation medal for playing, so nobody feels like a loser.",0
"i think nazis did nothing wrong, cuz hitler brought the plans to their minds.",0
"yes lol.. he has the newest aimbot that aims just in front of the enemy and then around him, to make it less obvious.",0
"but they need to make a gui in bios to do that, its too risky.",0
yeah and it's literally impossible for clg to make an offer that jack would accept.,0
oh man you got him so good you are the king of burns,1
i am sure the circlejerk is totally worthy of determining that.,0
envyus -happy +ex6tenz top 1 hltv confirmed,0

"no he could just see where they were due to being in obvious spots, team is just bad against a good player",0
"nah, i'm sure that pulling the plug on their only game for 4-6 months wouldn't hurt their playerbase, revenues or their reputation in the slightest.",0
maybe this will finally make syndra meta again,1
"but fnatic went 3-2 versus skt so clearly this random ass fnatic fan knows what they're talking about, right?",0
"yeah, we'll totally stop getting ea and ubi games, you're so right.",0
maybe the technology just isn't there yet...,0
"yeah, who doesn't love getting his ears raped.",0
shhh yes insightful comment i'm now more knowledgeable as to why the community and you wouldn't want this thank you for your detailed explanation,0
i don't think the gba is region locked so you should just learn japanese,0
"yeah, 4 of the team members dying from damage by a single midlaner is not important",0
yup not at all he needs a death cap passive instead of the chalice.,0
wow i bet they never thought of that,0
not to mention it only sold for just under 24 dollars.,0
maybe we should set quotas and hire based on gender instead of ability,0
"because it runs better on ps3 already, no need",0
that must be why na is so horrible!,0
"but then you still have to run through like, 10 whole mobs!",0
"i know, 3600 points and 90% upvotes: op is on the floor",0
but my view on life really has changed,0
yes because which videogame gets remastered is a matter of grave importance and popularity shouldn't factor into business decisions.,0
but who plays games for the story?,0
wow he cheated in a tournament 9 years ago he sounds like a terrible person.,0
oh so no one noticed the implied,0
that's highly unlikely unless you're challenger.,0
well never knew you could connect the kinect into minecraft...microsoft must have made some big changes under the hood for armor stands..,0
"the extra information, a few numbers to be exact, could confuse new players and make the game feel too complex.",0
yeah only mammals have nipples.,0
"man, he won iem vs world elite, he totally deserves a spot !",0
"new ui so tilting, makes me play bad",0

"i watched my dad play ut when i was a kid, and i can confirm that im now a psychopath who massmurders people",0

"because obviously the pros have godlike sensitivity-decisions, all other senses except those being used are useless.",0
"yeah, its probably his intelligence and not a language barrier issue or anything.",0
almost if there is a lot of different people in here,0
i like to see those beautiful linus eyes at 4k.,1
and i was so looking forward to playing this on my dreamcast.,0
you need to pay valve more money for the high res skins,0
"disney's cory in the house, duh",0
"yeah, we found the boston bomber we can find this kid too!",0
feels so great to require an item to be barely functional instead of having a passive that acts as a boon.,0
"dude, survival game games maps are way bigger",0
i for one am so glad we got an event with summoner icons and a disabled gangplank instead of replays and sandbox mode,0

"why yes lets just wait until its done and its too late to be changed, what a great idea op!",0
"oh no i didnt get an icon oh no what a tragedy, i cant use it over my other 50 icons including baron santa, fizz icon, debonair icon, mecha icon, etc",0
"or, just buy a lot of keys because there's bound to be a really expensive knife in there somewhere.",0
"they don't really take ideas from reddit though, remember, they know better.",0
"yeah, mario kart 8/bayonetta 2/w101 were such *huge* disappointments.",0
"well duh, it's the save picture!",0
"yeah, because everybody was able to get it when it was a gamestop exclusive wii game",0
good thing that riot has made crit less rng,0
"csgo on controller, hardcore gamer confirmed",0
he's the kind of awper who plays better with rifles,0
"yeah man, did you not use it pre-patch?",0
"faze and optic are rich af, they'll probably buy fnatic, c9 and tsm.",0
"i'm sorry, i didn't mean for my dog to leave paw marks on your skin",0
i found out about talents when i was in my mid 30s get on my level scrub,0
but smurfing doesn't ruin peoples games at all,0
so glad i didn't buy wander full price!,0
guess that wasn't obvious enough without the,0
because you don't have a cellphone with you.,0
yeah that birch one has always looked out of place to me.,0
"don't forget to buy stickers though, 75% off!",0
a musician didn't invent guitar strings so they can't complain when people pirate their music.,0
the only way to lower his win rate is letting new people play him.,0
well a name change to 'riot china' would be a good first step...,0
"there is no such thing as being racist against whites, don't you know that shitlord?",0
inb4 teams gamble their winnings,0
because moving a server is easy,0
"quality patch content, i'm glad someone took the time to do this.",0
and worlds will be less hype and less loud?,0
they wont since its a support item so it has to be expensive so other people wont abuse it,0
"im not trying to be toxic, but you seem kinda salty",0
i would gladly take some of his money to help him with his problems.,0
well if you can re-create the problem consistently maybe a dev will see this and will say that they'll work on it.,0
"pfft, clg went 6-0 in playoffs while fnatic went 6-2 so that means clg is obviously the better team",0
"even if the recommended page was nothing but 10x10 rows of upgraded trinkets, people still wouldn't upgrade, because saving for half an amp tome when you're down 10 kill is way more valuable than vision.",0
yea because giving a new ip a chance is ludicrous.,0
i think you meant vac-ation :') you didnt phrase it right.,0
they're sooo overpaid that they're willing to risk losing their jobs to get a little more money on the side...cough xwx,0
"great idea, let's make skarner even better!",0
"way too overedited, next time play some classical music",0
better not pick a jungle then and run double support ...,0
"no way man, not when there are super easy no skill jokes about bronze to be made",0
yeah they are never right about anything,0
"whatchu talking about, i absolutely love when reddit tries to tell clg what to do like they know everything that's wrong with the team.",0
oh there's your problem you're using a mac!,0
unless tips are coded as minions -- like everything else is?,0
b-but successful businesses can never be morally corrupt!,0
i'm pretty sure thinking about whether to pause the game or not is their main concern when they are in the middle of a teamfight with skt t1.,0
zqk quit keyd because of the incosistency lately.,0
because everyone knows when you are being sarcastic through typed words... there is a reason people us,0
"but dmg is the land of the scrublords and there aren't any cheaters, we just suck major dickage",0
right..because at this stage in the game they still deserve the benefit of the doubt,0
too many feels man :((( i cri erytiem,0
because playing against a nunu is so much more fun to play against.,0
wow he died at the end what a noob,0
i honestly think jks is the aus get_right xd nip-jks- inc xddd,1
lol i piss on those few thousand dollars sounds about right,0
"most players in na are not in the lcs, this % would be really low i imagine.",0
omfg you guys are smurfing you should kill your self,0
because reddit says pre-ordering is literally the worst thing ever and is killing the game industry?,0
"yea, cus smoke takes lower skill ceiling.",0
shut up nobody cares about your logic we're here to circle jerk we don't give a shit about how past games ran at max day 1...,0
his attack range increase makes creep block less impactful,0
maybe if we upvote this enough we will get some free shit!,0
but he misses so many q's at the start of the video,0
"guise, don't call them hackers or cheaters, just call them skiddies.",0
people have so much faith in riot balance and decision making they expect them to just know which format is better.,0
that guinsoo nerf lol now it is finally balanced,0
"what you talking about m8, we'd always wanted a western cowboy shooter.",0
"yah this is what the world needs, another generic survival game.",0
if only anivia didn't have a passive,0
just another reason why cs:cz is the best counterstrike,1
its probably because you are toxic to play with,0
shame it was mm maybe were getting 128 tick soon,0
this game is available on ps4 therefore this belongs on the ps4 sub,0
"great game, tons of varied content",1
bahahahahahaaha he totally hit his head,0
"oh wow, he really went downhill after clg",0
acorn and imp make lgd team that is not poor,0
yea cause waiting for an avatar prop was worth it.,0
who is ibp and why are they banned?,0
because there was so much other new content to do for solo playing.,0
"gitgud, there's absolutely no rng in the game since they reverted rifle changes.",0
oh i didn't know you were sarcastic.,0
i guess because they are banned their opinions are no longer valid.,0
deranking back to dmg from global.,0
"grandpa, did you stop taking your pills?",0
obviously you just aren't using that pink ward that you always have in your inventory quick enough.,0
24 people would just create a much more toxic environment,0
"i would tell them to get rid of this karma farming posts, go to askreddit if you want this going on",0
"no way, they absolutely need more artists to make skins for additional cases.",0
hearthstone has very little rng,0
the double awp b set up works everytime,1
yes because ibp did something on the level of murder,0
ranks above le aren't achievable for na anymore after update.,0
if only there was a search bar function where you could look and find posts that have been posted previously!,0
[the 5 guys that got ported away are essentially token player characters.],0
what if i'm using my go long a macro?,0
fucking kids can't imagine why people think you're toxic.,0
he makes good calls because he can see the enemies through walls.,0
"he deserves global, but he only has a 60hz monitor",0
yeah im fucking awful with every single one of these champions thats why im asking for them to be more rewarding when played well,0
"stewie is only good under the one and only, our lord and savior, the big o.",0
so that confirms that it's coming next week right?,0
yea apotheon is really state of the art that's why it has such a huge save file,0
"alternate timeline just like in wod, it's logical and totally makes sense.",0
"afaik there's a rule on esl which says: terrorist must not use ak47, counter-terrorist must not use m4a4 or m4a1-s",0
i think its safe to assume clg doesn't have any strats,0
"i thought we were talking about league of legends here, on reddit of all places",0
but it all goes back to riot in the form of fines,0
pretty sure this guy is the first one to open up a varicamo m4 and this wooo let me use that gun immediately!,0
i'm sure the police would bother with finding 40 people for a thief.,0
but adcs are weak and can't carry and need buffs.,0
2 to 300 fps is terrible though.,0
so remove the animation of singed w its not a buff he just feels smother right?,0
because it promotes toxicity and grinding.,0
can't wait for those sweet caitlyn and leona nerfs.,0
because we need this sub filled with any tips to get better post averaging 74 per hour,0
wow this looks great can't wait for this to happen,1
that's why we need tiered shields mojang pls add!,0
thats why store mounts are such a hit.,0
"i don't know about you, but i was worrying what kind of controller he was gonna get *all - fucking - week* so this is a **huge** load off my mind.",0
im a nip fangay and can confirm f0rest is 2nd best player ever,0
goldshire is the absolute best rp area.,1
good to see the whole 40 seconds,0
"but, but, but i don't want digital",0
"cause he's not toxic in a chat that has a mute function and you can easily use to ignore said toxicity, no, he's just intentionally destroying games, that is much less of an issue then calling someone an idiot, right ?",0
clearly if your best is 0/8 your best is trash and you should probably stop playing league as the system kindly suggests,0
yes one can only imagine how difficult it must be to write a script that lets people leave the game after a person hasn't connected,0
man i sure love this subreddit!,0
"yeah... cz wasn't op, it is the other guns/pistols were weak tec9 wasn't op, they just overnerf cz augweek wasn't op, all guns should have the same accuracy m4a1 wasn't op, we need to up a4...",0
i cant wait to listen to sjokz prediction!,1
tell that to people who average 40 fps,0
once a cheater always a cheater,0
would you not want a **giant** hole in your earlobe,0
"oh yeah you are right, because every single game ever designed has auto god mode built in...",0
"and twitch went like, vac vacation.",0
no man is better to ask for things,0

you're doing this whole mod thing wrong... aren't you supposed to be power hungry and show the world how much power you have on a daily basis?,0
so does this mean flusha wont be playing the remaining fnatic games?,0
it takes a lot of effort to copy and paste the same comment to every single thread about worlds.,0
hey huni picked it as a counter pick vs darius and that worked really well...,0
of course he would say this to defend his underwhelming fragging as of late!,0

we definitely need two different worms titles on the xbox,0
"the technology is simply not there yet, do you imagine how much work it is they have to trenslate it in 25 different language and shit and have a special crew to respond to question conserning it",0
those eggs are awesome because they're original and gen 1 and og as fuck.,0
"no mens, flusha is best entry fragger eu",0
because being christian and believing science are obviously mutually exclusive,0
this is definitely the kind of constructive feedback that will fix pvp.,0

that's what you get for using skype,0
yeah let's make fun of silvers for being bad at the game!,0
of course the main carry is an unranked smurf.,0

"sorry that i dont live in the past, things have changed, imports have been made, in every region, if we talk about history then history has been made domestically where for the first time every a team went undefeated, but no i will be called stupid if i hype them up cause eu is shit and the east rocks",0
fnc took skt to 5 games but og took fnc to 5 games and edg took skt to 5 games its an og edg final you heard it here first,0
playing the game is a burden therefore earning ip is oppressive.,0
"you can't blame them, you're stopping them from going pro!",0
"didnt you read the patch notes, dead man's plate got added to the game",0
then they are going to delete the extra mission they spent who knows how many hours working on.,0
"yeah sorry, i'm pretty dumb obviously haha.",0
as is a map that is specifically marked as for advanced users only,0
"absolutely, like why would they take barrier, it's not like it's a direct counter to ignite or something.",0
clearly the game we've all been waiting for...,0
"yeah, a multiplayer game that consistently connects people on opposite ends of the globe together on a p2p connection is amazing.",0
"i don't know what game that is but boy do bullet go fast in this game, it's just like sanic",0
i think this icon should be free and part of the champion mastery system.,0
"clearly not to make fun of people like you, but to confirm i'm scripting",0
"yes, 90/7/3 was actually the day i was born ^",0
yup that tsm playstyle definitely leads to dyrus making poor decisions that make him free kills for enemy junglers,0
eu should import more kr players maybe they can get out of groups,0
yeah sure.. febiven was basically nonexistent this series,0
yeah we arn't gonna just drop our 1 hour cooldown guild bank spell...,0
"league of legend has a dark, secret past",0
yeah cause stating that another company gives free stuff to a free game means he has downs,0
"yes, you are the only fucking one on this planet, the one and only special snowflake that is hyped.",0
indeed ekko's ult is point and click with no counterplay possible,0
i bet he's just using that knowledge to write hax,0
that is 3 whole days already riot why are you making us wait so long,0
i guess the twitch chat was like: nice double hs flusha; great shot; very nice,0
those were some well thought out and fair reasons,0
i thought that was just called fallout 3?,0
"yeah, fuck gamers for demanding games be shipped finished and not 50% locked away in on disc dlc.",0
"he is right, you don't need to use e, just use flash instead",0
maybe valve will start encouraging more staff to work on csgo,0
it takes valuable time and money to put these bundles together.,0
yeah who wants a working game with hundreds of cars and a great choice of tracks when you can (hope to) play project cars,0
"no, i responded to a very specific comment that i didn't take the time to read.",0
you're right... seagull is such a casual,0
yeah testing how well it works with streaming,1
"na doesnt understand ties so rito cannot put bo2 in na lcs, its pure logic",0
"froggen to grav, thats gonna be fun",1
they have to play at least one major with it just to see how it goes.,0
pro sports is just watching criminals in between crimes,0
"global is too easy for me, i should go pro actually",0
he actually said you make me erect ;),0
i mean the lpl picks weird shit like irelia support and nautilus mid so honestly maybe the fans thought it was a real comp,0
you should have showed up on time.. but keep blaming everyone else for your problems because that is definitely how you get ahead!,0
"i would play all the metal gears on pc, but one time when i played metal gear solid 2 there was supposed to be a shadow of vulcan raven that was supposed to appear but it didn't, so i am just gonna buy the whole collection on ps3.",0
but solo queue is not important,0
yeah and almost like announcing literally years ago that it wasn't anything similar to fable just set in the universe but hey fuck them for letting everyone know beforehand that they wanted to try a new style of game why aren't game devs slaves to what i want,0
"yeah, i heard esea was the better way to get into fpl",0
ocean should check this out - free learning lesson,0
sony really shouldn't have built their deck without trap cards.,0
yes lets stage a mass boycott of over half a million players that'll go well,0
na fpl and chill does not fit in a sentence,0
"just remember, they're not american so by default their better and more deserving",0
"yeah, you're right, the tauren, trolls, horde pandaren and blood elves are super evil.",0
ha i found this post very amusing!,1
"yes ldlc is an online shopping in france, you can buy mouse with aim hack integrated",0
no they are not you obviously have no idea what you are saying ;),0
"oh right, orphans have never played videogames.",0
"yeah i know right, it's not like they changed players since they lost to sbenu",0
swag needs to kill this stewie2k persona right now before this gets way out of hand.,0
"silver 2 mate, reddit ranks don't lie",0
"because forcing them into having an even larger gap on their resumes is justified, nobody deserves a chance in life for taking my 50 cents in skins!",0
"what we need are cod like kill cames for the last kill of every round, just like in cod",0
"yes, because $0.99 games really need to be resold.",0
yea titan should be top 3 ez scream,0
yeah there's more games sold because of smurfs,0
lets change everything to how it was in 1.6 because it was such a better game,0
the technology just isnt there yet,0
"low level dungeons are srs man, can't have dps pulling things!",0
its not fair that you get to talk to the enemy team during warm up and i don't (because i chose the option not to),0
obviously as easy as just having it in the client,0
no you were supposed to read them in morgan freeman voice,0
"starting off 2016 with a bang, eh sony?",0
that's an odd way to spell bullshit liar,0
if that's what you like to use for lube...,0
please tell me there's an implied,0
"well you have an amd, what do you expect",0
ok then i guess i'll just stay semi merged into your face and half a sheep,0
ye vac bans just come out of nothing,0
giving him an even stronger lane phase than his already oppressive one was really needed i'm sure.,0
theres always a chance for that good drop,1
you have to remember riot games is a small game developer,0
it's not fun when u mistakenly invite a global to a nova queue,0
"i dunno man, he has a *ton* of subscribers",0
"bro that team that got aced against zion spartan sure didn't know the concept of kiting, despite being masters / challengers",0
exactly being an unkillable tank assassin that can build full tank with 1 damage item to blow you up is just part of his identity.,0
"well the 'best team in the west' crashing at msi ans afterwards is a flop while a dominating team winning the split not undefeated is ... yes, definitly the expectations and reality duftet more for fnc than for tsm",0
glad we got this meme for us adults then,0
still salty... how much did you lost,0
it's the client telling you to go into a custom game to practice against bots.,0
but they are 'trustedreviews' - surely a website named like this must be trustworthy?,0
build full movement speed so you can outrun him,0
just imagine if he had the sated buff,0
shows how strong adc's are in today's meta,0
this was all done on purpose so the teams would not be able to get to dreamhack,0
because concepts can be similar and yin and yang is a new concept that hasn't been done in anything else.,0
because someone playing a gamemode they like is so awful and should be punished!,0
"yeah, they really should revamp a site because teams really don't execute on it.",0
"yea, internetnl would have been better",0
helps a lot in those 10 kills per map.,0
yeah dude fuck riot for banning a toxic player that had a lot of chat restrictions aka chances to get reformed.,0
good thing i haven't been checking my messages every 15 minutes since the announcement...,0
that's the perfect chance for a reddit team in lcs,0
"but i thought part of being a pro was adapting, and if you can't adapt you die",0
yeah gambit is the poster child of that being a good decision,0
"not really, i mean solo queue doesn't matter and everyone is just so toxic.",0
"remember, it said slower rate of fire so it obviously is worse then the a4",0
all you need is 115 stacks and you can one shot it,0
can't shoot fingers valve you dun messed up.,0
obviously hitboxes fixes hit reg issues.,0
"yes, please, ap tank jungles need more terrifying options than they currently do with rylais, ibg, liandry's, roa, abyssal, they definitely need an ap/armor/mr/tenacity item to let them get their sorc shoes.",0
man you have such a solid argument.,0
"yeee, cause if he was he would be op",0
obvious scripting why so many people praise him?,0
he probably wouldn't say learn the *fucking* difference if he talked to the president of the united states of grammar nazis,0
"of course not, why would we be able to report someone after carefully watching the demo from their perspective?",0
yeah they definitely don't do that anymore.,0
"yes, dlift must be shit, since he has 101 less games than rekkles and is in master duoing with his support and not his mid.",0
wtf are you on about they were all american and got into lcs and were great under the name cloud 9,0
can we all just agree that gta io has the most realistic vehicle deformation?,0
does this mean febiven is better than faker,0
i'm sure this petition will have a huge impact on valve's decision regarding the next operation.,0
and again freakazoid having no impact at all.,0
it should knock players to the ground and stun them for a short period of time,0
f0rest going to fnatic confirmed!,1
yea and all those idiots who would rather watch pro sports then play them.,0
800*600 makes for really clear videos and gifs,0
4 shots from an adc don't do any damage since adc's are useless,0
no i must belittle other people's accomplishments,0
too many repeating champs should force use of tahmkench and teemo for variety's sake,0
"viewmodel setting please, that looks really good settings.",0
oh no competition this worlds sucks,0
making people buy stuff instead of unlocking it is always good for the consumer!,0
i thought it was a solidarity thing from one terrorist to another,0
"yeah man, mushroom biomes are really rare.",0
juggernaut-tier diana sounds so fun to play against.,0
"gee, thanks for letting people know so they start asking again...",0
"gee, your other controller seems to be missing its case.",0
"thnx volvo, literally unplayable.",0
"stupid player named kqly, obvious hacker",0
"fuck you, why am i being banned you riot cunt!",0
i feel like chewyy is missing here,0
good thing that geforce experience is fully bugged and i can't install new driver or even use the software.,0
"gee, i'm absolutely shocked an ea/dice game has that kind of oversight in it",0
you mean at the start of the round you dont shoot them like everyone else...,0
dont tell me what to do with my money!,0
the fact that they only won because of two bugs is perfect evidence of that.,0
"i don't care about improving, i want a new teemo skin already",0
man i wonder if chief makes it out alive,0
yeah really spend all your time in a chair at work or watching tv on a chair at home like everyone else!,0
clearly op just got the french flag upside down,0
"yea, you are right every single current gen game released so far is a perfect ten.",0
but seriously when does the new ui come out and how come i have a game i didn't buy,0
i know right...saying febiven is top 2 mid is pretty hilarious,0
"oh yeah, that team would stomp everyone!",0
"now guys, from now on, all posts with 'scream' and 'all hs' will be removed for repetitiveness.",0
you are going out from everywhere then?,0
yeah couse it so easy to ace on a eco vs full buy,0
"yes, i was being entirely serious.",0
"come on, acs is clearly one of the best games in the genre, i mean it's set in london, what more do you want?",0
yah im sure they would announce that on the playstation blog makes perfect sense.,0
"nah to prove that you actually need to show that you're not touching the mouse or else it's not 100% sure, but at least we can get a really nice phone video where we can't actually see the bug at all because he's shaking his phone, but that's way better than not being 100% sure that he's not lying about his mouse",0
because it is ea and that is equal to being bad!,0
"why use the search, just add one of the 50 people you know from the top of the friends list.",0
probably because the only plays of his that you see are in montages,0
shit talking while na's asleep i see.,0
"you're underestimating koo, they have vastly improved since their ge days, especially with their new jungler who replaced that weak player called lee.",1
especially her light rework and ultimate skin this year,1
"yeah your attitude is much better, i will take tips from you instead",0
5.0 attack speed = 5 attacks per second this isnt going to be broken at all,0
twitch viewers really are a reliable source of valuable and accurate feedback,0
"no man, call of duty has the best servers, it is the best selling first person shooter every year and it has also the best servers.",0
i can tell you know a lot about the current stage of vr,0
you just couldn't see him cause you probably have an ezio monitor.,0
well i guess riot doesn't like making money?,0
"wow, perfectly logical wall bang, lets post it on reddit and try to get some karma...",0
resubmitting your post that got deleted 30 minutes ago - good one,0
*improved graphics mod only 29.99*,0
so how much of these do you need to add to a server?,0
"but it's on wikipedia, it must be accurate",0
this is more real than real life,1
now i know why janna ad jungle didn't work,0
"however if you try too hard, you're a try-hard so you gotta find good medium between being a shitter, and trying too hard to win.",0
because that was the only thing borderlands had going for it.,0
"a very original idea, good job comming up with that all on your own",0
but why play a game for the great mechanics when you could have a great story?,0
but dl is good just cant carry his teammates,0
"as the games this weekend proved, obviously.",0
"yeah, obviously c9 was the only team that made mistakes.",0
"yeah i mean the jews must have done something wrong, right?",0
i think you're the first one to care.,0
"maybe he has a workout game, 5 push-ups per kill 99%",0
"apparantly, while i'm at it i hate pizza and sony...don't even get me started on no man's land",0
"good guy rito made bundle 2000rp instead of 250*10=2500rp, i knew that they aren't greedy.",0
i bet those elise buffs will make her god tier,0
club penguin is where the real shit is at...fucking scrubz.,0
"smoking is edgy as fuck dude, no question about it.",0
how i am going to tp to lane now,0
nah kalista that uses her ult to help her support get to lane faster shows that she has counter play duh,0
at least hai is the best na rengar.,0
it takes a lot of skill for valor to mark the correct target.,0
"yeah, riot is clearly lacking money.",0
then they got banned for sharing personal details?,0
"i love triple-ported old flash games, totally worth money.",0
"you have to hold 'w' when bhopping, it makes you go faster because it's the forward key.",0
"women are allowed to fuck mothers too, don't be so insensitive you sexist pig",0
the only way anyone can be good at this game is to be hopped up on speed.,0
yeah i think the basic trinket should cost 35g too because any idiot can just slap down a ward too,0
so we get a closer look at a cigarette?,0
"of course, they won agaisnt vp because their coach had autoaim",0
uhm anyone that has muscle is a douchebag bro,0
you could save lots of money and get better performance by building your own tablet.,0
i'm sure that wouldn't motivate anyone to cheat...,0
"right, because everyone used sixaxis on the ps3",0
ooh gotta kill em with dat tp boiiiz,1
you should go to the fallout sub and tell them that fallout 4 is actually the 5th game in the franchise and that new vegas is the 4th.,0
if we are getting rid of inferno why not dust 2 as well.,0
i use mwheeldown/up and mouse1/2 to crouch,1
"sure let's let them have baron, we'll get the timer afterwards anyway.",0
i thought he was the dictator from just cause 2?,0
yes because no one is talking during their kills they all know what to do and don't need anyone to organize them,0
just because taiwan always performs in international tournaments for a few years doesn't mean they are good.,0
monte is *known* to have very nuanced opinion.,0
this post was totally about math,0

"everyone dont buy it, so it will be ours forever!",0
"but guys, my console is just as powerful as most computers!",0

i know how could somebody not know something?,0
he finnaly got boosted to where he deserved only to realize his teammates are now holding him back even more.,0

you get more with regular... buy that one,0
"exactly, that's why you can put pegs on top of the pegs.",0
i'm sure pro players are pro players because they spend all of their time playing vs people several tiers of skill below them,0
look at the amazing ground texture in the second one.,0
yes cause oklahoma is landlocked,0
"nah it totally means they're slacking off, dev effort is proportional to features released.",0
yaaay more 2d side scrollers,0
"yeah, fizz was never a viable option for competitive play.",0
"i mean, i don't know where you got that idea, he hasn't ever done anything like that in the past.",0
just like we saw how good honor system worked,0
who cares about drophackers and scripters as long as people who say gg ez are getting banned for toxicism,0
3v3 challenger is worth so much :\^),0
they could've said it at least four times.,0

i am sworn to carry your burdens,0
fucking flair smurfs ruining the integrity of this sub,0
nope tes doesn't have numbers just letters and a subtitle.,0
because she definitely beats the likes of zed and fizz,0
yes cause you code this kind of things as a self inflicted damage instead of input damage modifiers,0
so the only conclusion is that being perma-locked is obviously more fun than being hit by a point&amp;click ability,0
yeah i bet the multiplayer on this game is way dead now,0
because netherrack in a bedrock layer is totally not obvious in any way,0
clearly hacks even csgo points it out,0
"your aim just sucks, you shot through his balaclava, aim for his chest instead where is head is located.",0
"he is getting a new skin next patch, thats some serious attention",0
it's animus that's bugging not the actual game,0
"it's clearly fake, madagascar would've closed everything ages ago.",0

"...that was totally intentional, i swear!",0
"yeah, i always hoped fallout would be a bit more like the sims...",0
yea cause we all know how fast updates happen in dota,0
your knowledge is so huge what you are saying makes so much sense,0
yes because the people that develop the new client and replay system are the same people that make skins.,0
and being cancelled all of less than a week from release should make everyone super excited and pumped about buying the halo 5 statue,0
"no, it's a kingdom hearts reference",0
thats why it was such a huge game esports wise,1
why dont they just release replays instead and you could still see all that info,0
you can.. for $20 a month and at a maximum 720p output with shotty lag and audio quality.,0
"no, i'm sure everyone was a saint at 17.",0
nah he's just phoon on his smurf,0
"he probably just found a cure for it, that no doctor has been able to find yet.",0
"yay i'm glad we got another support, the true heroes of league of legends!",0

hope you have 14 days worth of things you can do.,0
"nazis are baddies and scums of the earth, they deserve it.",0
but he's global that means he's always right.,0
it's because of all the hackers,0
"good thinking, better give it back to alister too.",0
i mean good thing you were aiming for their knees when turning that corner,0
"yeah because in comp everybody just rushes through smoke, bhopping with their knife out.",0
not viable because you need a jump throw script,0
"because a metroid game on the wiiu is for sure, absolutely not coming in the future confirmed",0
"riot being assholes , news to me",0
good to see riot is using their resources well,0
but its all about the deeps brah!,0
and sona players are too busy rolling their face on their keyboard to aim it anyway,0
"can we shut up with that dude like seriously, your 11th birthday party is a big deal",0
or how about get a replay system amirite guys?,0
"yes, because as we all know *only* males can be attracted to women.",0
"it's more cinematic, of course!",0
but... but... rito promised me voice chat... and they haven't given it to me yet... injustice,0
"zed such a toxic assassin, better change his kit even though it's one of the best designed kits in the game",0
because they're quirky and original thinkers!,0
"i'm s2 but i'd be ge 100% if no hackers, russians, smurfs and bad teammates.",0
"right, he just hated cloud9 in their first split",0
approximately the length of one season of game of thrones.,0
"instalock, say nothing, than go to the lane you want",0
he's truly embracing how clg use their top laners,0
circlejerks are only bad if you disagree with the premise.,0
"yeah, isn't it generally accepted that everyone playing in the premier league is british?",0
yeah because shouting buying rune scimitar on end is sooo fun.,0
wow cool stuff from when we were kids.,0
there are too many 3d games coming out lately.,0
"yeah lol, lot's of gamers don't realize it's wireless till they drop their controllers.",0
"dude, that's a 3v1, stop lying for the karma!",0
sounds like someone's looking for a slap,0
if she couldn't it would be bad game mechanics.,0
"but maybe if he was warned, he would've stepped up his game!",0
because im 11 and know more than you,0
itt: a bunch of alliance ninnies who want the law to be upheld.,0
"c'mon, this is the internet, where its zero suit samus cosplays or nothing.",0
"but he needs kills to get money it's clearly your fault he only has a bf sword 18 mins in you totally stole that one kill from him, and because of that he can't snowball.",0
your edgy memes are on point today,0
because the whole point of triforce is for the proc not for the 3.5k worth of stats it gives,0
but you can't connect a pc to tv!,0
"play katarina, you can win games using your forehead.",0
"huh, who would've thought that wouldn't be any fun?",0
i deserve to be supreme it's just my shit teammates keep making me lose,0

yeah poor zlatan i really hope he wins a title before he retires,0
"oh no you see it's still in beta, so once the pros get involved there will be much more complex strategies, and blizzard has tons of money to invest into esports so it will have a huge competitive scene",0
i am gonna go use over 9000 proxies to get hyperdeminsion neptunia in sm4sh,0
that toss stick combo is a toughy.,0
"don't be silly, its not like individual mod bias or opinion could influence a decision based around intent, something completely circumstantial and entirely based on interpretation with no evidence to support it.",0
come on dude... he carried the mod team,0
because the next price up for a stack is always almost double.,0
"you're right, we should nerf every weapon that can do crazy clutches.",0
so that's how you stop getting ganked top lane.,0
yeah cos mods are actually the spawn of satan,0
"yea, i think he needs kalista passive.",0
doesn't count because it was done in 128 tick,0
"yeah, sneaky is such a terrible lucian player.",0
"did you adjust for inflation, old timer?",0
"yeah, but he can't have as much fun doing those as he is picking on people who have a harder time fighting back.",0
because twitch chat is full of challenger players offering *extremely high quality* analysis of the game,0
prob because the best csgo teams are from sweden so by default they are better than you,0
you don't understand - he did it *ironically*,0
delays are for downgrading purposes only,0
"the good times when keys were 2.66 ref... the good times... oh, and when valve actually watered the potted plant but whatever",0

"wow sneaky just had to give it away like typical adcs, just like doublelift.",0
"who cares about slippery slope arguments, someone else can deal with that!",0
microsoft doesn't do anything out of the good of their hearts...,0

"nah man, i deserve everything for free",0
"yeah, that's the point of the photo.",0
"welcome the league of cinderhulk where 5k hp is the bare minimum, unless you're an adc; cause fuck you.",0
thinking that the name of the guns on the main menu don't matter is why you're a double ak.,0
because the build for sup kha is super set in stone as a meta pick right?,0
"seriously there are no bad reviews of broken age, provide links",0
"uh, you normally should call gg after losing the pistol round.",0
"he still has the same uptime on his shield, so he will still block the same one aa he did before this change, except now he will have his shield up less in lane, so it will be easier to harass him, but its k because he has an extra 40 hp shield for 1 sec late game",0
this will keep me away from reaching challenger...,0
they are working on steam customer support,0
because we all know apm requirement = skill requirement,0

"ye, they clearly removed it from youtube...",0
"quality post, hope this makes it to the front page.",1
no you should play everything in order all the time,0

that's nice and all but where is the original japanese cover?,0
"omg he was nr1 challenger in singapore , definately the best soloq player",0
yeah all kinds of dlc content is literally satan and never reasonable!,0
still hardly more expensive than a gcc adaptor...,0
you aren't allowed to have fun until you tryhard your way to challenger like the rest of us.,0
"quick let's start a rumor about how the beta is gonna start on the 28th, everyone loves those!",0
"we also know the langues, jewish and islamic.",0
its so he can fix matches easier.,0
don't worry its in beta it'll get fixed in 2016,0
so this is what riot's been doing instead of making a new champion,0
he is just lifting his mouse dude you are probably silver lol,0
sounds like a reputable source.,0
"when you think about it, it's a wonder how steel and moe get along.",0
"yeah, so sad for steel, he is the victim here.",0
maybe that's why the odds were so close,0
"so lets set the precedent that if you're involved in match fixing in professional csgo if you're under 18 when you do it i guess it's alright and you can get unbanned because you don't know any better, makes sense to me.",0
doing sarcasm over text is easy as fuck.,0
"nah, they can just afford a on of adspace with the lack of money they are making",0
goddamn you guys being all reasonable making us look like idiots with pitchforks ---e,0
"dying light, dayz, h1z1, dead island 2, the walking dead, dead rising 3, the evil within, the last of us remastered... i don't know what you mean.",0
but reddit taught me to always ask for a refund,0
today i learned canadian dollars arent the same as american or australian dollars.,0
oh yea the tanky dps mage assassin bruiser support jungler burst carry needs buffs,0
it's fine he clearly just minified his code,0
doesn't help that a bunch of misogynist pigs stopped playing her because she covered her midriff.,0
well that just goes to show you how well optimized the game is,0
"this means all those game producers are from the left wing, fuckin communists.",0
yeah waiting 50mn to 3h20 is totally not a punishment,0
"yeah, cause there are so many to chose from.",0
"yeah, don't they know we have a sub full of professionals here?",0
maybe it's the world's first quantum gpu?,0
"move the fuck over, sliced bread.",0
thats because every global is just a hacking or second account anyways,0
making your radar scale smaller is cheating too because it lessens the required skill and map knowledge,0
"yeah, luckily we're paying now for psn so they have been able to deliver better performance on their network",0
"yeah, who cares about the people that actually enjoyed those games.",0
"its illidan in disguise, he has come to get the skull of guldan because black temple was...merely a setback.",0
hhhmmm i wonder why it's not like canada borders america or anything,0
tsm thoorin as head analyst please,0
hahaha oh my god you're so funny and original.,0
but my 1v5 glock clutch is special!,0

because of the same reason kata is op.,0
"as someone who picked up vi recently i feel i am always left alone, noob team!",0
obviously all are suckers when a ret destroys them since as you learned they do no dps,0
"yes, gotta celebrate being able to finally be able to say you're straight with out being killed.",0
every game they lost was a throw because you lost skins,0
yeah let's just make all invisibility spells also grant invulnerability for balance because being invisible isn't good enough!,0
"no, we are paying 60 bucks for nothing.",0
that would make a huge difference,0
because all women have to be busty and naked or look 5 years old.,0
omg but it is so similar to arcade sona fuck that skin rito,0
you have to worry because total biscuit said so because qc issues because it's lying to the consumer because it's a bad game - not running on 999 fps on 9k resolution because it's bad and consumers nowadays are all mindless whales who will just spot buy everything,0
"it's point and click like taric, no?",0
"hey dude reddit knows all, you shouldn't question it.",0

screw valve for making something you weren't meant to get to anyway unclippable.,0
come on that's just the 16-tick demo,0
"also your crosshair, chair, mouse and keyboard?",0
but you'll never use that .5 gb,0
still waiting for piglet to mouse only doublelift...,0
this video is fake and cgi khazix is non-meta jungler and ergo cannot win games and is unviable.,0
ye because being the number 2 is not at all worth it!,0
gee i wonder why they didnt go on pbe,0
i work for ms too and if you give me your username and password i can get you a free years worth of xbox live.,0
they should just remove the particles and different model and make it 750.,0
butbutbut we just got a female champion... i call for gender equality you feminazi's,0
"no but if you included information about where i lived and worked i might, but of course we all know that hasn't ever happened",0

which is very easy with sub200 dmg abilities,0
"th is r/gaming, downvoted don't follow the rules of the rest of reddit",0
doublelift literally worst ad carry na,0

maybe shes not a ban in high elos but in lower shes pretty much banned every game and if you dont ban her and the enemies get her you get why didnt you ban trist dumbass ahh i love being in silver,0
in other words this was a super simple play that i do in bronze all the time but my team keeps me back,0
well i'd rather not see them unless they're js.,0

"i'm glad they zoomed in, i never would have noticed the shadows otherwise",0
"um hey man, your vid isn't in 4k, so i don't know why you got 4k in the title",0
"if it was polygon then that makes sense, because all games are silly, of course.",0
"yeah, this is something totally new to league of legends.",0
"they should only match players with the same amount of games and mmr, 100 games vs 100 games, 101 vs 101, same mmr, champ pool, cs, average game time etc",0
"yeah, that's absolutely why my smurf got vacced and not my main.",0
"obviously the marginal upgrade from what's already a top tier cpu is worth 150fps, duh, pay attention",0
"with ekko getting movementspeed + slowing the enemy + dealing damage to them, can vayne's silver bolts get a similar system?",0

i guess fury is a 200 series gpu then,0
he just has a very good headset.,0
"seriously, your english too good for a russian, please stop giving me good images of russians so i can whine about them more ingame!",0
it takes them 6 years to make a game so you just need to wait a few more years (still buy every bad port till then) and the problem will be fixed,0
"this game is so bad, developers has to pay the users to play the game wow.",0
might as well stop supports from taking ignite too while you're at it.,0

you don't think coast can beat tsm or tip?,0
so you're saying having rng in a strategy-based game is bad?,0
because udyr was really popular when he got an ultimate skin.,0
any analyst would laugh and tell you peec gaming is dying don't be an moron.,0
if you don't like a post you downvote it so no one else can see it right?,0
don't be silly shes working as intended,0
"sony can't be evil, i give them my money!",0

"i love the item squish in wod, in mop you ran around with like 400k hp and now finally after the squish you are nearly running around with 399k hp, yay",0
let's make all series bo11 then to be absolutely sure the better team goes through.,0
"its fine, if you get a 30$ drop, doesn't even matter.",0
no wonder they left him hanging after a match!,0
the exception that proves the rule,0
champs without abusable gap closers so like six?,0
"well why wouldn't you, it gives you armor against the opposing adc and it gives you damage to counter him.",1
buying weed is a scam because it's illegal to sell weed.,0
oh nooo that .05 ap ratio off of her ultimate spells will totally dumpster her.,0

"no, i think only ahri should have quote if she kill baron or dragon",0
i swear that i'd be lem if we had 128 servers.,0
"wow, na'vi is throwing, they all tried to knife him.",0
scalpers can't touch the stock because everything is sold out.,0
"nono, this is fake guys, there isn't scripting in league.",0
0 smokes used in the entire competition,0
but she's so skill-intensive champion you need to know how to play her to make her effective,0
yeah just walk that broken leg off,0
"duh, because it's saturday and on saturdays rito is literally hitler.",0
you have to highlight the white text to find the part about sacrificing children in the name of riot.,0
it's actually an alien from outer space which happens to closely resemble the look of female humans,0
the skill curve for becoming a pro interviewer is just way higher,0
"yes, corridor shooters and linear rpgs are the only alternative",0
it's people like you that rub it in after...,0
it would be cool if she had bonus stats while shes in river,1
i play ahri jungle and she is clearly the most nerfed,0
pretty sure riven is still viable,1
scream ride not enough for you?,0
fuck you bro consoles are so fucking cheep!,0
"yeah, valve has a great track record caring about fans.",0
call phone agents nooo!,0
so game changing you should probably forego the upgrade to prevent the unfavorable gold trade,0
do you really want this instead of another raid tier (or facebook integration)?,0
but remember the game lacked content and absolutely not worth full price.,0
because i'm sure an hour of a mmo game gives you such a great handle on the issues.,0
"3rd q should clearly do no damage, as well as root yasuo to the ground and cut his ad by 75%",0
who doesn't love a good 14-1 side though?,0

you mean my knife doesn't make me better?,0
and what a smooth launch it was.,0
"don't worry, you'll be able to buy the red and black chroma pack for just 590 rp!",0

"yeah, cause no one in all of north america, which includes mexico, watches anything else besides football.",0
"blitz has a phantom dancer, everything is working as intended.",0
are you joking why would riot buff champions instead of nerfing because having all champons in a certain role being useless is great for the game,0
"yeah, jinx was only good for her ult",0
"no, that's not a *real* fps, because it's a nintendo game!",0
the fact that she was a female and attractive is clearly enough evidence that she's a groupie and only whoring herself out for views and using charlie for money,0
why not just have a windows 95 vm?,0
"cataclysm was the end result of trying to make everyone happy, and we all see how well that worked out.",0
"when i use my tax software, i really care the developer enjoyed what he was doing and made sure to thoroughly craft it out",0
"come on guys, can't you see that it resembles a pornstars asshole?",0

because rekkles singlehandedly caused the downfall of elements?,0
"sorry, should have included the",0
"man, sony should just move christmas to this weekend so people can play the game they already have on the system they already own with the psn+ they already subscribed to.",0

so that's what happens to skin profits...,0
dont let noobs keep you down op,0
meanwhile valve is fucking up everything with every new patch,0
i dunno $70 seems a little low...,0
b-but all pc gamers are fat virgin nerds...,0
"iirc they just didnt put it in, cuz yano, racing games dont need that sort of thing",0
you're not challenger why are you here please gtfo you're ruining my high elo conversations.,0
it's time for you to update the prescription on your glasses :\^),0
but matchmaking sucks and always puts the trolls on my team,0
riot keeps sexualising their releases and showing time and time again why they are ruining the esports scene,0
"at what spot, you didn't even put the ct in the picture.",0
liquids logo is so much better..,0
because that aoe slow and aoe snare ult is less reliable than cait's traps.,0
"looks like the knife is causing your fps to be low, if you trade it to me i can see whether it improves fps :)",0
this 1/16th of a second is what is keeping him from getting ge!,0
"the thread about faker flirting is so much more relevant to lol, though",0
"because he is from na, and everyone in na are inoffensive lambs who have never uttered an insult, ever.",0
oh yes... more types of controllers is *exactly* what i want from nintendo,0
ranked only mode that matters every other mode are for filthy casuals,0
i think he is legit just the 64tick or something,0
something your mmr is shit,0

"yeah fnatic is playing so badly, they will disband",0
"easy i do this 300 times a day in bronze, nothing special here",0
no but obviously we are being hateful when we discuss the performance of players in the game thread.,0
"these are the things, that make this game unplayable",0

i was too busy feeling incredibly legendary while doing this quest to notice.,0
"yea, triple q was so fun to play against",0
"oh yeah, those automated bots will totally be able to bring up his transaction history.",0
gaben personal mail is the steam support,0
because america have never gotten involved in foreign issues.,0
it's because too many people illegally download their games,0
"of course they will, why would ea have pc developers develop anything for pc",0
yea or maybe they need an extra time for an extreme huge patch,0
and next someone tells that every battlefield/cod/whatever are the exact same game?,0
it's so weird that you like that game; most people never give it a chance.,0
itll also turn your gpu into a convienent space heater!,0
no but guyz the dfg got removed so this is obviously a buff,0
"no, we need minimalistic artwork from all the maps and angles because then we will make more karma than ever before!",0
global elites are mgs with hacks,0
yes but is the artwork original?,0
"no need to be rude man, he just wants to know the name!",0
imagine the numbers of faceit impersonators show up at your door to 'inspect' and seize your pc/csgo inventory in suspicion of cheating.,0
"yeah their last nerf with leaving his ult stacks on for 20 seconds made him completely unviable, just like reddit said",0
"if it was in 1.6, it is automatically good",1
"i love it, totally worth getting boosted to get promoted to an elo where you lose the game and ruin it for the players that are there legitimately",0
"pfft, any excuse for the corporation huh!",0
html is most definitely a programming language.,0
yes because draenei clearly want to be in the same faction with orcs,0
maybe you should have queued for marquis instead.,0
because he is actually a silver 1.,0
yeah god it's like they expect being able to fucking dodge stuff to be reasonable counter-play.,0
"but i wanna do my gp ap jangle and my ap master le jangle, rito pls buff my jangle chartcrs.",0
-2 new maps added to pool and will be used during katowice,0
thrall didn't steal the kill... let's just say he accidentally tagged him first,0
"yeah, fuck that guy for having an opinion!",0
i'm glad you tried to save sovor some professionalism by trying to actually take in my opinion and respond to that instead of going back to personal jist and ridicule.,0
"take up mining, get a bunch of gold ore, then smelt it into coins.",0
"of course, things change every year with clg, and for the better too!",0
"didn't you know, 14th century icelandic people copyrighted their sagas and other literature.",0

everyone knows you can't have story *and* gameplay that would just be crazy.,0
"they're really good, the game is just unfair to them and its really random who wins and no skill is involved so they use cheats to make it fair so they can show their true skill without the effort required.",0
yes because their playstyle doesnt need to change at all.,0

"you know, because i'm sure that the people with the necessary money to buy the content and not pirate it would turn off the adblock",0
obvs he heard the players with his $1000 headset,0
they did make up for it with november's awesome catalog of free games!,1
they should just release a paid version without ads,0
"oh wow, you're so creative, that's totally not an archaic meme from nearly a decade ago",0
they have to spend extra resources to announce console sales which could have been used to make more games,0
"you guys are right, this was the wrong move representing over 50% of the population.",0
doesn't matter our eyes can only see 30fps,0
"yeah, because infinity ward are so shitty and just produce the worst games right?",0
yeah because infinity ward makes cod and i dont lik that game so that means they're dead!,0
anyone not going to state the obvious...magmadar...which he has targetted.,0

"so bm rito plz fine totally unnecessary could have finished handshake earlier, intentionally speaking to get more screen time .",0
they're obviously too busy eating fried chicken to yell at the screen,0
"the eye has trouble making out the shapes of the letters when not focusing on them, making it hard to read they must have recorded it in a frame rate greater than 30fps - i hear the eye can't make out anything greater than that.",0
so back to the healing mess that cata was...right on blizz!,0
"yeah, because xbox 360 could totally handle tessellation!",0
shoot i don't know if 16 tb is enough!,0

"don't forget to make fiddlesticks immune to cc while he's channeling, gotta level the playing field.",0
"yea, an awp definitely costs the same as a rifle.",0
"because lord knows when a remaster, that can be done by a small team in a short period of time, is started, what ever game they may be working on is put on hold",0

good thing the eye can only see 24 fps,0

omfg i'm so sick of these stealth buffs they are ruining my champs zero counterplay op,0
720p on 30fps is by far superior ^^\.,0
there's no way they can find eye candy in southern cali,0
"well, obviously they should've just remade the game from the ground up!",0
"it means check your privilege, you white, cisgender pig-bigot d;",0
"i think that the community should be free to do what it wants, i mean look at the bastions of quality the defaults are with their minimal moderator intervention",0

"oh shit, you're right, better flash into them",0
i'd care if my cd key was working... thanks steam!,0
oh yes they are losing so much money when i emulate a game they haven't sold for years.,0
they get some good practice from rehashing their games over and over.,0
til muting also prevents teammates from seeing pings!,0
"well the good ones need at least someone to initiate with them to ace you, the great ones just run into your team and get a pentakill.",0
"yeah, i heard travis beats up anyone who doesn't interview with him.",0
"great reply, obviously worth having a debate with you",0
so obviously valve wants to have terrible relationships with the community and to prevent people from wanting to submit anything to the workshop in the first place.,0
that's a much more mature comment than any of mine.,1
because 9mm round can destroy tanks and jets.,0
yup i think we have the next etho,0
"oooh, so those floaty things are called samus!",0
yes exactly why can't everyone have the same music taste as me so i don't have to feel superior when i hear someone listening to le (c)rap?,0
i think they should tone her w down so it has the same cooldown as her ult and make it do no damage so its just used for the root cause lissandra is so broken right now and i don't think i'll ever play this game again until they nerf her...,0
"well, it is not a competitive map and its only use is to goof around..",0
b-b-but he showed me the middle finger d:,0
this is probably a great thread to express such an opinion,0
her neck isn't *nearly* long enough,0
after this last week... i didn't know essex was doing non satirical articles now.,0
"yes, we should add in a feature which requires a great deal of teamwork to one of the most toxic game environments of all time, and expect it to go over well.",0
increasing trinket cooldown is a band aid for this.,0
"man, 57 hours sure is a long time!",0
titanfall is the bestest game ever made and no one dislikes it because it's the best!,1
"what're you talking about, i just love my 150 average ping from the 90-103 i used to get!",0
should have spent less time healing and more time dealing damage ya scrub,0
"good argument, lots of legit points in there, really a lot to ponder in my life.",0
"yes, obviously one person out of 370,374 people is representative of the whole",0

they lost the last two bo3s (one vs c9 and one vs gambit)... yea they are not the same anymore.,0
but you can't do 5 supports on one team!,0
i'm booting up my ddos infrastructure.,0
"but haven't you heard, us sales are the only ones that matter, and xb1 was leading in december.",0
but adc is the most important class everyone should cater to them at all times since they are all the dps!,0
well that sounds like a legit assumption,0
"and it doesn't matter that the enemy has baron and a 5k gold lead, no, instead of turtling and farming and waiting out baron, we must dance in mid vs leona, vi and malph and then blame the vayne for defending the last bottom inhib turret instead of getting caught and dying with the team.",0
"nah, how else would i get to feel superior?",0
"40% of ap ratio on q was deleted; no, you're right, it was totally reasonable, not a knee-jerk overreaction at all.",0
you forgot to post a link to the website and talk about the free credits they are offering.,0
yea screw him for wording his title in a certain way.,0
it should just level up on it's own and the items should be bought automatically aswell.. i even want the game to cast the spells for me so all i have to do is move the champ because this game is sooo hard.,0
well then i guess the fun i had in the beta was shortlived because it's not 1080p in the full game.,0
"nah, using your escape with a 20s cooldown to clear jungle camps is a great idea!",0
yeah because levels designed around waist-high walls every 10 feet is good gameplay.,0
"yeah, fuck those people trying to do a good thing for charity, right?",0
this was certainly incarnati0n's fault.,0
"oh i'm sorry, i just get annoyed when people call me elitist bullshit, it's totally my fault.",0
that's what they're *trying* to get you to do...,0
as if that's the worst think people would see in my room...,0
"yea, like you'll ever meet him in a game.",0
yeah because all cops follow the law.,0
"to be fair, 624.9 is a lot bigger than 40.",0
i'm glad to see you support the cause,0
yes because indie games are amazing and not wasteful.,0
but polygon was supposed to be x1 biased.,0
couldn't i just download the twitch app with the added bonus of getting the wonderful chat experience?,0
it's not like people who don't use bots are affected.,0
this guy knows how game development works,0
qtpie hacked the rp to get all the urgod skins.,0
"human eye can't see more than 1 fps anyways, also it gives the gif a cinematic feeling.",0
"but the traps are spell thief stacks and you have a steal, so you're a support",0
dont worry theyve been lurking and just made one for this ;) lol,0
coc is pretty expensive where i come from,0
and then they ask why eu is better,0
"we're true veterans, we survived 2 days without psn make it happen mods!",0
don't forget the amazing mouse lifting flusha taught him.,0
well this worked really well for us last year so i can't see the fault in this logic.,0
sure thing max bonerstorm ill definitely take your word for it you seem like a smart guy.,0
"yeah, i still remember how velkoz just wrecked everyone on release.",0
oh wow yes the server owners are the ones to blame for this and there is no hypocrisy at all on mojang's side!,0
"with his insane amount of dps, sustain via ability and life steal, nice as steroid and 1v5 carry potential, he certainly isn't.",0

let's boycott all games that do this yeah!,0
"because it's said twenty dollars, not dollars twenty",0
inb4 everypost next month +maj3r -sf,0
