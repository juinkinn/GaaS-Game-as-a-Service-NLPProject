## 1. Project Planning and Environment Setup

### 1.1. Define Objectives & Scope - [x]
- **Objective:** Build a robust sentiment analysis system for social media posts using Distilled BERT.
- **Scope:** 
  - Data collection and preprocessing
  - Model fine-tuning
  - Deployment (locally with containerization option)
  - Monitoring and continuous improvement following LLMOps best practices

### 1.2. Setup Development Environment - []
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
  - PyTorch (as you fine-tune Distilled BERT; TensorFlow can be explored later)
- **Tools:**
  - Git for version control
  - Docker for containerization
  - Virtual environments (e.g., conda or venv)

### 1.3. Repository and Documentation
- Initialize a Git repository with a clear README and structured project directories.
- Document project decisions and progress following the report guidelines (overview, methodology, etc.).

## 2. Data Management & Preprocessing

### 2.1. Data Collection
- **Kaggle Datasets:** 
  - Load your datasets using the Hugging Face Datasets library or Pandas.
- **Additional Sources:**
  - Consider APIs (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) for additional data, ensuring compliance with their usage policies.
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - Generate synthetic data for edge cases if needed.

### 2.2. Data Cleaning & Annotation
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant content.
- Apply text normalization (e.g., lowercasing, punctuation removal).
- Label posts for sentiment if not already provided.
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

### 2.3. Preprocessing Pipeline
- Use the Distilled BERT tokenizer to convert text into model inputs (input IDs, attention masks).
- Utilize the Hugging Face `Datasets` library to build an end-to-end preprocessing pipeline.
- Ensure data validation checks to prevent leakage and bias.

## 3. Model Selection & Fine-Tuning

### 3.1. Choose Distilled BERT
- **Why Distilled BERT?**
  - It is lightweight, fast, and efficient for sentiment analysis tasks.

### 3.2. Fine-Tuning Process
- **Setup:**
  - Use Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API to simplify the training process.
  - Learn PyTorch basics as you fine-tune the model.
- **Fine-Tuning Steps:**
  1. Load the pre-trained Distilled BERT model and tokenizer from Hugging Face.
  2. Prepare your dataset using the preprocessing pipeline.
  3. Define training arguments (e.g., batch size, learning rate, epochs).
  4. Train and validate your model, monitoring loss and accuracy.
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Explore strategies like LoRA or adapters for resource optimization if needed.
- **Versioning:**
  - Maintain version control for your models, saving checkpoints and logs.

## 4. Model Deployment & Inference Optimization

### 4.1. Local Deployment
- **API Server:**
  - Use frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI to create an API endpoint for model inference.
- **Inference Pipeline:**
  - Load your fine-tuned model and preprocess incoming social media posts in real-time.
- **Optimization:**
  - Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequent queries.

### 4.2. Containerization
- **Docker:**
  - Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application.
  - Include dependencies, model files, and API server setup in your container.
- **Testing:**
  - Run and test your Docker container locally to ensure accessibility and performance.

### 4.3. Scalability Considerations
- Investigate lightweight inference frameworks (e.g., vLLM or Triton) for future scaling.

## 5. Monitoring & Observability

### 5.1. Logging & Metrics Collection
- Integrate logging (using Python’s `logging` module or dedicated libraries) to capture inference times, errors, and predictions.
- Track key performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and sentiment distribution.

### 5.2. Real-Time Monitoring
- Use dashboard tools like Grafana combined with Prometheus for monitoring.
- Store logs and metrics for regular analysis and feedback.

### 5.3. Feedback Loop
- Collect user feedback to detect misclassifications or biases.
- Set up anomaly detection to monitor for unexpected output patterns or performance drifts.

## 6. Continuous Improvement & Automation

### 6.1. CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up automated testing (unit and integration tests) for your data processing and API endpoints.
- Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate training, testing, and deployment processes.

### 6.2. Retraining Strategies
- Schedule periodic retraining sessions with new data.
- Automate data collection and preprocessing to ensure continuous improvements.

### 6.3. Experimentation
- Maintain a systematic approach for experimenting with different hyperparameters, architectures, or optimization techniques.
- Document experiments and outcomes to iterate and improve the model performance.
