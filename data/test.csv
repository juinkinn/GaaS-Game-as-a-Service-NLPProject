15227,"absolute trash. ai always lands on the perfect tile for the time. either to purchase it just before you land a turn later to pay up or to magically avoid 8 of 9 tiles you own 20+ times in a row.9 of 10 players use some game engine sht so you land in jail on first turn and miss all property tiles the first 80+ turns until they have the entire board and you have nothing at all. play a few games youll catch on to the bullsht quick.edit: take my advice and dont join games with any players from or in brazil. every person i suspected of cheating just magically happen to be from brazil. all 9 cheaters all from the same place. who'd have guessed...attempt number 2: started a game and got 3 guys from france all friends vs just me. all attacking just me.some guy who used special characters to avoid a steam ban name was vulgar -> fr except circles around the vulgar text and the arrow was an actual arrow all of which cant be typed on a keyboard. his sockpuppet you59120 and his other sockpuppet keszofr vs only me. every chance card went against my 3 very poor 1 house cities all while they avoided each other and didnt give a . in fact to push things further as soon as id lost the two puppets forfeit the game giving t untypable text name vulgar->fr (no spaces) all the chips.--attempt number 3. faced 1 of 228,000 idiots on steam named tape face. with a black hair black & white stripes shirt image that appearently hundreds more idiots on steam use.incident-> he landed repeatedly on world tour 5 times in a row. in a ing row and consecutively!!! as in so many times he went from no property to owning the entire same line london to newyork. yes picked each tile and landed on world tour after each purchase no fail. then landed on chance from newyork purchase on doubles and drew select city for world championships. which i then landed on london which just happened to be a festival that he just chose a turn before to be the championships.yes all turn by turn no fail no pause pure impossible t!the rest the game he landed 2 in 7 turns on a 25,000 property while i landed upwards of 3 times per pass on those same properties london to newyork.its always the cheating ing dip that use either non keyboard text in their name so you cant report/block ect. or the choose a name that's used by a million other users with an image a million other idiots use that use cheats and stupid",0
4816,"even though it says how many hours i have played in steam... i have played a countless many more when it was not a steam game. smite is a very addicting and rewarding experience. yes, it can be very frustrating at times due to how the community can be, but that is with any competetive game. even though it is a bit dated now, the graphics still are great in my opinion and the game can run on pretty much any basic game machine. learning the different gods truly can be a craft and that alone is an addiction in itself. i highly recommend smite compared to the other moba's simply because of the 3rd person view. you really take control of your toon much more so than any other moba.",1
13615,"notepreviously i've written a review of this game which was severely negative and was based on other negative reviews. i didn't bother playing the game at first due to being unable to connect to any world, and it turned out that the problem was from my isp. i had to use a vpn to be able to play the game, otherwise i'd be spammed with connection timed out.also, what's the deal with some people stating that the shop is annoying? nothing happened with me. additionally, this game is not pay to win. at least, so far, i've not seen anything that makes you win.i am still new to this game, so this review is definitely going to be updated in the near future.creativerse and minecraftlet me just clear up one thing:many people here compare this game to minecraft and think that this game is a clone of it. well, it's not. here's why:minecraft is a voxel-based game, and so is creativerse. however, many of the core elements between creativerse and minecraft are completely different and irrelevant to each other. if this game featured pickaxes, and mobs such as skeletons and zombies, then you can say it is trying to copy minecraft, but it doesn't.an example of a minecraft clone would be minetest. that is clearly a minecraft clone. both games vary in play-style, even when they're both based on the same concept!comparing minecraft to creativerse is like comparing apples an oranges (classic example). stop calling it a minecraft clone, morons. the review creativerse is a voxel-based survival game, with good lighting, animation, water effects, as well as toon graphics. every new player that first looks at this game judges immediately that this game is similar to minecraft, and it is (note the difference between clone and similar). the game is fully online, and as such, nothing is stored in your computer. as you first enter this game, you will be immediately assigned a world that is stored online and not in your computer. what is lovely is that you can allow other players to join your world, and you can also join other people's worlds.i am going to review the ui, play-style and some elements of the game i found intriguing. note that i just started playing this game, and already i am starting to see how wrong i was when i first made that terrible review.user interfacethe user-interface is pretty. compared to many games, the developers put some effort into making everything pretty and nice to look at. everything is well organized.crafting interface is neat, and the crafting system is simple, but it can be easy to get lost in. thankfully, there is a search option.play-styleplay-style of the game is unique. each player starts with a touchstone that could be used to teleport an infinite amount of times, and other players can also teleport to them.rather than use your traditional crafting table to create other items, you need to craft a processor that processes your materials into other materials.ore in this game require to be mined using a device called an ore extractor, rather than use the mining device.when you run and stop, you don't stop immediately, you slightly slide forward.combat is tough and tricky, even pigs attack you, and landing a hit without getting hurt is difficult, but possible. elements of the game i liked blueprintsi loved the blueprints! but what i didn't like is that only the developers can supply blueprints, but other players cannot. hopefully in the future players would be able to share their own creations for others to build out of.",1

7641,"lmao, ignore these reviewers.(im from beta, the non-steam version. ignore my hours.)is it pay to win?-theres not even a win, honestly. -no level lock. (max level is 20, and then whatever your gear is forged to.)-no classes you can't have.(you can craft then with rare recorces, half of them very easiliy. time consuming, but you could get the supplies in a day if you really wanted. plus frankly, if you join a club people often will help you out assuming you can make friends.)-patreon status only gives small bonuses, like 50% more exp, 2 more max hp flasks, craft faster. etc. (you can also get patreon 1-3 day passes by rare chance in chests)-a lot of the smaller things you can buy you can loot from chests.no, its not pay to win. unless you consider a few mounts winning.shut up and play it, its free.",1

13635,"this game is absolutely amazing! do not think of it as a minecraft clone, i would say it's better than minecraft in the survival department, there is no creative mode though, you can turn on special settings for your world to make it really easy to gather resources and build though. every time that you create a world a server is created, this makes it really easy to let your friends play with you, just give them the password and name of your world and they can play with you. the combat in this game is also really great, you can't just click a few times in front of an enemy and kill them, you have to jump and dodge the enemy's attacks as well as striking blows at their back, this game also has a lot of value in its free to play package with many blocks, crafting machines, weapons, tools, enemies, areas, and resources to keep with you or in storage. creativerse also runs very well, i have 4 gb of ram and the game only has a few moments when it lags, those moments are during world generation, if you have a beast pc you could run this game smooth as butter on high settings. overall, this is the most fun survival sandbox game i have ever played. ps, the game has a great community as well",1

11857,"hello all this is my opinion of the game. take what i say into consideration before purchasing this game. week 1- major issues was happening not anything new to a new mmo launch. fixed pretty quick to say the least apart from other mmo's i have played.week 2- was ok i believe pvp started up got to experience it and wasnt bad but some classes were op and considering this game is focused on pvp. it didnt meet alot of players expectations but pvp is hard to balance but pvp was the only end game there.week 3-4- devs kicked half if not all emissarys some deserved to be kicked and some didnt. emissarys are post to give feedback positive or negative, if the dev team cant communicate to emissarys then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it was executed right. gameplay- i thought the gameplay was smooth although huge fps problems for alot of people including me i felt optimization could of been better for a early access game that was mostly done just a few minor fixes here and there but that was not the case.combat- was ok kinda felt clunky even switching stances felt clunky to me. combat was a slow/fast pace mix when using skills but overall pretty fun.taming- brillant idea that i hate to see go to waste loved this aspect of the game. you could capture anything just about in the game. hope to see other mmos use this idea but make it even better although idk how you could make it even better haha. crafting- it was simple i liked that not really into lifeskills that much dungeons- were pretty difficult after a few patches but the loot was meh even for the last dungeon.this game failed because of poor communication from devs, youtubers who only play to lvl 20, and so forth. but i can not recommend this game in its current state. i hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it. took to big of a hit.",0

8357,"i am never a great fan of the 4th edition mechanics in dungeons and dragons but, neverwinter has managed to convience me that it works as an action rpg in a persistant mmo setting.neverwinter is strongly based on the neverwinter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy mmorpg gameplay together with fresh tried and tested approach from star trek online and champions online.while i am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like granado espada and maple story, cryptic's unique approach of astral diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players. however, i do question the motive and causality of making astral diaminds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place.another feature borrowed from cryptic's other games, is the introduction of the foundary. a virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy. there are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players.this feature is powerful enough to recreate entire dungeon and dragon modules written for table top play to exist in neverwinter.like star trek online, i am really cautious in approaching this game. at this stage, neverwinter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics. but cryptic has demostrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem dungeons and drangons in the mmorpg market.",1

10769,"pros:+ the few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ similar to magic the gatheringcons:- most games go into top deck mode- mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- legendaries are very expensive- stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed: think this is very misguided. ccgs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. take league of legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. as far as i am concerned, every match where i'm mana screwed is the same. i have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.since the playerbase is comprised of mostly magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.another praise i often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why i became interested in the first place. again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.verdict:overall, eternal is a near exact copy of magic. to me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. however, i cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from magic.",0

23330,"as a psychologist i find these interactions between male and female gamers very weird. they very often have this outlook that the men saying these stuff are toxic or manipulative, and the girls are victims of this approach. what i often see is that these men have very little social skills. they try their best to get in touch with these girls, whom they view as strong, desirable and competent, in a way that they think is good. some of them have really learnt that mario(no joke) and link are good role models. not because they are depictions of how men actually behave, but because a lot of these boys and men have lacked a proper positive masculine role model in their real life. they use what they know. a man or boy being overly chivalrous, to a point where its weird even, is probably doing so because he has a very positive view of the girl he is talking to. and in his mind being kind and a good man(hero) for this girl means being chivalrous, coming to her aid, like mario or link(especially link is a very relatable character as he is brave, handsome and strong). to me this is nothing to make fun of. its rather very sad to see these boys and men try their best to reach out to someone they view as highly positive, and are left being made fun of and misunderstood. and make no mistake about it - you girls are viewed as positive! some of these men might be weird, make you feel uncomfortable, some even toxic making gestures or approaches that is highly inappropriate. being a girl meeting these men(online) is often difficult and very taxing because the men are lacking social skills that creates a good atmosphere. since its the girls who know better in that situation they are the ones that finds it most uncomfortable. but, almost all the time their approaches and behaviour stems from them viewing you as positive. not just attractive, but positive. girls are viewed as kinder, emotionally smarter, easier to talk to, safer. a girl is a good friend too, and a lot of these men are missing that. like they are sitting alone in the sandbox in kindergarten. and when they are weird, they are trying their best. when they ask if you have a boyfriend its their best attempt to find out if they can move closer or not. if they are toxic its because they often are angry that they are missing the positives a girl represents in their own life. girls are in this story so much stronger than these men. it is these mens responsibility to mature and learn other ways to talk to girls, especially online. but it is so important to understand where these boys and men are coming from, to see the value they put on to you women. it is a sadness to see posts like this, because it makes it clear how these men are perceived. them reaching out and doing their best comes across as weird and toxic. imagine how much they struggle to get in touch with people, girls in particular. imagine how lonely they are. in my experience knowing where a behaviour comes from makes handling the impact of that behaviour a lot easier. understand that a toxic man is being so because he finds what a woman represents unattainable. its a positive excluded from him. downgrading female gamers is his way of dealing with that loss. i dont care anyway, i dont need a girl in my life, they suck!. now he can believe that he can be okey without. try to notice that dynamic, and see if you can feel some compassion for how isolated some of them feel. if you do, the toxic man is shown for the sad boy he feels to be, and his comments no longer as threatening.",1

7141,"the card game itself is pretty fun and enjoyable. however despite this game being f2p with microtransactions they still charge for dlc (dark brotherhood story line) which i cannot get behind. another issue that i have is that instead of having smart ai, ai will just cheat to pose a challenge, doing things such as hand peeking, luckier draws, and no card limits which isn't really fun to play against. lastly anyone who enjoys card games but doesn't enjoy doing 1v1s with random people online and would prefer to play against bots will find themselves only able to 'practice' with ai for pitiful win rewards once they complete the included storyline. i really enjoyed the 'campaign' of this game but again find it silly that i'd have to play $8 for the dark brotherhood storyline when the game is also trying to get me to buy card packs and event tickets.good game, terrible microtransaction system and ai coding.",0
6919,"the only thing remotely interesting about this game is the pve arena (all of the pvp is 1-dimensional because the lack of viable decks).unfortunately, like so many other card games, the developers have no idea how to balance the ai. every pve game is an rng match. when it's a game you're supposed to lose, the ai will draw insanely improbable combinations of cards... every time, and you'll never have a chance.when it's your turn to win, you'll blow through the ai without a thought.don't spend any money on this one -- it's soon to be gone for good anyway.",0

14390,"okay so robocraft used to be a good game. that is as simple as i can make this. i used to love logging in and building robots and fighting against other people, seeing creativity and combat come together like some brilliant child fantasy of building things out of lego and smashing them together, or whatever. but seriously, what the f*** happened? after about 5 good games of robocraft i could walk away with on average around 200,000 to 500,000 in the game currency and buy loads of cool items and build loads of new robots with crazy designs. but. now it's so disgusting, the entire combat sytem is somewhat still enjoyable, but now, you've got to be so good at the game to get some weird loot reward thing at the end of a match to get items that you don't even want. i think in one game i was rewarded a 'protanium chest' or whatever (which i beleive is the best loot box you can get) and i got absolutely f*** all in it. i sold the crap from the box for abour 2,000 'robits'. how the hell are new people playing the game supposed to get money to build a robot? i'm stuck with the three worst robots in exsistence and i can't do f*** all about it. i'm struggling to fight againts people who were lucky enough to have a good robot built before this 'apocalype' update occured. this game seriously needs to be fixed, like back to the way it used to be when you could actually get money to upgrade your bots and do well in matches so you can actually have fun. honestly, the people behind this game are absolute idiots, they need to wake up and realise that what they are doing is putting players off completely. i do not recommend this game at all. however i do recomend that you cry like a baby like me so that we players who used to love the game can enjoy it once more. thanks.",0

897,"there's not a lot of space games on the market that many can get behind. somewhere down the line, devs effectively equated space with complexity, so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets, graphs, and pure busywork. however the genre continues to be an itch i can rarely scratch with the rare exception (rebel galaxy being one).this is another. as the synopsis demonstrates, this is a creep-less moba. it has much of the staples. zone control for resources, except those 'resources' mostly translate to 'team experience'. you zone back to a base in order to 'level up', comparable to how you buy items in dota or lol. after that, it's just a 5v5 beat'em up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment. like many space games, you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage you'd otherwise receive. like with many team-based games, it's more fun when you play with friends. when pugging, i lost against ai because everyone pulled a lone wolf mentality that just does not work here. a lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support. a tank ship cannot 1v2 unless he has a support ship on his back. one match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back (as they should) but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us. the list goes on.there is also no pay to win here. at best, with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra 10% utility here, some 4% damage there, and only serves for diehard minmaxers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs. the real game here is to pick a few of your favorite ships, adapt to their styles, and just win with superior skill, and it won't matter if an enemy does an extra 6% damage or not.everything else is mostly cosmetic, with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other f2p.one of the things i want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the game's playability or mechanics - but the ship designs are some of the best i've seen in a long time. just opening the game's tutorial giving the overview of the pioneer gave me some epic feelings. and then just looking at ships from the hangar menu, you can tell a lot of love went into their designs. every inch is covered. you can see storage bays, lights under metal panels, antennae. kudos to the designers.i've met many like me, needing a space game without it feeling like a second job. this one fits the bill. space moba. that's what it is.",1

8181,"oh where to begin with neverwinter. now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.neverwinter is a f2p mmorpg published by perfect world. now a lot of perfect world games tend to be pay to win to the extreme. neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. the only thing to win in neverwinter is pvp, but pvp isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp. of course neverwinter has an in-game currency called zen that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing zen lets you buy are fashion items, dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. now of course like many other mmos, in game currencies like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. is that pay to win? no, it is not. what are you winning? a race to the quest area? people do not like spending real life money on mmos, but the game is free is it not? so complaining is silly. anways, the main currency in neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called astral diamonds. you don't want to spend real life money on neverwinter? have no fear, with ad you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. though for a price. 25k ad is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a purple item. purple items sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill. so really, earning ad is not an issue. me? i've played neverwinter since beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items i desired. i just played the game and earned ad, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. the point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. but many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. i also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade ad for zen? isn't that nice that neverwinter allows you to do that? they give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. i don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a free game. in game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! now lets talk about the workers behind neverwinter that are really a great group of people. they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. the employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. its very important for a game to have that. they also play neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. how cool is that? they also stream on twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like t-shirts. so overall, neverwinter is one of the best free to play mmos out right now. there's a reason i've been playing this game since beta. it even has an epic story line unlike many other mmos that don't. like everybody else, i skip dialog, i don't care, i just want to play. with neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. don't believe me? check out my screenshots and look at my neverwinter ones. you'll also see that i have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning ad.like mmorpgs? want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? do you like dungeons and dragons? then take the time to play neverwinter",1
14920,"it's hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played ever-so-often. they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i. i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made, and that these team-based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times, as every time i upgraded my parts, i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do. trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted, and flight is just as bad. there is no way in hell, as a beginner class, are you going to be able to fly decently in this game, especially after the most recent patches i last saw. the game's devs have basically ed with the game so much, that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it (which was two years ago). it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with. (in other words: if it isn't broken, don't fix it).and it's surprisingly still in early access.i still don't understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement, because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it.the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot, whether on wheels, feet, or in the air; the creativity part of this game is what makes it good. the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are, which, in order to get any more of these things, you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts, and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs. how much you actually get per round.",0

4322,"i have over a thousand hours logged on the android version, and have sunk a couple of hundred bucks into the game; so let me be frank.this is one of the only thing konami has done in the past 5 years that wasn't an utter disaster. duel links is a truly good iteration of the original yu-gi-oh series; the format has been compressed and stream lined, such as a 30 card deck limi, three spaces for monster and trap cards, the removal of phases; but it works, and it works really well. most of your favorite cards are there, with more being added monthly to bi-monthly, and you can use all of your old strategies to really unleash a serious beat down on your opponents. even though it's konami, the game isn't money hungry either. gems are used to buy card packs, but they come in an abundance. free events, all the time; give aways that require you to do nothing, log in bonuses, rank up bonuses. you don't have to spend a cent to get ahead.likely though, you will. i don't know what sort of devil magic konami used to polish this as much as it is, but it worked. i wanted to drop money to support the game, to open new card packs and get excited when i pulled ultra and super rares. i wanted to drop just five more dollars on the promotinal 5 for 10 + sr packs.the last thing i want to talk about is ranked- it works really, really well. you will find matches near instantly, with little down time. unless the opponent tries to stall, turns move quickly, too- and with the inclusion of the stall busting timer, they can't indefinately lock you in until you quit, otherwise they'll take an automatic loss. it's never a problem for players who take a little extra time to think of a strategy though, so worry not. all in all, this might be a better title than some of the console iterations- they've recently added a gx section- though it's completely seperate from the original world, which means going forward, even if they add new series to the game, it isn't going to impact the series you enjoy playing. you won't have to contest with synchro monsters when they're introduced using your og yugioh cards. in this sense, it makes every battle feel equal, you dont feel like your cards are going to become obsolete. it's a must try if you're a yu-gi-oh fan. even if you're not, but you have a casual interest in the card game via nostalgia or curiosity, it's worth your time to check out, most definately.",1
5356,"gave it a try, and sadly its the same old bad world of tanks game. the only good thing about it is the fun killing artillary is removed. beyond that, its the same unbalanced bad match making game its always been. battles are just a mish mash of every sort of tank, from every nation and era, and of differing tiers, that create battles that are often so unbalanced that there is no battle. one group of tanks simply gets to take out the other group, and all the victims can do is try to run or scratch their killers paint with a couple shots. not fun for any player actually looking for good gameplay. why wot thinks this is a good gameplay model is beyond me. this game has so much more potential if wot would put some effort into balancing their match making system. like putting nations together into teams, and put tanks together of the same time period and crew skill level. and no multi-tier'ed matches. the game seems like it was being built to be like that, but the devs quit and put this out instead.",0

10961,"tldr: one of the best card games out there. not recommended due to flawed (apparently unfixable) core mana/power mechanic.comparisons to mtg and hearthstone barely do it justice. while it drew inspiration from the two, the varied mechanics make every faction/color fight on equal footing. from aggro to midrange, or even late game mammoth decks, they all clash for a piece of the pie.well, the same is valid for every card game! what makes this one special?the sheer feel of power your cards give. compared to any other ccg, the strength of these cards is absurd. the feed-back you get from your deck (when you win) is that you stomped the opponent, even if the game was close. while losing has the reverse effect, the game doesn't let you dwell on the past. rewards are given with every occasion: single player campaigns, ai games, first win of the day, and so on. youll have to keep your aspirations to a top tier place in check tough. getting a decent collection still requires investment (time and/or money), as in every ccg.other players have said more positives about the game than i could write in a limited space.as such, i will focus on why i gave it a negative mark.like mtg, it suffers from power fixing issues: you either get too much or too little (mana/power flood or screw). they mended the algorithm several times, and yet, it is far from working. i wont quote other players or streamers; suffice to say the issue is real. the amount of games lost due to mana/power issues is enough to make the grind tiring and unpleasant. as strange as it sounds, its even sadder when the opponent has it. adding these losses up, you end up with a simple question: why isnt there anything being done? well, there is. maybe. the communications regarding the issue is minimal. for me, the bigger question is why they chose the classical (mtg) style of mana/power fixing knowing the flaw it has. more so considering some of the main developers are former mtg players.the game is beautiful: fun mechanics, captivating games, great feed-back and rewards. but all of it is diminished to a zero line by its flawed core mechanic: mana/power fixing. a flaw i dont believe will ever be fixed.prove me wrong.",0

(you can also hunt cottontail rabbits and european rabbits as a guest however you cannot use the starter rifle to do so) there are currently 9 different hunting reserves in the game, logger's point being the one where you will find mule deer to hunt for free, use this map once you get hooked and wish to hunt other animals you need to spend money! (hey dev's gotta eat!), personally at the moment i'm only interested in hunting deer, so i purchased a 3month membership for 6.99 (that's 2.33 a month, less than half the price of a fast food burger each month) and i can hunt all animals in all reserves. on top of that i bought a .300 bolt action rifle & snakebite bow which cost 1100 em$ (2000 em$ costs 13.70 so you'll have 900 left for other stuff) and can now hunt everything with the bow and all deer with the rifle on all of the reserves.if you like hunting games you're probably familiar with deer hunter 2005, for me this was the best hunting game of all time, and now thehunter is scratching that itch i had, i'm playing every night lately, loving the atmosphere, the graphics, the audio, the daily competitions and leaderboards, the multiplayer and the hunt for that big buck!simply put, if you like hunting games, this is pretty much the best one around and i've tried a lot, don't be put off with all the negative comments, the game is free to play with limits but if you spend wisely you can get a lot out of this game for a very reasonable price.",1

7987,the gameplay is addictive and quick. they have 13 races to choose from (4 of them need to be purchased from the store) and 8 classes to choose from. decent customization for each race. there can be a lot for you to do in the game. whether your a casual like me or hardcore player. from leveling to 70 while doing quest or instances and skirmishes. the game has a pvp function. once you get to 70 you open up campaigns to do which are story driven quest that unlock dailies and additional skills via boons. then you also have artifact weapons and other items you can level up and turn them from a green quality to a poweful legendary. all of this can be done with out even spending a dime. of course if you do spend money it can speed up the amount of time certain things are done. but it doesnt give you an advantage over anyone that doesnt spend any money. ive been able to level characters to 60-70 across all platforms on console and pc and i only spent 20 dollars on 2 months of subscriptions. they are updating the game frequently and quickly.,1

14615,"do not play this gamerobocraft is no longer worth playing and here's why. before the epic loot update players used to earn in-game currency(rp) after battle. do well, earn more rp. use rp to buy parts with which to build bigger and better robots. after the epic loot update players now earn crates after battle instead of currency. these crates are filled with a handful of random parts. so do you want a missile launcher for example? cross your fingers and hope the random number generator gives you one. no more simply buying a missile launcher. the crates will be filled with complete garbage you don't need and can't use 99.99% of the time. you can recycle unwanted parts(most will be unwanted) into robits that can be used to directly buy parts, but recycling yields insanely low sums of robits. it's like the pocket change you get from trading a game in to gamestop... but even worse. thanks to crates it's basically impossible for newer players to progress. if you want to build a better bot then you're totally at the mercy of the random number generator giving you random parts, and the useful parts are rare. imagine you want to build a flying bot and every crate you win contains everything except wings. a crate is really just a gamble; there's a tiny chance you'll get a part you need and a very big chance that you won't. you can open up your wallet and cough up real world money to buy crates(this is how the developers, freejam, monetize robocraft now), but it doesn't even help. somebody on the official robocraft forum purchased 300 crates and he didn't even get enough parts from them to build a functional bot. let that sink in. crates could deny you the parts you need for months, possibly years. i don't know what freejam was smoking. nobody except freejam knows that. the whole epic loot update should, by all rights, go down as one of the worst blunders in gaming history. right up there with the sega 32x. i'm not joking. the whole player base is up in arms over it and people are quitting left and right. do not play robocraft until freej brings back rp. as long as the crate system exists newbies will have a terrible time, veterans will have a terrible time, everyone will have a terrible time. robocraft is currently dead. will freejam realize they royally screwed up and make it rise from the ashes? let's hope so.",0

935,"i was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):my opinion: solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad. if played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. if you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. the devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game. the negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. but really my negatives are limited to that and i do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions. i suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. but when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. a lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. if anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. if i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what i see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. this isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect. since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.microtransactions: limited to skins essentially, you can't simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. there is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1

7044,"pros- very fair f2p/p2w model. the intructory story/tutorial is alright, just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda, but the game deserves praise for giving you access to a generous number of 50 cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start (or at least, after finishing the tutorial). you can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of skyrim expansion with in-game currency, in less than 30 hours of gameplay i was able to buy two of these decks for 1000 coins, which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorial/story. -great art, tes designs at their best. each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at, and they all come with accompanying sound effects and/or voice over. - the game's rng is one hell of an important factor in winning games. there's a big overlap between what a common card can do when rng favors it and what a legendary card can do when rng is not in its favor. what this means is that you absolutely do not need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it. good cards give you an edge, but good deck synergy and rng still reign supreme.-great card/deck identity. the game really benefit from the tes theme, each card and deck built around it oozes personality, and each combination of different races (or lack of) yields a solid, recognizable theme, different from all others. recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game. this ties into the game's balance: learn to pace your decisions. every deck has a certain rhythm to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains. learn them to make the most of each deck. cons- way, way, way too many rng mechanics. yes, this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game, but you'll eventually be on the receiving end of the rng beating. numerous cards have effects such as summoning a random creature. no, not a random creature from your deck, any random creature from the entire game. you will get screwed over by a hail mary at some point, you need to learn to accept that. this also ties into the next con:- built in comeback mechanic. as you burn through your opponent's life points, you'll break a total of 5 runes. each time you break a rune, your oponent draws a card. if your opponents card is a prophecy card, they'll be able to play it immediately with no cost. this can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly, so most of the game's meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times. you are never entirely safe.overall, i recommend the game to all fans of tcg games. if you ever played a tcg game, you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition, and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it, and you don't have to pay a price of entry just to see if it's going to appeal to you.",1

14217,"hi, this is a free to play game, and i recommend it if you like being sniped all the time, the regular players have complained that there are too many sniper weapons in the game, so the developers have made it difficult to get hold of one, the only way you can get a sniper weapon is if you enter pvp and kill another player that has one, good luck with that one you'll need it and the other way is to kill a super zombie that on it's death will drop a number of weapons but does'nt always drop a sniper weapon, you'll need even more luck with that make sure you got plenty of ammo cuz it takes over 100 bullets to kill a super zombie and what makes it harder is other players cuz they are more dangerous than the zombies, they will kill you on sight so don't try to make friends with anyone cuz you'll end up dead and when you die you lose all your weapons, but you can get them back when you rejoin if you survive long enough without getting sniped by someone and the regular players still thinks there are too many sniper weapons in the game, i've played it for a week and starting to lose interest now very frustrating game to play at the moment unless changes are made about the spawning of sniper weapons. 3/10",0

11571,"positives---black squad is a game that has potential to become one of the better if not top f2p online fps games similar to soldier front 2 and arctic warfare...both of which no longer exist in na. the game has multiple modes such as tdm, 8v8, and 5v5 to name a few, however this game is played mostly for the competitive 5v5 mode. black squad is one of the few games that has very balanced guns with the exception of a few guns of minor superiority. how is this game not pay2win? well sure, there is a cash shop for bullet currency that gives you the opportunity to get a head start on the premium weapons as well as skins for the standard guns. however! all the premium guns can be bought by medal currency which is generously given to you for, leveling up, daily missions and weekly missions making it possible to get your first premium gun such as the sr47, ak12 or 47, mdr, or the mpx by level 11 at least. the premium guns are however, harder to control and are no way similar to the superiority of the ak and m4 in csgo. this game has(d) a fairly decent following and competitive scene in korea as well as indonesia and i highly recommend watching some videos of their matches to get an idea of how high the skill cap is for black squad as the game can be very unforgiving similar to csgo.negatives (can be a huge turn off for some)---2 words ->toxic communityit pains me to say this, but this game suffers from some of the worst toxicity i've ever encountered in a f2p online fps game...which is a shame because this may infact turn off a lot of players due to how prevalent it is especially in 5v5 matches. there really should be no reason for people to be so toxic, but...we all know that 95% of the online fps community is filled with 12-17 year old kids living in their parents home who get bullied at school for being a loser and want to take it out on everyone they meet in a video game...sorry not sorry. obviously the best thing to do is to ignore them, but i apologize that anyone has to deal with this spoiled bahavior as it can create discomfort and lessen your enjoyment of this otherwise great game! side note!---hackers may or may not exist, but for the most part i have not had any problems with said hackers and more so find that most of my deaths are from making mistakes or getting unlucky so...take this as you will, but try to take the assumption that you need to improve and that the players are better than you rather than call them hackers and defeat yourself. the worst that can happen if you try regardless is that you'll lose that one match, but still improve in some way.",1

3023,"86/100 - yeah's pretty good.i guess i should probably say something about this game since my play time.i'll try keep it short but here goes.positives:-lots to do, lots to achieve. over 800 vehicles. if you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as warframe or runescape (not as crazy as runescape though) this is a great time sink. it's kept my interest for a while now.-best pre-ww2 to cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soon) out there. it has its faults but compared to other free to games out there i honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. it becomes fulfilling -good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. runs well on most systems too.-free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. the options for free to play are quite forgiving.cons:-is6. (hate that thing) in all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. it's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. updates are frequent and the pr has gotten much better, gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-you must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with american mid-tier planes (my god.) be prepared for people you can't rely on.tips:-you must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-don't claim russian bias when you die to a russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. i guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-is-6's, t29's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -the youtube community is great for tips, i recommend slickbee, theorangedoom, napalmratte, phlydaily, squire, mcchickenbites to name a few.it's hard to condense what i think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then i do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. if you've played world of tanks or other free to plays that are around ww2 era this will stand out for you.thanks for reading this far. feel free to murder me in the comments.",1

1931,"when i started playing dota 2 i absolutely hated it. i refused to play it. no one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. during the international 3, i decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. orange tearing through the losers bracket, taking out dk and pushing towards the finals. the commentators were going wild, i had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but i knew it was epic. this brought me back to the game. we're now in the middle of the international 4 a n entire year later, i now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my dotabuff.dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. it's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. when you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. you'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. but there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. these games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. the community isn't as bad as other mobas, but it's very easy to blame other people. if you win, people will sing your praises through the game. if you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself. i've played a fair amount of mobas, from league of legends and hon to the more abstract awesomenauts and smashmuck champions. dota 2 has to be rated as the best. it's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. you can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics. the game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. this is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. there is a very steep learning curve. you also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. you will learn this with experience. i have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and i still don't know a lot of things about the game. i still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and i don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. it takes time and patience. dota 2. it's a game i grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. the competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. and the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other mobas that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience. easily recommended, but just be wary and try to keep your team mates relaxed and mediate them during those bad losses. you can't win every game.",1

12201,"i think people are highly going overboard with the negative reviews the games still in early access/still being added to and adjusted and some how in 1-2 days people think they know everything about it and that its problems will never get fixed.firstly i must say out of all the early access games ive played in the last few years this has been one of the better ones if not the best only one or two maitenances on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day. (roughly about 2 hours all in all it was down for on the first night for maitenances.) so i think its doing fine.the game itself is quite fun theres a bunch of things to do nothing that hasnt been done before but still a variety and it doesnt feel like a massive chore. the combat is fun for a tab target game the combo system makes it interesting. i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a buttonmash fest and you have to think about what your using and how to utilise the stances to get the most of possible. the problems atm are quite normal for any recently released mmo and i can deal with that it will get better with time only problem i have which is just a preference is that some classes i want to play arent out. (mostly assassin) but thats not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out.another issue i would like to pick up on though this failed in other regions and is a old game according to some its been tweaked quite a bit for us and they keep on tweaking it just have patience, i still feel like it has promise and i hope people give it a go because neowiz are actually really trying as a company to live up to what people here want which is suprising since i cant think of many companies who would actually go to the lengths they did to make this build of the game for us. it is similar but at the same time very different to the other builds it has in other regions i hope it has a steady success and helps people remember what mmos are for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it pvp/pve or other.",1

6815,"this game just can't get my recommendation. i'd leave it at neutral if i could. the game itself is fun. you got vehicles and explosions all about. i enjoy that it does retain some sense of realism to it. here's why i'm neutral on it: the best teams to join in when you start off the game is american. if you start off as soviet union or germany though, you will probably not see victories unless the opposing team has way less members than you, or until you reach the point of seeing automatic weapons on your team being used. when you join a match, you'll begin to realize that the americans have fully automatic weapons and even vehicles with mgs on them. as for the soviets? well, we start off with semi automatic rifles and jeeps/trucks that serve no purpose other than transport. why is this a problem? a lot of the starting battles take place at close range so the full auto guns have complete advantage over the soviet union. the armed vehicles actually suppress and deteriorate any advance made by soviet union. you could say get skill but really, it wouldn't matter. you can be extremely skilled and yet, be so limited due to the crappy soviet loadout. it seems you would actually need to pay to win as the soviets. so unless i begin to see the starter battles look less biased towards americans, my opinion won't change.",0

9488,"realm of the mad god is a medieval-themed rogue-like with 2d pixel graphics. there is no story or campaign, only some background lore. the object in the game is to wreck havoc and kill creatures on a huge island (the realm). these creatures are oryx's (the mad god) minions. killing them will earn exp and drop some occasional loot. killing tougher monsters (gods) willoryx off (hence the name: mad god). when angry, oryx will teleport the players on the island to his castle, where they will attempt to kill oryx. when succeeded, players will teleport to another realm, starting the chain again.the game is proper fun for the first couple of hours. after that the flaws will start to point out, including annoyingly repeatitive soundtrack. it is less than two minutes long 8-bit chant.-there are too few levels (only 20), and the highest level will be achieved in just a couple of hours, tops. each level-up will give you higher stats, determined by your class. even after reaching lvl 20, you can still get your stats higher by consuming stat potions. the stats will eventually max out, making the corresponding number turn gold/yellow.-the equippable items are quite interesting. there are four types of equippable items: weapon, class skill, armor and ring. there are five tiers of class skills and rings, and 10+ tiers of armors and weapons.-there are several different classes with different skills and stats for different playstyles, which makes the game much more interesting. at first most of the classes are locked, but they can be unlocked by playing and performing well with the earlier classes.the game is completely free, which means a strong pay-to-win aspect. there is a tremendous spike in difficulty after reaching certain areas. after traveling deep enough to the center of the island (or teleporting to hard dungeons), the game becomes somewhat unplayable. the monsters' health and damage are high enough to end your journey in a blink.do i recommend the game? it depends on the player's expectations. if one is looking for having, fun for free, for an hour or two, then yes. if one is looking for a long, enjoyable experience, this game can not provide it. please stay away.",0

6610,"i've put many months into this game both here on steam and on the browser variant back before they had a steam option, and i won't lie. this game was (key word there *was* ) pretty decent. i enjoyed the strengths each faction posessed, how each fight was based upon the steadfast response of the generals and how quickly the soldiers (players) could react to a confrontation especially in a 3-front war zone. battles would last many hours, and you'd make a ton of money in the war mode. tanks were difficult to deal with due to the very few ways you could actually take care of it, planes could change the outcome of a war with a well-placed/timed bomb, snipers consistently moved after kills and kept enemy troops on high alert. and the two-front spawn protection (spawning on the point or if it was being taken you spawn around the outer edges, all of which with an invisibility protection until your first shot/20 feet movement.) helped keep the battles continuous and fairly balanced even in a tough situation when outnumbered or people attempting to spawn trap instead of capping the point...but then came the plague that is reto as they do with every patch in the name of fun. originally all three factions were to get their own anti tank rifles, this was a highlight for me! i love the idea of having a fair shot as a soldier to fight armor if you're smart about where you put your shots... well.. that was 2 years ago or just about at this point. the only faction of those 3 to get an at rifle is the russians with ptrd's. things then began to steadily become more... aggrivatingly skewed, from fixing lmg's to have severe conical spread almost right out of the barrel, to their recent changes that force players to purchase generals instead of career changing to them [unless that's just a bug but i'm not entirely sure of that]... the long version the war [generals] tab gives the losing factions an underdog bonsus... or well, it's supposed to. in the past few months the bonus has become forever hooked to the u.s.s.r. [this most recent being a 67% bonus to their faction even when they were in first place for the last several days.]sure, perhaps it's just a glitch in the scripting i'll accept that. it's just a buffer afterall, don't get much out of war except better income for your efforts... but then come the more notable skews.the most notorious being the yak-9's. unload multiple clips of an aa gun or p38 / bf 109 into it, it remains alive. yet get shot by it as a p-38 or bf-109, and you're chopped down in seconds, and its bombs reach several meters further than either of the other two planes (by almost 30 feet).the second being the simple fact that the russian playerbase are rather arrogant and extensively hate-based against anyone who doesn't use the russian faction, and will enter others' factions just to hate on them. this ends up causing a domino effect which gets the butt-hurt individuals in the other factions to start going around doing the same, which ends up being a giant rage-fest instead of gaming.third one being the skew in at methods... while this has recently been fixed (i use the term loosely) by giving the u.s sticky-grenades and (much later) the lawn-dart grenades for the germans, the u.s.s.r have rpg grenades, once again having had them far longer than any other faction and giving them extensive bonuses due to the fact that they can break through near triple the amount of armor compared to the others. (3 stickies to kill a light tank, 2 rpg-43's to kill a medium... 4 lawn darts to kill a light. lawn darts being far more expensive than the other two.)paratroopers primarily based on the u.s get a carbine, which wouldn't be extensively agitating if it wasn't for the fact it can get so ridiculously powerful and accurate at range that it puts the k98, mosin and m1903 to shame. [and fyi, reto... bowl shaped parachutes were not controllable in ww2. having someone able to avoid quad-50 cal aa gun fire just by spazzing a and d rapidly is stupidly aggrivating, especially when 6 paratroopers are dropping on one point and can land on the *same roof* when dropping from almost 600+ meters seperation on dropping from the plane.]then comes the most recent rage. the pontoon-vehicle introduction. getting those vehicles was awesome. don't get me wrong. but to suddenly have russia with the *only* water-capable tank, and the *only* water-capable jeep that can use an mg mount on it, is far from showing a desire for fun in the game as you so callously flaunt at our faces. germans and u.s forces were known to use snorkels on their tanks for a reason.the most disgusting thing they've done though, is the spawn change. now you end up being spawn trapped by paratroopers and tanks more than you do getting shot by actual combatants. not only this, but if you lose the point while you're fighting *they take your gun away* because you're suddenly in an enemy spawn zone! this leaves you completely incapable of guarding yourself while you try to get away! giving them a free kill! on top of this, due to the spawns being pre-determined in 2-3 locations *per mark* you will not be able to avoid spawn killers. the moment you're spotted, you're screwed. also, when you end up being at your last point, you end up getting spawned several hundred yards away! so if you're the only one left defending (which happens alot) you end up running over there just to realize you're too late.in recent updates their camera has been freaking out extensively, primarily when prone on a hill or small incline/descent. this leads to your character looking like it's jerking off extensively, especially when you're trying to aim, which ends with death to you due to being unable to even fire unless you stand or crouch.tldr for those who can't read a player's rant aka the short version...: 1) underdog bonus is bugged to the russian's benefit and has been for several months... could just be a bug, doubt it though.2) russian players are irritating rats who don't like to lose and will enter others' factions just to rage at them in the war chats [which leads to flame wars in the chats in various languages on all 3 factions and in support chat]3) at weaponry is extensively out-performed where it actually counts. russians seem to be in the lead as far as damage capability.)4) paratroopers, especially u.s, are extensively abused to spawn kill using their m2 carbines since they only use 5 equip slots.5) water-capable vehicles are awesome! russia having the only water-capable tank and jeep able to carry a gun? not so much6) spawn change sucks balls, and has destroyed the ability of defending troops to actually do much on the matter.7) laying/going prone on a hill is a bad idea. your camera spazzes out, and they refuse to listen when you send in a ticket about these issues. even when given video evidence of it happening on anything less than flat ground. (recent patch has fixed this issue.)final outcomegame: 5/5developers: -2/5you want a game to pass the time, this'll work. everything is acquirable free of charge, even premium time! it's just a very long grind. but be warned you will rage at some point for one reason or another. don't play war without a squad of at least 3 people. and don't expect a team to work as a team.their help desk, ticket support and reporting system are crap as well. don't expect help when you need it, and don't expect much to happen when someone starts flipping off in the support channel/faction chats/global chats and so forth. at least they fixed the player search function next to the chat to actually see all the players in the chat, albeit it resets your search when someone new enters, which makes it just as worthless as it was. so don't expect to be able to block/ignore them unless you see them in-game.update 11/27/2017: no differences. still broken bias.",0

16602,"this game is shallow and un balanced. the first hour of play seems fine, you get some easy wins against players who have no idea how to play the game. then the balance changes, and you only face people who have paid to unlock all towers. the worst part about this aspect is that when you pay to unlock these towers you completely bypass the level system. so two players can both be '100 darts', and one player can have simply paid for every lvl 3 and 4 tower. so basically, at a certain point, its impossible to win without paying for the towers. so a first time player has to look forward to getting pulled into the experience, and then losing every single match bar none, for 30 matches in a row. this game is a shallow pay to win failure. i have 100% completed bloonstd 4 and 5, and i cannot stand this game. this game only exists for micro-transactions. the game itself is a hollow shell to make you pretend you're actually accomplishing something against other players, when in reality, this is a cesspool of kids with their parents credit cards, effortlessly winning against free players. pay to win, or stop playing, that is the best summary of 'bloons battles' i can give.",0

10569,"i put more hours into this than i expected, really. i was originally looking for something to scratch my mtg itch while waiting to see if i got a beta key for arena, but, after playing this, i really couldn't care less to get one. my only real gripe with the game is that some of the art is rather... displeasing to my tastes, while also addressing that this is an early access card game. there's going to be balancing issues. there's going to be shifts. that's expected; however, what is here is a joy to play. got it both on pc and tablet and i can say that it has become one of my favorite digital card games in almost no time. as for the redshell debacle, i think i came into this after that, so i cannot say anything on the matter.i will update this review as time goes by, but, so far, i recommend it. (though i am just a filthy casual: gauntlet, forge, casual, and draft for life).edit 1: after three weeks, i managed to unlock the first campaign, jekk's bounty, with only gold you earn in-game. 20,000. if i had to estimate the amount of time i truly played, between pc and tablet, i would say about 30 hours. that's about... 666 gold an hour... i did not expect that number, but... yeah! the other campaigns currently out are 25,000 apiece, so it's roughly 35-to-40 hours to unlock campaigns --or $30, if you prefer to pay. in all truth, that's still good value. i have about 43% of the original card stock unlocked through simply chests, and about 10% of the special packs each, with the exception being fall of argenport at 28%.edit 2: i finally received a closed beta code for mtga... i knew i made the right call. this game feels far better to play. let's break down my first, oh, thirty games out of mtga's tutorial. first game, used the green deck, i swore my opponent was a bot with how bad they played. second game, same issue... third game, whiplash. i was obviously not on the same level with the guy, and i got creamed. fourth-tenth game, lost due to manaflood. 11 card draws in a row, all lands. twelth game, guy quit after calling seven mulligans, having nothing in his hand. thirteenth-through-seventeenth, actually good games. fair. balanced. i lost fifteen and sixteen, but they were fun. eigtheen-through-twenty-five were jobs. opposite problem this time; i only had two lands the entire time. twenty-six through twenty-eight swapped to the black deck, got nothing but high-priced cards, and twenty-nine and thirty i played blue and once more faced people way out of my skill level.let's break all that down, shall we? 1) matchmaking is hilariously bad. sure, it's quick. none of them went above 15 seconds, but they were laughably one-sided for most of them. 2) deck randomization/shuffling is not working as intended, unless it is to inspire hatred. 3) it was boring. the ui layout is pretty, but when you have to look at it for easily fifteen minutes a match, waiting as someone agonizingly waits out timers to play the most simple of spells, it grows old fast.overall, i much prefer eternal over mtga. just... eternal may have its issues, but, after dealing with that, i am coming back with a smile on my face. i mean, i never left, but... i don't know where i was going with that. and to clarify: i don't hate mtga. it's fine for what it is, and it has the capacity to get better.edit 3: twitch prime! lots of goodies... this is going to be a critiquing post.one, i have to agree, standard decks are a touch too big. i believe 75 is just a tad too large. on top of that, it demanding exactly 1/3 of it being land is a touch annoying. note that i am not saying you should run below it, but there are some strategies where having, say, two or four less lands does work into its favor. also note you can have more than a 1/3 lands, as well.two, time-justice combo is overpowered. period. just like green in mtg, it runs rampant. the fact certain combos haven't been nerfed while tribal's levitate was speaks volumes...three, the mobile app has become a nightmare to play... there's not much else i can say about that. it feels like it takes forever updating or something in the code has been changed enough for it to run like crap on my tablet and phone. computer one still runs perfectly fine.really, these are minor gripes. i'm closing on the 45-hour mark on pc, and, got to say, still want to keep playing. that's an achievement in of itself.edit 4: dwd making me working overtime. :) they did nerf the combo.edit 5: to sum up all the negative reviews in one, tidy package-rng is bad so it is bad. translation: i don't know how to build a deck or rework it so i can do better and instantly blame everyone but myself.tutorial too long. they already said they are working on it.mana system is bad and wouldn't be because [insert popular game here]! the irony in these people is palpable, esp. those saying the creator would have done something different. probably, but hindsight is 20/20. get. over. it.hearthstone rip-off. in terms of... oh. right. they just say it. if its for the ui... wow. a good ui that others try to replicate while adding their own take on it? say it ain't so... artstyle? different enough. gameplay? more like magic-lite.certain cards are op and imbalanced. welcome to card games. also, those that usually say this also add the first two, which, again, the irony because they blame everything but themselves for failing.this should wrap up what most people say to get approved. if you are these kinds of people, i feel so sorry for you... oh, and red shell, but, as the initial review has stated, cannot speak on that.edit 6: since this has become a thoughtpiece on my opinion of mtg arena as well as eternal, i guess i'll post what i think of it after it came to open b-don't. even. bother.they learned nothing in the transition. matchmaking is still crap. deck shuffling algorithm is still crap, and this is me making my mono-green ramp carnage tyrant-vine mare-blanchwood combo again with 97% winrate. only boros at the moment comes close, and they are all the same cookie-cutter . on top of that, they cut rewards for winning games, making grinding an obscene chore while, also, allowing paid players to keep their currency --which is fine if the matchmaking was good.in every aspect, eternal has shown to be the more rewarding game. the more fun game. sure, it can have its stagnant meta decks, but more oft than not i ran into people doing something different. something that went against the mundanity of the meta.edit 7: wotc listened to the community for mtg:a... it feels like they planned it the entire time and were using it for good press. until they actually listen and follow up on what is being said, since closed mind, i'm not changing my stance on it.that being said, [in eternal] i joined the new league... i had terrible luck with the packs, but i still find it fun to watch. another point to this game: it pushed me to try the non-casual scene, and i enjoyed it. plus, that card back is sexy.",1

11503,"i have played almost every single major online fps that has been released in the last 20 years and the hours i have put into this game are enough for me to know that it is absolutely one of the best i have played. for me it is a perfect mix of counter strike and call of duty (apart from the fact it uses counter strikes moving while firing mechanics - there is absolutely no jumpshotting or firing snipers while moving in this game, and its best to stay pretty still in general which i hate in video games, but each to their own).mechanically this game is sound, i like the map designs and i like the objectives (tdm, cs type objectives, and a domination type mode where each team has to protect their 5 bases from being destroyed by enemy gunfire, explosives, and usually, knives). i like the weapons and i've never seen a game where preference is so subjective. in call of duty i did tend to stick to certain guns but hand me any ar and it'll do the same job as any other. this game has wildly different guns so it's fun to experience different ones and find out what works for you, you don't really want to google best guns as each person will definitely have different tastes. these are the bulk of the microtransactions, but it's a really solid f2p experience and absolutely not p2w at all. i got the most powerful sniper in the game on my first day without making a purchase and bought an ak47 and a few other guns within a few hours of gameplay, and have also accrued a few loaned guns which expire after a few days of redeeming them (you can store them in your inbox for 30 days before redeeming), but i might not even use them as guns are obtained very reasonably. netcode is absolutely incredible and i haven't ever felt like i should have got that hit/kill unless it was down to my own failures, absolutely top marks in that regard.my one huge gripe with this game, however, is down to the community. people never ever communicate but on the off chance they do it's probably to call someone the n word (although i haven't played the hostage/snd game modes too much). unfortunately i'm not exaggerating at all, in my hours of gameplay so far, not a single player has taken my advice from enemy locations or objective instructions. players mostly use knives on objectives so they are absolutely sitting ducks ripe for the picking, but no one will ever go and get that easy kill if you tell them there is an enemy knifing an objective. ever.i have not seen a single positive thing come from the community except the occasional gl hf which is usually followed by a go f_ your mom n_ f_ or something along those lines. you need to play with friends if you want any chance of your teammates being responsive, especially as this game is full of f2p noobs.that being said, if you have a good group of friends to play with, you'll probably stomp every single game and never actually lose.amazing game, let down slightly by an atrocious community. if you're american it might not be so bad as it may just be the language barrier of european servers as well as the type of people that play f2p games here.",1

1963,"there are alot to say about dota (defenders of the ancients).it's a remake of the old dota mod for warcraft.actually i could say that the transition from dota->dota 2 gameplay was amazing,they didn't forgot a single thing and added even more than original dota.the game got amazingly cool graphics and a great soundtrack.the menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players.valve really cares about your learning in dota2 so they've made a learning page where they teach you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items (dota 2 have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each hero),because dota 1 didn't had that option,so you need to now by your experience what to buy.they have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does.if you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more professional player to teach you (it's called coach),he will spectate your game and make you tips.the gameplay is amazing,i love it because it's very realistic and logic (dota 2 got a lot of logic,instead mobas like lol don't have).the art of heroes are sorry but i'll repeat it,are amazing,everything is amazing in dota (almost) xdstill dota got some problems that need to be corrected:1st-the community.dota 2 community is full of stupid noobish kids,who don't know how to play and don't even learn how to play,and when you say them don't feed or other item,they'll always say to you fuc...you,noob,i've fuc.. your mother...(typical answer of russian 12 y.o kids).2-some updates that don't needed to be done (like removing the pudge fountain hook,because it had a lot of logic...and they removed it).but nevermind to this.3-i can't tell you if dota2 still got many bugs or not,but i notice that they still have a few,like shop bug where you can't buy items.4-servers.i don't know why but it's normal to have the servers down in dota2,and sometimes in the game will appear searching for dota2 network,don't know why this happens but probably their servers can't hold so much people?(my opinion).so yeah thats pretty what i've wrote.i hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do.good luck & have fun :)",1

13999,"the game is free. expect bugs, a way for the devs to make money, and people and situations that willyou off. i've only played for a few hours but the game is good as it is. there's an open world mode and battle royal, so you can choose to have a more dedicated play experience or just constant br. things the game lacks- the game is in dire need of some actual vehicle gameplay. i think you can buy like 3 in the open world mode but even then i feel like the price isnt worth it and the vehicles probably arent the strongest, (idk though).attachments for weapons, ive seen a few attachments laying around on the open world mode but never in br. i feel like it would be better if less pistols spawned on the ground and maybe attachments or other things the game lacks.in short this game would be the perfect f2p openworld/br zombie game if it had - a new map maybe, upgraded textures or annimations, and sounds the sounds arent smooth and zombie vocals cut in and out over other zombies, attachments for weapons, pistols spawn out thein small areas. you might walk in to a building and find 8 pistols yet not be able to find any in other areas.this review wasn't too well thought out i justa wanted to share how i feel about the game in its current state.",1

2272,"let me go ahead and say this, before you consider playing this game, if you aren't willing to sink time in learning the game through external means, you probably won't enjoy this game. it's very complex, and while some might be able to figure everything out themselves, most won't. now, onto my review.path of exile is an arpg, and a spiritual successor to diablo 2. in my own opinion, it takes everything diablo 2 did well, and improved upon it in many way. now this is not to say this game is perfect, there are flaw with it, as with every game, but we'll get to that later on.pros:1. very indepth: this game will never let you feel as though you know everything, there is so much to learn, that even with over 500 hours sunk into this game, always reading up on this game and watching videos, i'm still learning, for me, this is great. i don't like to feel like i've mastered a game within 10 hours of playing. some might disagree with me here, but i'm listing this as a pro.2. the community: the community in path of exile is one of the most friendly i've ever seen in a game at this scale. sure, you get one every so often, but for the most part, everyone is very friendly. on top of that, player interaction is very frequent, with there not being an in-game auction house, players will use 3rd party website to see offers others make and message them to purchase it, rather than it just being a disconnect from others.3. the longevity & replay value: i feel like this game has a long time before closing, and there is so much replay value it's almost too much. the early levels do feel very boring, but that shouldn't be too much of an issue as most of the game is played at the end-game content. now, even with early levels feeling boring, once you get past ~30, it picks up a bit and becomes more enjoyable, so it's not entirely bad. overall, i would say the replay value is high and longevity insurmountable.4. build diversity: whenever i tell my friends about this game, i always tell them to find a build. however, this can be a little challenging, as there's so many options to choose from. almost every build has it's own flair, it's own feel, and it's own strengths in certain situations. the best way i can describe this, is that there is a skill that will burn yourself for 90% of your maximum hp per second, and deal 50% of your maximum hp persecond to nearby enemies. it feels as though there's never a lack of builds for you to try, and that's very important for a game like this.cons:1. new-player-un-friendly: this game seems like it's trying to be as hostile as possible to those who are trying this game for the first time, the passive skill tree can be overwheling, and the way skills work and be confusing. this can be overcome by just spending time learning about the game from outside sources, though.2. early leveling: early leveling feels like a choir. it's very boring and stale. it gets better as you level, but only really picks up once you've accquired the skill you want to use and some supports for it.overall:overall, path of exile is an incredible game with some early game flaws. i highly recommend playing path of exile, i've spent 500 hours on it so far, and i don't plan on stopping any time soon.",1

17435,"note: this is an updated review. i had taken down my previous not recommended one a while back. i have such a severe love/hate relationship with this game, but this one will remain.i have been with this franchise since 1999. hours played on here is so far off due to playing for so many years off of steam. with my love of the franchise, you won't get a biased review here. in fact, i don't even always know why i recommend this game. and yes, i know how commentors work, if i have this many hours in a game, how can it not be recommended? quite frankly because this is not the same game i used to play all those hours. this is an mmo, and mmos change. but, i recommend this game, to an extent.the beginning and first few expansions are great. but then, i think there is only 1 word to describe how the game becomes: bloated. they seem to add more features for advancement, than actual content. sometimes it feels as if they are trying to give the illusion that there is more content than their really is. kunark ascending tried doing that with the epic 2.0 weapons. you will be doing more in older content, than current content, to gain that weapon. and i am talking content that is much lower than you. i don't mind working for a weapon that is the best in slot for 2-ish years, but their wasn't much in the way of new content to do.i know i don't speak for everyone, but i feel this is a game that only gets worse if you rush it. there are over 8,000 quests in this game, but expansions only add in the double digits these days. if you are a quester, if you want to adventure, i can only recommend this game if you don't rush, because once you get to the end game, you will see many illusions of content.so why recommend this game? the content that is there, is fairly good. it sucks that it ends so quickly at end game, but the grind will at least be real if you want that. but i mainly recommend the start and the first few expansions. after that, it just gets bloated. but some people do enjoy that.this is just my 2 cents, i don't expect everyone to agree with me. but you can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours out of this game on 1 character, and not be able to do everything, unless you rush and only focus on the last couple expansions. but, grinders can get those hours. i am just speaking of unique content. not repeats.",1

3597,"hat simulator 2: hat harder, what can i say about it that hasn't been said already? it's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. but, you've heard that a thousand times. what of the meat and bones? the mechanics that everything is built on? gotta say, hella good. the interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. like, what if i ran a melee medic? or a melee heavy? what could make this more fun to play? it is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. plus who could argue with the price? now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then i would have no complaints.",1

12010,"if this mmo had been released in 2008, it would of been a below average mmo of its day, in 2018, it is a very poor addition to the genre. they have designed a game without any forward thinking, or even what works with classic mmos.having some great features that work in other games may help, but forgetting to include ancillary systems leaves them dead in the water. it is hard to believe how bad this game is, with so much money invested into it and how long it spent in development hell. the engine is so dated and is not at all optimised, so much so, that even with this game, with graphics that look like something from about 12 years ago or more, after setting everything to minimum (1), it still stutters and drops frames, showing how little love or care was put into this game. compare this to bdo for graphical fidelity and performance, the difference is night and day.leaving that, and the game place, spending the first 10 mins in a game like this and you will start to know if you will hate it or at least like it a little, this game was unintuitive. play any game from warhammer online, wow, etc. and you will straight away be able to jump in and start messing about, but with this it is clunky.i could go on about some of the other systems that they have in place, but, i think you get the picture, i was looking forward to some fun but i found none here, i would advise others to look elsewhere too.",0

29323,"this is a strategy which once failed for my parents one christmas eve.i was given a slot car racer track, and because we were driving to the other grandparents house on christmas day, i was told i could stay up until i crashed. the other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. when you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.when i went to college i studied electrical engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.for the rest of the evening my father tried in vain to knock me from the track. he used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant i could cause his plans to backfire. i'm sure it was only a few minutes that i held on, but to a kid my age it was practically all night.",0

4289,"the single worst yu-gi-oh game i have ever played.the single worst card game i have ever played.i've already written a review of this elsewhere and one of much larger length and in much more detail so let me just make bullet points.1. this game uses a large amount of mechanics that seem like they've been ripped out of hearthstone and given then a thin appearance change. card converting, hero powers and the exact way they do the small things like emotes are all too similar to their competitor to be ignored, it's to the point where it's much more likely that they straight up stole them from a better game.2. the rarity system in this game is the most broken thing i have ever seen with cards such as black skull dragon being rated as less rare than cards like magician of black chaos despite being more powerful in every possible way and being arguably more iconic. if that's not too far for you sonic bird, a monster with less than half the stats of both black skull dragon and magician of black chaos, a common in the real game and with an effect which allows you to search your deck for a ritual spell card. is one of the rarest cards in the game thus by the games logic making it more valuable than cards like battleguard king (which has 3000 attack and can attack upto 3 times) and black skull dragon. now in turn if you're thinking that's because it helps you summon out stronger monsters... you'd be wrong, with all the ritual monsters currently in the game there is only 1 more powerful than battleguard king in effect and more powerful than black skull dragon in attack. this card happens to be an event card so there's no chance of getting it anytime soon.and this is not an isolated case as many low level creatures with semi interesting effects are considered ultra rares in the eyes of this game. there's a monster called gaia soul, the combustable collective which has 2000 atk/0 def and the ability to deal damage to your oppenant by attack defense position monsters as if they were attack position.if the game were a good game this would earn its rarity as super rare however given that it isn't the ai doesn't use defense position monsters, the duels are decided in 2 turns in pvp so nobody will use defense position monsters there either and dark blade (1800 atk/ 1500 def) is a common, meaning alongside the fact that after levelling joey to 5 or so and gaining the ability to give warrior monsters + 200 atk chances are you've made this super rare completely and utterly irelevant with a common.3. they lie about the era they're in.whenever i made the previous review i received feedback stating that there were no synchro monsters because they were only in the gx era, because synchro monsters didn't exist then they wouldn't have access to them and they'll be coming in time. this is entirely wrong, they claim they're in the gx era but they have access to six samurai which are legendary for the use of not only synchro monsters but also xyz monsters. they have mecha phantom beasts, they have the blue-eyes archetype and they have an insane amount of other archetypes which are rendered incomplete because they don't have their boss monsters who are synchro or xyz. they even have ghostrick as a level up bonus for levelling up bonz. 4. if you start of the game as kaiba you'll notice that kaiba is a borderline psychopath who loves nothing more than beating on kids, and posing over their defeated remains jojo style. for god sake the most common thing for him to do upon winning a duel is cackle like a madman, they did not do a good job at representing kaiba.5. pvp in this game is impossible, and i don't mean like the pvp community are advanced or anything but rather the servers are horrible. they cannot keep you in a game for more than four turns, they will disconnect you. i have played ranked a total of nine or ten times and out of those nine or ten times six or seven of them ended whenever the servers disconnected me. for reference at the time of this happening my internet speed was 5.7 mbps. not great but simultaniously not horrible. i could play an mmo or just about any game online with this speed if they're optimised properly, but apparently this yu-gi-oh! mobile game cannot keep me connected to a 2d, barely dynamic game for more than four turns.6. the lag is horrible!there is a timer in the game for duels, it gives you around 170 seconds for each turn and if it reaches zero you lose the game. now already that's pretty horrible game design, it should at least give you a chance since anything could have happened but here's the kicker to the whole thing. ranked lags so much that the visuals for the timer slow down whils the timer itself does not, it has been a real problem for me that my move has taken more than 170 seconds to make, and i'll tell you the exact move now.draw>play monster>equip spell>attack>end turn.now anyone who has played yugioh in the real world knows this takes maybe 10 seconds to do including response of opposition and thought time. in most yu-gi-oh! games it will take a little longer, maybe 18 seconds. in games like duel network or online yu-gi-oh! games it generally takes less time because your opponent doesn't need to respond and it's on an automated system so lets say 9 seconds for that.without lag this game takes 30 seconds to make that move, because for some reason it feels the need to pause on every card like it's a god card, with lag it can take 170 seconds+ even whenever the game is functioning perfectly it's a slow, boring process.7. the game simply isn't fun. everything you do in the game is designed to be a grind, and the amount of lag and time it takes to play a single duel takes away any enjoyment of the game itself. ranked is broken and there are characters which are impossible for kaiba to unlock because they specify yami yugi as a condition to unlocking them, the game feels entirely designed for yugi players, like there was no effort put into kaiba whatsoever, and they even get the cards characters use wrong. the joey starter deck is gearfried the legend, and battleguard king. the yugi starter deck is trance the magic swordsmanthe jaden starter deck is elemental hero blazeman and finally the kaiba deck is felgrand dragonall the starter decks are in the right ball park but simultaniously cards never used by the characters, it would have been much better for to instead be.joey starter deck: a fusion-based deck focusing around thousand dragon.jaden starter deck: a deck which focuses around the use of kuriboh.yugi starter deck: a deck focusing around queen, king and jacks knightkaiba starter deck: as a gimick compared to the others have the kaiba deck be that deck he used against his own one whenever he was training.8. the pack naming convention is messed up. with the earlier packs they would name them after the boss monster of the pack. the one with blue-eyes ultimate dragon being named the ultimate rising and the one with tyrant dragon being named tyrant's flame however later on they switch this to more vague names like what you find in the real game. names like electric overdrive for a pack which includes machien fusions.9. there are some cards that are impossible to tell how to get. just starting out there were two decks i wanted to make. one was a dragon deck and i ended up with a spirit ryu otk deck for that, but the other deck i wanted to make was a water deck however ocean dragon lord neo-daedalus is one of those cards. it's definately in the game but i have no clue how to get it, there are no directions and levia-dragon daedalus is good but it's not a boss monster.i have been playing yugioh since release, and i had been coming off of it. i had stopped playing yugioh and i decided to give it one last chance with this game. this game was the worst experience in gaming i have ever had, my original ranking for it was 1/10 because it's not even functional.",0

13718,"first off, let's not beat around the bush here. creativerse can easily be mistaken for just another minecraft clone. just taking a single glance at this game can give it that impression. and i can understand that first-glance impression to a certain degree. if you are expecting a game that is radically different from minecraft, you are quite frankly looking in the wrong place.that said though, i enjoy creativerse quite a bit more than i enjoy minecraft. the thing with creativerse is that it aims to be a bigger and better minecraft, and i personally think that they are doing pretty good at that for now. there are enough differences and improvements between the two games that i can say creativerse is well worth a try if you have either played minecraft already or if you just couldn't bring yourself to play minecraft but wanted a similar(/better) game. first off, i honestly believe creativerse is clearer and easier to get into than minecraft is. if only just for the reason that in creativerse you can see what you can craft and that there are blueprints available that let you know what you need to craft it in the first place. minecraft just throws you in the deep end and just says 'i dunno, you go figure it out' without any notion of a hint or general direction. and while creativerse does something similair, it at least does so with a better ui and a little bit of help.secondly are the much better graphics. minecraft is notorious for just being a bunch of badly textured blocks. creativerse is still designed around blocks as well, but at least in creativerse they look much nicer and better designed. the biggest con i can think of, and one i think needs to be mentioned, is that this game is entirely focused on being online. if the servers (or your internet connection) decide to go awol, then that's it, no more creativerse for you until the connection is restored.",1

3678,"tf2: a game being hurt by its developerswhen you accumulate 2,700+ hours (at the time of writing this review, also i have no life :c ) in a game, i feel like a review is warranted. for a game that has lasted over 7+ years and still has a solid player base of around 50,000 players online at any given time, there has to be something special about team fortress 2, and there is. personally, i believe it's the versatility valve has created for the game. players aren't limited to the vanilla tf2 that the developers originally created. there are many of third party servers filled with custom game modes made by the community such as versus saxton hale, jailbreak, and much more that have kept the game alive. it is the tf2 community's desire to expand on the what valve laid the foundation for that has made the game as popular as it is today. when you get bored of regular tf2 that revolves around nine playable classes that duke it out to the death, there is so much more to play that keeps the game fresh.the core gameplay is also very enjoyable. with each of the nine classes bringing a unique mechanic to the table, ranging from projectile weapons to hit-scan weapons, there is a class that will speak to almost everyone. to supplement this, there are multiple game modes to play on such as payload, control point, attack/defend, king of the hill, and much more. each one provides a fun experience that will keep you playing hours on end. the game revolves a lot around teamwork and coordination but has room for individuals to make big plays. tf2 brings special aspect to a first-person shooter that hasn't been found in many other fps and makes it stand out. now on to the more critical point(s) of the review:1) the implementation of competitive:in recent times, i feel like the developers of tf2 are really beginning to destroy the game. when you play the game for 1000+ hours, you begin to notice things that are starting to hinder the game. one the main issues that i have is the direction of how competitive valve wants the game to be. what i mean by this is whether the game should be a competitive type of game like csgo or a casual game which tf2 has been for years. as of now, it has been confusing, especially with the recent meet your match update. originally, the game was purely a casual type of game. friendly heavies everywhere, random critical hits, players comparing hats, and players from both blue and red teams conga-ing in harmony. overall, it was a very laid back game. while there has been always a competitive side birthed by the tf2 community since its release, valve hasn't really acknowledged them until around the time period of this review. and that is sort of the problem. only now is valve beginning to make the game competitive. that isn't bad or anything, but the issue is that their attempt to create a competitive tf2 scene seems half my main example: competitive mode in its beta form is almost no different than its so called final form or the form on its release. there are so many issues that plagued this mode that were brought up by the community while it was in beta. many of them still exist today that deter from the competitive experience such as the current competitive ranking system. i've played in a few third party competitive tf2 sites and compared to them, the tf2 version of matchmaking feels like a still-developing game mode that is competitive only in name. 2) the transition from a casual to a competitive game:another problem that is hurting the game is valve's sloppy transition from casual to competitive. what used to be known as quick play, now has been transformed into a shell of its former self in casual mode. the simplicity of casual tf2 has been destroyed with the frustrating features/lack of features. one of my main (maybe petty) annoyances is the system in which players now join servers in casual mode. as it is now, the max amount of people you can have in a party is six. for the numerous valve servers that can sport up to 12 players per team, it is very upsetting that valve prevents players from having parties up to the max players per team. not only that, while before you could join a friend's game in progress manually, valve has prevented that making only so you can join random games through the casual mode matchmaking system. this does have its perks though. for one, kicking the ever so increasing number of hackers has become easier (well if the vote passes). 3) conclusion:don't get me wrong, tf2 is a fun game. but in conclusion, with the recent updates, valve seems to be on the line on making tf2 fully competitive. why? while the ui of the game may seem competitive, the core gameplay isn't. valve is trying to make tf2 something the core gameplay isn't matching which is competitive and it makes the game not flow together well. having random critical hits in a competitive styled casual mode is a small sign of evidence of that. along with this most of the interface is sloppily made and not user friendly as it could be. if you just want to play tf2 for fun, i think it's a hard time to be a tf2 player without encountering frustration at every end with valve. overall, i would give it a 6/10 as it is now.tldr for new players: i can't ensure that you will enjoy tf2 in the current state it is in. if you're a new player, i feel like it would be hard to enjoy tf2 to the fullest and would not recommend unless you're willing to brave the frustration or valve fixes the game.tdlr for older players: not much has really changed in the core mechanics of the game. if you're looking to get back into tf2 and played mostly in valve servers, be prepared for the chance to become annoyed with the features/lack of. the community servers remained mostly the same with the only difference being that they gained a section dedicated solely for them.",1

12620,"product received for freeso i know raceroom is going to stay at a mixed rating for basically its entire lifespan on the steam store, but figured i'd throw a review out there for people actually interested. to start off, there is a paywall, one that seems endless. for a while, i viewed raceroom as a good intro into racing sims (free entry), while the other sims (assetto, project cars 2, and so on) were better long-term investments. recently, i thought that over once more, and given the optional costs in just about every sim out there, raceroom isn't far from the competition. each game has dlc, usually alot of dlc, which leaves you to chose what is worth driving vs. the cost. raceroom does this, but at least gives you a start in a few different directions (for free). this is probably the most overlooked aspect. you aren't given a free aaa simulator, but rather a decent taste of what is to come. do you like hillclimb or circuit racing? prototypes, modified racecars, or just slightly upgraded road vehicles? to be honest, that roster can be easily expanded beyond that with weekly events (more free cars/tracks to test out). to address another issue people often are skeptical of, the cars/maps are amazing (especially the free ones). i really like hillclimb, but the roster of tracks and cars i actually like are somewhat limited (in general, not within raceroom). somehow, raceroom managed to give away what would be either my or car, along with my map for free. just google georg plasa bmw 134, you can hear that sound all day long once you download raceroom. i guess to build off from that, i'll move onto something that isn't an issue (quite the opposite), the sound. if i want good audio, i'll use assetto, but if i want great audio, dirt rally, if i want the best audio in a sim, raceroom. don't get me wrong, assetto has some great sounding vehicles (especially when mods are brought into play), but go into replay mode sometime. just pick a point on a medium sized map, and sit there, listing for the cars. there will most likely be some silence, then all of a sudden, some buzzing sound pops up. that buzz slowly turns into an actual engine sound, which passes, turns into a buzz, then silence. dirt rally has some of the best sounding cars in general, although you can't get far enough from the vehicle to listen to the approach. raceroom, on the other hand, manages to capture the ambiance of basically being there (wherever there is). the audio of the car doesn't just cut in, and it never sounds computer generated. after a nice hillclimb run, i can set the camera up to a spectator view, and wait. eventually, once the car is within a mile or so range, you'll begin hearing the faded sound of the engine in the distance. the sound will build up as the vehicle approaches, the occasional backfire in the distance. then it quickly picks up, and then a blur as the vehicle passes. the sound swapping from hearing the echoes of the exhaust to now having the exhaust aiming directly at you. after 5 or so seconds, the car is out of sight, but you can still hear it, you can most definitely hear it. (i really like the sound design...) well, i'm this far into it, i might as well do a complete review. part of what makes the replays stick out as being immersive is the graphics. despite what some reviewers have said, this game has some beautiful scenery. along with the great graphics, are also great optimizations. somehow the team behind raceroom managed to get 2d sprites to look 3d. in driving, you'd basically never expect every tree you pass to be a flat 2d (maybe 2d crossed by another 2d sprite) image, but they are (from what i saw). even in replays, they are blended together so well, you'd really have to focus in on them to realize they are 2d. i took a screenshot recently, did slight light adjustments, put on a black and white filter, added in some film grain, and in print, it matches up with what i'd expect a film camera to produce (not a perfect lens, as motion blur added some blur around the outside corners). lastly, this is an unforgiving sim (similar to assetto corsa). trying to race with a keyboard isn't to go so well. even with a controller, i'd wish best of luck to you. that said, just like every other sim, it is highly rewarding to finally understand what will cause a car to do what. with all of that said, i do recommend anyone interested in sim racing to give raceroom a go. use this to figure out if realism is something you want in a racing game, without worrying about a 2 hour refund period.",1

4781,"please note, my hours played are highly unnaccurate. i've clocked roughly 300+ hours, prior to having a steam account.as someone whose first moba was league of legends, smite was really a breath of fresh air for me. the grapics are simply amazing, and it feels like a large step up for a moba game compared to others out there. the one thing that blew me away is just how many events and how many skins you can buy with favor, the currency you get just from playing games. skins bought with favor are basically just recolors, but it's still more than most free to play games would give you.smite brings the action right into your face, as you play from an over-the-shoulder camera angle; which actually makes you have to aim your auto attacks, something mostly unheard of in a moba before smite came around. there's so many modes to choose from, and if you pick up the god pack (preferrably on sale) you get every god/ess they release, forever. it feels like smite just brings so much more to the table than any moba before it.one thing that always goes overlooked when people talk about smite is the lore. the people in charge of creating and releasing new gods really do their research into mythology to make the gods abilities fit their myth or lore. as a fan of mythology when i was in high school, i find myself reading the lore and actually looking up some of the gods i've never heard of from other cultures just to read up on them, interested in how they all fit together. i've not yet found a god in smite whose ability set didn't fit their theme, in my honest opinion.my only issues with smite as it is now, is it's not very new player friendly. what i mean by this, is if you came from another moba and/or that is your main genre of gaming, you will be entirely lost on how to work your way around smite, as i was to start out. the balance is also a major issue that i've noticed compared to most other mobas. it doesn't seem as bad until you get further in and the characters you hated going against turn up in every game, fed beyond your wildest dreams and stomping all over your team. if you are a fan of the moba genre, or even just want to give it a shot and want something new in your library, i highly reccommend giving smite a try.",1

1048,"this game satisfies my desire for a fast-paced space battle with capital ships. these ships are lumbering kilometre long behemoths but a majority of the ships are actually quite agile. don't get me wrong,. when i say fast-paced, i mean specifically for capital ships and not dogfighting. a majority of space capital ship games will have you spending a minute to turn 90 while this game has you turning on a dime. the best part is, they also allow strafing.the ship models are simply amazing. they are very detailed and there is a nice variety of ships. not all of them are 100% symmetrical as well which to me is great as symmetrical ships seem to be a sci-fi trope. you can also tell a ship's purpose just by looking at them. if you see an enemy ship with a huge gun strapped to its side, you better hope you're not in its firing arc!the learning curve can be pretty intense though. you will fall into the trap of tunnel vision in your first few games and leeroy jenkins your way into an enemy team's kill zone. but the thing is you will only blame yourself, and not the game's mechanics.i'm having a blast with this game and i can't wait for what they will do next. try it out yourself. it's free!",1

4185,"i thoroughly enjoyed this game when first installed, mostly due to nostalgia and my enjoyment of tcgs. that being said, many, many cards from the series are not included. no pot of greed, no monster reborn, etc. the ai is highly unbalanced. initially, the computer opponents practically hand you victory after victory. eventually, the ai will reach such a level that only very specific decks will allow you the chance to win. the game will repeatedly mention there is no such thing as a correct deck, however, in this game, that is definitely not true. i got to a point where i won maybe 1 out of 5 games, and if you want anything for the loss, you have to stick it out through the extra five minutes of the ai making pointless moves to flaunt its power while you sit there just waiting to die so you can go on to the next losing match. you can always play against easy opponents at any time, however, you have to earn keys, since they cost keys to play. great time waster for a week or so, but then this game becomes very tedious. i will also mention that in the 124 hours logged into this game, i earned enough gems to open just shy of 300 card packs. i mention this merely so you can have an idea of how many cards i had, and so that you know i had many choices in strategy before i just decided to call it quits and uninstall.",0

4695,"smite is your counterpart to lol - a moba, behaves very similarly, has casual and competitive gamemodes, and your only difference is third-person perspective versus an angle-locked overhead scroller. either of these games are easy to pick up from a fresh start, but when trying to play one after getting comfy with the other, it's only gonna feel horrible. i managed to step into smite a bit before league, and i took this game over the other as a comfort pick. since this game is alike league, expect it to have a lot of the same elements as lol - a high mechanical and game-knowledge learning curve, skill ceilings and required knowledge of all characters (considering smite double+ of league's), item understanding and grasp of the changing meta, the list goes on. i would say from my perspective, smite came off as a lot less intimidating witht the amount of knowledge required over league, but i'm sure that can be argued either way,smite's a good game, and it can be good fun. always the kind of game to be more fun with friends, and third person makes things a lot more demanding for mechanical control, rather than where can you click a million times with your mouse and hope the game/client responds in time and accurately. it has a strong casual scene, and a competitive scene, with some very likeable figures to represent the game (no, i'm not talking about dmbrandon).however, i have more than a few complaints, after nearly 2k hours on pc and around 700 on console:- just because it's a smaller community, doesn't mean that toxic people don't necessarily exist. they do, in less quantity, but man, smite players can be ridiculous. it only gets worse the higher up on the ranked ladder you climb.- the tutorial for smite does a poor job at teaching you practical knowledge and buying. yes, it's trying to cram a lot in within about five tutorial games, but it does a very ineffective job at that. you're taught to strictly focus towers or dive head-on into fights, buy meditation (as one of the worst actives available), and the tutorial only initiates other horrible habits for new players. be open to learn from youtubers and other players as you explore.- the game is typically broken in some way, all the time. for an example, to compliment ullr's highly anticipated and very rare tier 5 skin, they buffed him subtly into an absolute assinine state, where he received a 100% ban rate at worlds. relics are typically either functional, or bugged to where they often won't go off in time. relics not working is more of a niche complaint being that i play competitively, but having a game that is very often imbalanced, alike league, can be stressful.- ranked matchmaking is misery. i don't know much for league's ranking system, but i do know that the way smite's ranked matchmaking operates is punishing. it is intended to be a logical system, to where if you are performing very well in lower mm, it will raise your matchmaking rank/elo to try and pair you with more skillful players. it's a good system, in a sense, but retrospectively is brutal if it isn't accurate. for me to have the capability to place in platinum in a past split is nice, and even then i was being restrained by solo-queuing. a brand new season started recently, and i ran my placement games. to be consistently matched with bronze v players, or players who were new to ranked, yet be matched against platinum and diamond players (like i should be), is ridiculous. to have a placement in the middle of silver, yet i can go and compete at a diamond level, beating people who have previously placed masters in a great game, is very ridiculous. ranked is an optional experience for competitive players, and if you do decide to take this opportunity on, do not expect it to be forgiving to you in the slightest. most of the complaints are ones that league players can say the same for, as expected. but, if you can look over said issues, and grab a few friends, smite as a casual game is expansive and enjoyable.",1
3180,"this game didn't lag even once while i played it (looking at you pubg). premium doesnt give you any advantage, just clothing. character customization is way better than it actually should be (i mean you can't even see your face anyway, but kudos for the nice touch in there). different ways to move around the map and make you playstyle more...awesome i guess? you can be death from above with glider(watch the shadows peeps) , extra fast moving from one spot to another with snowboard and climbing pack gives you an edge at the beginning of the match and you can literally be the hospital with two legs (carry tonns of medpacks etc).now for the dislikes. can't shoot with smgs from snowboard and while climbing (i heard that they will change that), you can hear the steps of every1 from very far away (annoying, cant sneak around, perhaps they should make another class that is slow, without perks like glider etc but with muffled walking), on medium settings some of the graphics glitch if you look at the trees and stuff (sometimes flashes or textures move around, doesn'd bother much, but still). and last... and least annoying thing, all characters are asian (not that i dislike asians, but why limit it with only this option? you can edit your dude or dudette to look half asian, but thats about it).can't deside about the get to tha choppa escaping. i hate and like it at the same time, people never cooperate, but there is a chance that in the midst of chaos etc you can just slip through the opponents and win the match by smokebombing everything.in all other aspects, nothing surprising, if you don't count that it's free and it works more or less without flaws. be sure to give it a try!",1

11873,"bless online looks incredible at first glance, but like a new car bought off craigs list the problems quickly come into view. the engine simply doesnt work, fps drops are consistent even on a pc that can run bdo on 60 fps consistently, the ui freezes your computer consistently for small spurts for no reason, the windshields literally 5 inches from your face and trying to adjust it simply launches it into the stratosphere, and finally the game itself freezes like its going to win something. now this can be forgiven as the game is in early access and as such can easily be fixed. lack of optimization is not neccessarily a bad thing and shouldnt affect ones purchase, however with this game having been released previously it doesnt really scream good things at you while you play.bless online has some of the easiest leveling in the game, which is one of the only things i am pleasantly surprised by. most games with enchanting systems like bless have long slogs of leveling and enchanting to keep people around for years (im looking at you bdo) simply because they lack content. bless seems to have corrected this issue. it is altogether possible to hit level 30 in around 10-14 hours while running dungeons and while it is boring it isnt neccessarily difficult. the problem with this is that the game is so boring you may never want to find out what combat or pvp is present at endgame and if you are lucky enough to not crash every 30 minutes you might even get that chance.tldr: bless offline is a brilliant tool to train patience with, if you enjoy staring at a login screen for hours and crashing constantly give it a try. also i enjoyed it 10/10 would play again...after its fixed... in 2 years",0

10288,probably what is the best hunting sim on the market today. graphics are great but the animals are nothing if not predictable. very good overall game though as the animals look and usually seem to act with some realism. like that its not always a 2 minute hunt to get the trophy you were looking for. sometimes takes much longer and more effort to bag a good trophy. with the free to play (limited animals only) the game should keep a pretty large following. ive enjoyed it so far.,1

2762,"to start, i should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. when the community is good, it's great! i've formed many lasting friendships, and i'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i met through the game.but war thunder has a problem with women. not all players are like that--not even the majority. but enough s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls i know, and we as a community can do better.i'm a woman. i like to play comp, and i get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. for the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy j1 somehow gets me every push.) but there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if i'll send nudes, or if i'll perform an obscene act for you. (even if you're joking, it's really not funny, i promise.) it's grating to be continually asked if i'm a bomber main since i'm a girl, or for you to demand that i pocket you. (i don't play bomber. sorry. how about naval planes?)it's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them trolling me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and aand much, much worse. i've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. when playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.and despite all this, i still get on mic and speak. partly because i'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. time and time again, i've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. they say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. people say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.i know most of you are decent people. i'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. but we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. more than just reporting it when you see it (although i wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. even a simple hey man, that's not cool can both (1) let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and (2) let the harassee know that decent people do exist. the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.so please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!eta: thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, i appreciate it! it means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. like i said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.a couple people have said things akin to this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc. i'm well aware of how the internet can be, and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. it's not me i'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as i am who really suffer. just because i'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.people have also said things akin to if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating. aside from putting the blame on me (which i think is unfair), i don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. it's not like i announce to everyone hey guys, this is my girlfriend! we are dating! (although i really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). what generally happens is one of us will refer to other as babe during a game (e.g., nice pilot knockout, babe), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.also, every person who responded to this post with shut up bomber just proved my point. i know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit.",0

4632,"i have never really written a review for any game on steam, but this game breaks that mold, in fact it breaks lots of molds in the moba genre in all. its a moba game that uses a third person camera at all times, while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that makes the game uninteresting in a few moments of gameplay it does not. it always keeps my attention and i waste hours playing this game without even realising it and thats the thing. whenever i try to play any other moba game (dota 2/league of legends) i get bored quickly because i feel like the action just isnt there. this game on the contrary is always filled with excitment and im always on my toes when i play this game. all of the basic attacks are whats called skill shots meaning you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game. unlike other moba games you do not click on the ground to move, instead you move with the wasd keys and you have to option to re bind them to something else. currently the game has about 69 gods to play as from different pantheons. gods are essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a champion if you will and they all look and sound great! hell the entire game looks amazing even when everything was turned down on low! the game modes vary from conquest (5v5) to joust (3v3) and if that isnt enough you have a motd or a mode of the day which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of classic 5v5. a motd is a random mode with the rules changed whether it be extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone is already to the max level. in the end i could keep going about how amazing this game is ( i have played this for like a gazillion hours before it even came to steam) or i could just end on saying, if you want to try a moba game thats a little diffrent but still fun smite is your game!",1

14446,"just quoting another review i totaly agree with. stay away from this game. simply put, the development team (freejam) is utterly incompetent. there have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). instead, freejam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. this accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, freejam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.other major issues with the game:1) building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. in fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, freejam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did because freejam said so.2) significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. simply put, freejam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. in the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. there are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). 3) freejam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. they won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. instead, freejam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. things like clans have been on freejam's radar since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. the sad part is, by the time freejam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. 4) minimal skill required. if you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. freejam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. this might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.freejam: one step forward, two steps back. always.",0

(where is my t-34 breaking down because of their shoddy mass production) so 5.5/10 for me. too much pay too win and not enough motivation for me to keep it going.,0

5948,"update in comments. this is the first flight sim i've played since i built my pc, so forgive me if i don't know the pricing model for games like this. so i invested in a stick and throttle since i wanted to give flight simulation a chance, which was definitely worth it. it's truly amazing when you finally accomplish your first flight and start to get the feel for the aircraft. i've gotten to the point where i want to purchase a new plane that i can learn to dogfight with, so with a little bit of research i've learned that the p51 and the f15 are 2 of my the best options for beginners. along with that research, i find out that the developers have increased the pricing on content that has been out for several years already. i understand that it must take a lot of time and effort to make these realistic models, but $40 for 1 plane? (p51d) $80 for the newest release? that seems so highly priced as a newcomer. i would also gladly buy the f15 if the price wasn't raised 50%. it seems like in almost every other genre of gaming that would be taboo. being a new pc gamer there are a ton of games i want to play, and the last thing i want to do is join a community that is about to start getting shafted by price hikes. to buy the 2 planes (p51d+f15c) i want, it would cost me $55. i may just not understand the cost of making the product but that just seems ridiculous to me, especially since these items aren't even close to new.",1

4038,"tf2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. on its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, tf2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest. balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. however, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. it's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.the primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. with a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as tf2 won't do it for you.tf2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. with a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. on top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money. it has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. what tf2 offers is a rich fps experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. so i have no issues recommending this game to any fps fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.",1

2333,"been playing this game since 2014, little less than 4 years now, took a break during breach and prophecy league as i was playing other games. i never once doubted that ggg would keep developing a great game and trying it back during closed beta, i knew that they would bring us an arpg bringing us the d1 and d2 vibes that d3 failed to bring. now sitting in 2018 i was glad i stuck with this game and supported them through buying supporter packs and mtx from the cash shop. for new players i believe that the games learning curve has gotten easier with the ammount of guides from the community and ggg's own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character. although the curve to get into the game has gotten easier the challenge of earning currency, building a great character, and the endgame hasn't gotten any easier infact even harder. true poe has builds that make the game's content look like a joke and there will always be a meta, but the fun the game brings through running maps at endgame or simply leveling through acts 1-10 hasn't changed. i haven't always played on steam as there was client issues in multiple leagues so my hours haven't all been on record but i will say i have atleast 3k+ total hours and counting in this game and plan on many more.if people are doubting whether the game is truly free to play look at other reviews, go into the game yourself or even just watch videos. the game is truly free, it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop is strictly cosmetic and convenience. what i do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game is catch the sales they have weekly and always buy on sale, they run multiple stash tab sales and you should only really buy when they are on sale unless you are 1st starting out. i highly recommend buying 1 currency tab, 1 quad tab, 1 map tab, and 1 premium tab. essence, divination, and fragment tabs are pure convenience and really are only for those who truly want a tab for all the small things. if you cant spend 20$ on a game you can enjoy for hours at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you shouldn't be playing a f2p game at all.to close this wall of text, i recommend any new player who enjoys arpg, and the d1 and d2 to try this game, if you are simply wanting to cure your itch for lost ark or whatever other new arpg coming out in the future poe is a great way to do so. if you just simple enjoy arpg and want a fair cash shop, crazy build customization, and hours of fun then download and start playing.",1

2116,"this is my absolute favorite arpg to play. i loved diablo 2. this game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique diablo 2 / titan quest arpg. the rng is real, the challanges are fun. the content doesn't get dull. progression is limitless. knowledge is never ending. mechanics are so well done. the skills in this game are interesting. the ability to make any build you want is just simply the greatest. my cons: poor optimization, an ssd and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable fps.the highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. it's doable but likely expensive for solo players. not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.there is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. the lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't gamebreaking unless you have a bad pc.overall, if you've never played an aprg like this before, it make come off as too hard. the hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. what items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. all of this stuff simply takes time to understand. i've played this game since closed beta, on and off. i learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.this game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. this game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. this game is super competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.the content updates are constant, the gaming company, grinding gear games are simply the best of the best. on par with valve and sorta kinda blizzard-8-years-ago. there are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.if you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. but you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. this is always the biggest issue i see with new players. this is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to diablo 3. it isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.if you're my friend, hit me up, i will do everything i can to make you realize this game. it's fun, i love it. oh and it's 100% free to play. there is no pay to win. extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. that said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab. but it does make life easier.",1

11100,"enjoy this game a lot, the defense and faction mechanics set it apart from other ccgs. however i never recieved packs that were promised as part of a promotion that was actually the reason i bought in-game currency so until this issue is solved i will be leaving this review negative and advising against buying this game.issue solved, very responsive support. now onto an actual review of the game. first i'll start with the cons. i don't believe that eternal is the best or the most unique ccg ever. for me that honour would have to go to chronicle: runescape legends (r.i.p). i also disagree with what some others have said that this is the fairest ccg out there for f2p players. due to the sheer amount of deck faction combinations and the lack of any sort of cap on legendaries used in decks, there are a lot of high-cost legendary cards and the best decks contain a lot of them. you only have to do a quick search for eternal decks to see that many recommended decks contain upwards of 18 legendaries. you do earn coins very fast but not particularly faster than other ccgs. you are however given many more packs and single cards as rewards, and as far as i can tell the legendary drop rate is higher than most. however, i don't believe this entirely makes up for the card volume and cost to the point where you could call it the fairest on the market.on to the pros. while i said it is not the best or most unique ever, i certainly believe it is the best and most unique ccg out right now. the mechanisms force you to actually use your head. logic and math come into it more than most, if not all other games of this nature and you will find yourself in chesslike scenarios fairly often and will lose because of poor strategy rather than bad luck, such is the case with too many other digital card games.there is so much to do in this game, so many replayable game modes, including a vast singleplayer experience, something many will be grateful for. and the singleplayer campaigns are purchaseable with the relatively easily earned non-premium currency! as well as this you can keep all the cards you handpick in the forge and draft modes and, while the price of playing these modes is a little steep, you don't have to even play too well to earn at least half of it back. also, free cards.all-in-all, i would say this is worth your time if you've played similar games but are after something with a little more depth.",1
1242,"alpha review: not representative of final productfractured space. what a game. i have bought 3 copies of the game, one vanguard for myself and 2 forerunner packs for friends. i've been a living, breathing advertisement for fractured space and so far everyone i have recommended it to have agreed with me. fractured space is addicting. gameplay - 9/10i want to give the gameplay 10/10 but i feel like some of the cooldowns are a little long when compared to others. for example the phantom ghost (and by extension the ghost) has such a long cooldown on it's primary missles, which means after ambush -> missles you have to wait much longer than everyone else to start firing again. there are of course a few minor issues with balance with some ships but as for an alpha game the game is amazing. the gameplay revolves around huge space battleships blowing each other up. what's not to like?graphics - n/ai will give it n/a because there isn't many textures in the game. there are the asteroids, ships, mining/base ships and an endless expanse of space. yeah. exactly. with what we have, the graphics are great so there is no problem but i can't really review it. matchmaking - 8/10i like the matchmaking, not sure why there is an mmr system with no ranks but oh well. the queues can take a while and i can't seem to stop the queue if i want to invite someone or search for frontline/conquest instead of vice versa. the games seem balanced usually but there needs to be a penalty for disconnecting. in too many games does someone disconnect and there is only a 30% faster respawn time. we should get a damage buff for the loss of manpower too. if not then at least add a bot. it's better than nothing. progression - 8/10the progression seems rather slow. i can't seem to discern how your performance changes your exp/credits earned because it seems about the same whether you win or lose (the only difference being you earn massively less when you lose). then the exp for each faction takes forever to earn. i know you don't want people running around in the best ships right off the bat but it feels like i have been grinding for ages to earn my watchmann. overall score 9/10i really want to give the game 11/9 but with the few problems that i mentioned above (as well as some fps issues and ping which doesn't make sense. i get 200ping on london servers and 100ping on further away servers. i don't understand myself) however the game is a definite must buy. if they add a campaign it would only make the game better but i feel like they are going to go the counter strike route and not add a story, and just focus on the ships and gameplay which is already pretty polished. i've seen games in beta run less smooth..",1

9091,"let me be clear: this game takes some serious getting used to. you will be lost for the first several hours, and even after that, figuring out how you fit into your team's overall objective is going to be difficult. i had the major benefit of joining a platoon (a group of squads and squad leaders working together under the command of a platoon leader) early on, and doing so went a long way towards helping me understand how to play the game well. as an indavidual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team. this means picking a class and sticking to it for the most part. for those of you who think immediately: i want to snipe! some words of caution: you will be killed, counter-sniped, and pushed around a lot. in the begining, your kill count will be low, and firefights will be overwhelming. the scope of this game is massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console *cough* cod *cough*, just because you have a sniper rifle doesn't mean you're going to be a headhunting god out the gate: battlefield-esqe bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capabilities will see to that. you will likely be outperformed by hard-scopers if you try to play the quickscope game here, long weapon rechamber and reload times will ensure that. why? because this game does not feel that every soldier on the battlefield is equal, headshots cannot kill every target in one hit, especially depending on the rifle you use, with a fair few requiring two or more hits to kill regardless of where you hit your target. at a range beyond 400 meters, only the highest powered weapons will drop targets in one shot. only one faction specific weapon has the damage output to headshot most targets in one hit at any range: downside? it has a trigger delay and that will throw your shots way off target. starting to sound unfair? welcome to planetside, where every faction has very distinct pros and cons to its equipment sets and abilities. for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight: prepare to be outflanked, double teamed, and owned by vehicles en masse. your k/d is going to hurt in the begining. no two automatic weapons are equal in any way, find one that works well for you, and stick to it. with all of this said, this game is not newbie friendly: veteran players will have a more diverse set of weapons, better implants, and know many of the nooks and crannies you might try to hide in, advantage being, the layout of each continent has changed a few times over the years, so there are plenty of spots yet to be used frequently. this game is somewhat p2w, allowing you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster, however with the exception of a few differently colored weapon iterations, whose stats are exactly the same as the base model, nothing in this game is unobtainable by simply playing the game, but it is a grind, as is every mmo ever made. still sound like your kind of challenge? welcome to the battle for auraxis! pick your side, pick your guns, and strap yourself in, you aren't in kansas anymore!",1

2774,"thunder, where to start. (please read fully, as there are somethings i think need to change)this game used to be really fun back when it first came out, way before tanks were introduced. i used to love playing this game as it was basically world of warplanes but not autistic. the grind was almost no existant as you would get your next aircraft almost immedeatley if you did well enough. i used to love playing with friends as realistic battles were super fun an not old a drawn out as time went on. however, now, this game is just... sad. the grind fest is real and if you dont have premium time, preimum tanks/planes, or some advantage, its almost impossable to get any xp. i know that gaijin want to make money but i mean come-on. after tanks came out i was actually thinking the game was going to be so much better, but in recent years the tank gameplay is the exact same: load in, dowtiered, kill 1 tank, get 15xp, die, rinse and repeat. the plane gameplay is just about the same, load in, kill 1 plane, die and do it all over again. now unless you play only arcade, its somewhat breable, but realstic is god awfully broken. there is no teamwork, everyone is out for themselves to get the new amazing super sonic planes, or the new cold war tanks. i mean, who actually plays online games in hopes your team knows teamwork as a word, but its really bad in this game. other problems include aircraft ammo. i mean the .50's are decent, the 20mms are lackluster, and you just want to forget about the german 30mm cannons. i am not by far a wheraboo, but the german guns tend to suck... hard. sometimes you can literally dump all of your ammo into a plane and it never dies, or 2 rounds of ammo blow the plane up, literally.i hoped gaijin would actually listen to the player base about fixing issues with the game in terms of battle modes, ammo, and tanks, but all they seem to do, is come out with new maps or planes/ tanks/ helicopters. the battle modes are... well... special. its only one of two or three modes. assault, moded assult, or horrid assult. what i mean by this is, plane modes are all the same, destory bases, destory the airfield and you win, or kill all the other team. tank battle only consist of attack 1, 2 or 3 points. if you dont get atleast 2 points and hold them, you are done. another problem in the tank mode is the spawn camping and when i mean its bad, its bad. gaijin tried to remedy the issue by putting in a zone around the spawn for the enemies to not enter, and if they do, they die. but its 30 seconds, really? 30 seconds? it should be instant death, not only that but make it to where when you spawn in, your tank is protected until your leave the zone. i know it says i don't have a whole lot of hours on here, at least on steam, but overall i have around 6k-10k hours on this game. not saying i know all about this game, but i think i have a good sense of what i am talking about. what i would change are as follows: - i would balance out the ability to make money/ exp, you make more per battle as it used to be. - stop putting in new planes and tanks every patch, so those that are possibly op can be investigated and repaired. - balance out ammo, and make it to where all the ammo preforms close to historical abilities.- ammo for tanks will be ablanced out to historical battle field capabilities as well. armor valuse would be recorrected into their historical abilities. i know this is a lot, but this game has some real potential, but they (gaijin) isn't willing to fix the game. thanks for reading.",0

3713,"positive review because even though the wall of text is 100% negative, we need you all to keep playing and voice your opinions loudly so that valve will do something about the horrible mess they've created.the meet your match update was a mistake, the community has been in a constant state of outrage, outcry, and complete and total dismay, and all valve has done about it is put on their fake god damn business smile and say, we're sorry. we'll band-aid some of the minor problems right away, without even acknowledging the one, major f*ckup, removing valve pubs and the quickplay system in general.quickplay was not only for valve pubs. it was also used by many to find community servers. one of those networks that was highly affected by quickplay lost 70% of their playerbase over the last few weeks. i'm talking about tf2 app. they are shutting down this saturday. because valve won't acknowledge the one major problem with this update. they won't even say we're sorry about pubs. they won't say anything. if you wanna know exactly how kill your own game, just grab some in' popcorn and watch. the absolute most frustrating thing a company can do is completely ignore the entire customer base's main complaint about a product/update. this is how you drive out old players, and discourage new ones from coming in. it isn't rocket science, valve. this game is 9 years old, man. up until last month, it still had a concurrent 60,000 players. we're loyal as hell. we are loud as hell, but that doesn't make us less loyal. speak to us with your mouth words, valve. use phonetic syllables to make sounds that our human ears will recognize, alternatively, use your fingers to press the buttons on your keyboard that would make up those aforementioned phonetic syllables. it's literally that simple. open your god damn mouths and stop being so silent. the age old excuse of we just dont wanna talk about stuff until we're sure it's ready to talk about doesn't exactly apply here. it was cute when people were asking about hl3. now we're talking about whether or not one of the top 10 games on steam is going to die, by your own hands. get off your asses.",1

8367,"neverwinter is a pretty cool f2p mmo. so far (lvl. 26) i haven't noticed any paywalls preventing f2p players from advancing . the game has a nice farming/grinding system to give f2p players some cool stuff. overall, the game seems fair and is pretty fun. the questline is focused and doesn't branch out a lot, but this is not necessarily a bad thing because the quest givers are fully voiced and the quests offer more than just the typical go there, collect/kill x of something, esspecialy towards the higher levels. i think the game is nicely catered to newbie mmorpg-ers, but it also offers veterans a good run for their money, or in this case for free!",1

6448,"take this into considerations before you even put any time into this game; it's reviews are mixed. if that isnt enough to turn you away from this game, than i'll delve deeper.the trailers are the greatest part of this game, it makes up for the game's lack of in-game music. grinding takes forever in terms of exp to earn your next weapon, and credits to buy your next weapon.this game is pay to lazy, not pay to win. everything in the game can be unlocked with in-game currency without ever having put a penny into it. however, these pay to lazy prices are absurd, ranging in the 100s.the community is absolutely horrendus. alongside the forums, there has had to be major censoring on all three factions, in the game. you will see a lack of sportsmanship.due to the game's lack of combined arms, you'll be out of luck if you thought this game would be where you can renact your favorite fury scene where brad pitt fires an stg. 44 at a german from an m4a2e8 sherman. you will never be able to spawn with a mosin nagant as a german or vice versa.the developers take years to respond to certain kinds of feedback, reto displays heavy examples of selective listening where certain factions recieve more or less attention due to their paying playerbase. it has taken years for a glitch in plane dogfighting in which one pilot could instant-kill the other without damaging their plane.i will probably be banned if the reto community manager sees this. because like many others, people have been banned for giving this game a review it truly deserves. however, i'm fine with this. the heroes and generals that i started playing two years ago has radically changed. and will continue to change.if you still decide to play this game. you'll have a fun 2 hours before you realize the heavy gripes of this game.",0

5140,"brawlhalla; an online steam version of smash brothers, if you will. like plenty of other all-out multiplayer fighting games, your outlook on this game really depends on your outlook of fighting games in general; if you're a competitive player, you'll probably be a nuisance and complain about the slightest flaws in the games, characters or level design and get turned off my minor issues like that. if you play for fun, however, you'd enjoy the multiplayer experience alongside the fact that it is able to be played with a controller, so no keyboard troubles for you (that is, if you have the usb corb & controller)! the characters are notably memorable from the gnarly overpowered gnash to the hustling surprisingly female hattori. each have their own different weapon choices, which makes for different scenarios and unique battles, so long as you don't annoyingly and unnecessarily complain about their being overpowered or flaws, as that's personal and others can totally prove you wrong. as of now, new characters are being added to the shop, alongside the prior dlc in the forms of valkris, (as you spell it in-game) weapon skins and costume skins. each one is unique, and if you got some spare money or would care to costume up some of your personal favorite brawlhalla characters, go for it! a few bucks would be worth it on a unique look. the recently-new level system made it so that you could obtain gold, skin colors and prior stances for each character. the only problem with the leveling system can get quite tedious a certain of levels in, it's still worth it for some prior stances, skin colors and gold for future characters. they have a ranking system and just a 'for fun' online free-for-all option. the ranking system goes from bronze and progresses a few gems up, and just try not to get frustrated as if you lose, you're likely to get deranked depending on your rank. one notable advantage from brawlhalla opposed to smash brothers is the lack of long updates required to go online and the relative ease of being able to connect online and join a room with friends, not to mention it's quite easy to drop out and spectate. although brawlhalla is still being updated and some of the stages are either opinionatedly bland, trippy, or just frustrating, brawlhalla is an amazing steam versioned substitute for smash brothers, and although it isn't quite as good, it is definitely worth the $13 purchase. keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and outlook of the game, so if you have your own, feel free to let me know! 9/10; a clauds recommended online smash brothers :]",1

13969,"after reading countless uneducated and irrational reviews about infestation: newz, which have came from many people who have hardly played the damn game, i've finally decided to speak some truth and make an honest review myself. first off as a player who has a fairly decent amount of hours on the new z and having over a thousand on iss, i can tell you some key differences that make two identical games different in so many ways. a major factor between the two are the developers. the new z team (which is a completely different group of people btw) actually getdone. if something is broken and a majority complain about it, they fix it. if there's a bright idea that would be a great addition to the game in terms of loots or skins, they add it. in my years of playing iss since 2013 and the new z since 2016, i've noticed a massive change in terms of loot, skins, anti-cheat, maps, game modes, trading, and events within 6 months, than what i've seen from iss in 4 years! it's truly amazing because the new z is finally on steam and is averaging 5k + players daily, they have an anti-cheat that actually works, loot is extremely easy to come by and you can log out and insta bank it as you please (hoarders welcome), and they must be doing something right because they are slowly bringing the game back into the glory it should've been given to begin with. i understand the new z isn't for everyone, i understand iss did some pretty messed up but that doesn't mean you hold a grudge against a game with different interests. anyways, it's one of those games that is highly recommended to play with a group, it's one of those games where it takes time not to get messed up by other players, and it's one of those games that is very enjoyable in terms of action and pvp. from my past experiences with the other branch offs of iss, such as iss thailand, iss worlds, iss/warz and a few others, i'd say the new z is my favorite. in the end though, it's free, so what do you have to lose? try it. don't. i did and i have zero regrets.",1

15518,"i played this when i was still in school apart from tons of other games. i liked it but the reason i ended up quitting was because you had to pay to unlock perks, locations, extra stuff or special items and quests. that sucks for a game that more kids and teenagers play than adults or young adults. so thats why i stopped playing, if i wanted neat stuff i had to pay and as a 15 year old, your parents wont pay for anything like this unless they just dont care about spending a lot on a game. it is early access and i want to see where this goes, and here are all the pros and cons in my own opinion of it so far.pros:-fun game-ok graphics-fun story if you bother to read or watch the cutscenes-fun characters including the monsters-crafting system-lts of things coming soon from the 2d game which were also interesting-tracking system- (needs work)-lots of potentialcons:-already pay to get ahead... this ruins tons of games for me and it ruined this one for me years ago with its membership pay to get access stuff. also i wanted to buy some potions and they cost 200 gems?!?!? i have to pay real money to buy beginners pitions?!?!-too much farming. i get to craft you have to farm, but the ammount sucks and everyone is farming the same things.-cost to gain ratio. very poor. quests are the minor acception, but the amount of gold you get to how much you have to spend sucks really badly including how much it sells for and if you need materials, it costs 2x as much as what you have. crafted items are worse, you pay 50 gold and farm to get someting, get and craft someting better and sell the other crafted item for 2 gold...-bad tracking system. i cant find 2 quests because no matter where i go it wont track where they are so i never found them.-bag system. too cluttered. needs something to sort or at least have it set up differently than it is now. not major, but its not good.-action bar. i dont need auto attack to be there, thats pointless... also maybe allow that to be moved around so i can have a potion in the action bar? quicker than pressing u and use. but i havent explored the key binding menue so thats probably my own fault.dont get me wrong, its good and i hope it improves but for a free game, you pay for a lot more than membership. i mean why do i need gems to buy starter potions? why do i need to pay for items that should be free. if i want to pay, it should be for membership only or if i want to buy special items. again, pay to get ahead or to be better than everyone else games ruin the whole structure of a game and its content. i get developers need the money to improve, but to make a majority ptw, thats gonna make some people turn to something else. if we want to pay, great, but why does so much have to be paid for with real money? i mean, if you have thousands of players and half of those buy regular memberships and the other half the 50$ option, dont you think that not almost everything needs to be paid for? i will keep playing to see where this goes because i want to see how this improves, but if it just stays as a pay to win kind of mmo, then it's just going to sink to the bottom of the barrel like the 2d one did (for me anyway), and other games that dont rely too heavily on this system will come out on top. this has so much potential but potential can only go so far.",1

7181,"i've been putting off writing a review for this game for a while. i felt, as a tcg, in order to get an accurate grasp on the game i needed to play a lot. i've gotten to level 40 of 50, own all dlc, and have collected a good portion of the cards in the game at the moment. here are some notes:value. you do not need to pay a dime if you do not want to and you could (hypothetically) get as much out of this game as someone who pays to win. there is in-game currency in the form of both gold and soulgems; the former is used to buy packs, decks, dlc, enter drafts, ext. it can buy most things (aside from some promo content). you rack up gold just by playing the game, or even watching streamers play it on twitch. the soulgems are used to craft specific cards, allowing you to avoid buying hoardes of packs just to get a couple singles you are chasing. along side all of this, you now get daily rewards just from logging on, along with daily quests you can complete for gold. all in all, very satisfied with the ingame currency and microtransaction system used for this game; balanced, fair, and well worth.content. even though the game only has 2 sets out (excluding dark brotherhood and other promo/dlc content), the variety of gameplay along with modes of play is vast. it is a brewers paradise for constructed, and the draft system in great and very easy to get the gold to play. there are even quest story lines which implement various gameplay changes to make the experience feel unique and fresh. my only complaint with the current meta is it vastly favours the late-game. aggro is very hard to make work, usually relying on the other decks inconsistencies and luck. prophecies, while a good idea on paper, do not help with this, resulting in one of the only succesful aggro decks in competeitve right now to also bank on prophecies. hopefully in the future, as with many other tcg's, more cards will eventually lead to more viable early game and thus better aggro in the meta. for now, expect board wipes, ramp, and boardclogs.flavor. god i love the elder scrolls series and the universe it encompases. every card is beleivable in regards to tes lore and feel. if you like the idea of getting into a strategy card game and love tes, this is your opening.all in all, i like the game. i still think my tcg of choice is magic, but this still takes a good cut of my dedication and resources due to the uniqueness of it. very standout game, worth a few hours of your time to give it a try.",1

7369,"finished the story in 3 hours. arena is quite cool, but overall? it's not worth spending money on. the second story is about as long as the first and they want gbp19.99 to unlock? i think not. pros: free to playthe one story you get is pretty goodthe mechanics are probably better than hearthstone, which is it's closes rival.the deck types are quite cleverly laid out and have good internal synergy: willpower is generally about helping your creatures out, whilst intelligence is all about direct damage and synergising off of action cards for example. arena is fun, microtransactions will get you back in, though i'm not sure you get the cards you pick which is a let-down. cons: cost. it's microtransaction based, fine, but don't then charge me most of the cost of a full title for one < 3 hour story expansion. you've got to be kidding. complexity: for all that it's probably better than hearthstone, it's not a patch on magic: the gathering, the mechanics just aren't deep enough. very pay 2 win: didn't pay out for the booster packs? sucks to be you then. all in all it's a nice idea, but it's nothing more than a transparent cash grab in the end with some clever mechanics, though outdone by magic, pokemon and even yu-gi-oh. if they lower the costs, then the story modes might keep you interested for a while, but as of right now, play it until you've done the free stuff, then drop it and don't look back.",0

6420,"this game is a really mixed bag, so it was hard to me to decide whether i recommend it or not.but now i've made up my mind, i do not.the game itself is really enjoyable with different maps and career paths to take.there's a lot to like in this game.however a lot of these types of games get ruined by their economy or atleast fractions of their economy and h&g is no exception.the guns are overpriced and overpowered. if someone uses real money to purchase a gun you'll feel it, the game is very much, pay to win.free credits are not well balanced, specifically designed to be hard to earn to buy new weapons, so that you'll be more tempted to use your hard earned cash.you think that if a game was to have hard to earn rewards, it'd take a planetside 2 approach, and make all guns have strengths, weaknesses and be overall balanced. but they are not. the thompson for example is the be all end all of submachine guns, i picked one up from an enemy and a quick burst of 3 bullets to the chest was all it took to down an enemy.however with the grease gun, america's starting smg it took around 20, requiring the full clip if you miss.the german starting smg is also stronger than the grease gun as well.there's not a large variety of guns either, which makes me question it a little, considering that i remember a larger array of weaponry in similar ww2 shooters.the game is fun, refreshing even, however the unfairness of it's economy and weapon tier system really ruin the fun.unbalanced weaponry and inconsistent weapons between both factions, leaves something to be desired.this game would really benefit from leaving it's limitations, creating a third fictional faction to make battles 3 ways, or even adding the ability for 3 way battles which would include weaponry specific to that faction based in that time frame.this game is in need of a massive overhaul in order to improve player satisfaction and balance between all players, new and long running.also, a quick mention for server maintenance, this game is riddled with it, atleast 30% of the time when i want to jump on, there's server maintenance, and this isn't for short periods of time, these are long downtimes, that when the time to be taken is predicted, takes anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, and when the maintenance is unexpected bugfixes or anything along those lines, the game can be done for a whole night, with no time given to players as to when it'll be back up.my verdict: a good game turned sour by it's online shop.6/10",0

2633,"the game as it is pretty good. i would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher / dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent. events are just tedious, mind numbing grinding. a recent event required you to do over 100 games within 3 days to get a tank or plane. or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for 40 bucks. ground forces (tanks) is even more grinding than air forces. it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation. or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money. the ground forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank. for example: you have to research fire extinguishers. that can take a decent amount of games. especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank. while you watch. being unable to do anything. or well, you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money you have to train your crew. not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to 6 (?) crew members in tanks. you have to train every single one of them individually. or you spend some bucks on them. air rb battles are unchanged since the game came out. they are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks. you often come out with just as much sl (in game currency to buy stuff) as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs their balancing methods are just bad. instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week, they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank (or plane for that matter) for months again. naval forces have been in closed access (meaning you have to pay to play them) for over a year now in the steam screenshots you can see u-boats. there are no u-boats in the game. they only have been in the game for one day (april fools)the list goes on. that's just what i have in my mind right now. you can take a look at more posts like these:/r/warthunder general rant/r/warthunder about repair costs/r/warthunder about their horrible pr/r/warthunder about repair costs ii",0

1275,"well, it has been many months since i posted my original review, and i now have close to 150 hours in fractured space. i definitely reccomend the game--it has many good moba-like aspects, but it puts an entirely new and orignal spin on the very concept of a moba.like other mobas, there are some skins and certain resources that can only be acquired through real-world currency, but for the most part, the game rewards and encourages playing matches to earn resources; a great example of this are the missions. there are 3 sets of missions that a player can strive to complete at any time, and the rewards, while somewhat randomized, are usually worth the effort. these missions require the player to achieve certain accomplishments within pvp or quickplay (vs robots) matches, within the mission's time-limit (for example, a mission may ask you to get 36 kills with a heavy ship). the point is, these missions have set up a fun and motivating mechanic to encourage and reward frequent and skilled play.the ships themselves, as well as the environment in which games take place, are well-balanced, creatively designed, and stunningly beautiful. graphics requirements are not too demanding, and server latency is generally good.as for gameplay?spaceships. shooting. other. spaceships.it's every bit as amazing as it sounds.addendum:though i still reccomend this game wholeheartedly, and i have greatly enjoyed it (250 hours and counting as of this addition), i feel i should warn potential players that, depending on your location and what time of day you choose to play, you may have trouble finding a game. and, during these periods of time when few players are online, you may be matched with players far above and below your skill-level. this can be frustrating for obvious reasons--imagine a league of legends matching diamond players with bornze players. but, it doesn't happen every game, and as long as you try to learn and play intelligently, the community will happily help you get better at the game. **the fractured space official discord channel is an especially useful and friendly resource to meet other players, get advice, and learn about the game**.",1

5750,"first of all it may show i only have 2.2 hours on record but that is because i use the stand-alone version of dcs. i will still leave a review as both versions are near enough the same.first of all i see a lot of reviews, positive and negative, refering to this as a game. even if the devs did call this a game at one point it is not strictly the case. this is nearer a professional flight simulator than it is a game. so if you are looking for an arcade flying game and not a simulator, look elsewhere.i have played dcs for a while now and i also own a fair few of its modules and i have to say i thoroughly enjoy it. it is a beautiful flight sim with an enormous amount of attention paid to detail. not kidding, there is so much detail on certain mdules that even the circuit breakers and air vent slits are modeled. the majority of modules also come with an extremely detailed exterior and damage model and they also come with a professional flight model which makes dcs a leader in realistic combat aircraft handling characteristics. it is comparable to x-plane 11 commercial aircraft flight models, but dcs exceeds x-plane 11 in the combat aircraft flight models. but this is just a light comparison as these two programs were made for different purposes.now before i make my final round-up, i would like to address the reviews which complain about the prices of modules being the same as aaa games. they are that price because of the research and development costs which goes into those modules. as they put so much detail in their modules it takes a lot of time and money and frankly, looking at the finished products, you can see that it cost them a lot. so for those reviews saying it is not their real value, think again, for what you get is aaa game quality. you even get a frikin 500+ page manual on all modeled systems and combat employment for your plane/ helicopter.final verdict: dcs is the best combat flight simulator you can get on the market. with beautiful worlds and highly detailed modules its hard not to be impressed by it. the learning curve is huge but if you are patient enough you will get to grips with your plane and the sense of achievment you get when reaching a level of competency in your chosen module(s) is fantastic. sure there are a few bugs here and there but it is rare nowadays to see a prgram without fault. in the end, i would recomend this to patient flight simers looking for a good combat aircraft sim and for people looking for arcady gameplay and easy learning then look somewhere else. this game is compatible with vr and being a vr user myself, it just makes it even more thrilling, especially as they are starting to add oculus touch support.",1

12533,"after almost two years of floaty physics, stuttering, bad communication, outrageous prices and lack of racing, r3e is finally turning around. regular sales bring the content to more sensible prices, the force feedback has been tightened up to give better information about the car, the physics are more precise and very detailed and the setup makes a big difference. most of the racing right now is in the dtm series, but the challenges are fun and allow you to try several cars and tracks without paying a dime. visually, it's a bit bright and bold, but the environments look good and clear. visibility and details are high, and the shadows passing on the dashboard look really nice. the performance on high settings with 8x aa with a 750ti is 60 fps when there's only one car, so i think the optimization is pretty good as well.the sounds are probably the best you'll hear in a racing game, whether it's the samples themselves or just the richness of the chassis squeaking, the transmission, the tires, etc. everything is there and sounds great. no other game comes close.the interface is still complex and confusing, and some options are only available from the main menu. the ffb is very adjustable, but the settings are not explained much, so it takes a lot of fiddling to get everything right. for me, that means g25 and th8rs. the modern cars don't default to auto-clutch, which is lame. because the game looks and sound so good, and now that the ffb is finally letting the new and tighter physics shine through, raceroom is becoming a killer racing game. i never thought it could be possible, but out of this could arise a gtr3 people have hoped for. in the meantime, doing time trials, challenges and racing in dtm is a lot of fun.to newcomers: skip the free content and go straight for the competitions, this is where the higher quality content is. it cycles through cars and tracks regularly, so you can sample stuff until you find what you like. the freebies are still the old wobbly garbage from 2012, it seems. i think everything will be updated over time.",1

6012,"the game is a lot of fun to play, for a simulator, has a lot of dynamic environment that is set to make the player feel like they're flying in real life, really love the thrust effects on the jets, has a very basic mission editor, very easy to use, setting up single player scenarios, multiplayer scenarios or even some free flight and training missions, and every mission has it's own difficulity/visibility options that you get to check/uncheck for your preferences. first i've tried the free version of the su-25t mastered it then got the fc3 dlc to master too, the game gets a little difficult at the beginning and seems very hard to master, with all the key-rebindings for your flightstick, but there are quite handy forums which you need to check to help you with all of these, so i pretty much recommend it for those who love realism, dealing with the g-force and playing tactically at flying.however, here's my negative thoughts about it, but now, before you carry on and reading, know this, i know that lot of people might know things about this game better than i do, so they might tend to disagree or agree but please try to read this and think of the way that you could develope the game cuz i sure am trying to point out a thing or two as a point of interest.1really loved the su-25t it's a sead & anti-ground target suppression attack aircraft, and i really loved seeing the basic su-25, but i did not like the way the cockpit was built, the hud seemed a bit slope hanging the corsshair right at the top of it, that is almost not visible or easy to shoot targets with, especially when trying to engage evasive maneuvering air targets, plus, it seems possible for me to switch between the gun and the master-arm or the missile mod, but it's just impossible to switch from a missile to another, i tried it but it just did not work, knowing that fact that i double checked re-binding the keys for that and still it's a no-go.2i noticed that you're releasing aircrafts that are pretty old, yet on your loading screen description, it says that the real manufactorurs of the aircrafts have nothing to do with the modules represented on your game, may then try releasing newer aircrafts, at least matching the new in-service su-35b flanker instead of the su-27, the su-37 terminator instead of the su-33, the f-15c with it's new processor and modern radar scanning systems, the mig-29a/g/s with the modern mig-29k with it's electronic and touch screen navigation screens?su-25 1978.su-27 1982 ~ su-35s flanker 2007.su-33 1987 ~ su-37 1996.f-15c 1976 (introduction).i'm pretty sure you won't have any problem estimating the 5th generation aircraft's supermaneuverability (sm) abilities in your game, neither will you have problems publishing any aircrafts from the previous list of aircrafts provided above.3 during my test aerobatic flights that i've been doing for the last 20-30 hours i was able to perform some good maneuvers, one by the other until i came about the most crusial russian aerobatic maneuvers with the su-33 and the su-27 which were the 360 kullbit (frolov chakra) and the cobra (pugachev cobra) back spin, i was not able to perform any of these maneuvers until i got to know that these maneuvers can only be performed by using the vectoring thrusts, and you guys did not privde this optic in the russian 4th generation su-27 and the su-33 which was rather disappointing for an aerobatic airshow lover, here's the video explaining what i meant by these maneuvers exactly. and last i'd really love to see more interactive accessories in the aircrafts cockpits, (e.g.) one can simply choose to press buttons on their keyboard/flight stick, or active the mouse clicking (left alt + c) and ticking the radars, flaps, gear and missiles even on non-fully simulated aircrafts, just the simple accessories for a good feeling's sake.thank you very much for reading here's some of the new 4~5th generation cockpit's pictures. more on google, the web's your bestfriend. :)",1

2586,"two years ago i would have recommended this game. now i can't.i don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call war thunder a simulator), so i can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.but i can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.there are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. when you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. at the start of the game it isn't too bad. a low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. that's 9 games, fair enough.the problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. to get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the fw 190-d9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. that's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.that means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. want to get a jet? play 500 matches.the game doesn't reward you for playing well either. even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the mvp, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. it's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. on top of that, gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. they could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. this means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. so to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time i mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. rp gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since i started playing. this is also why i have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly.this makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why i quit playing it.now the second issue - balance. this one is a lesser issue to me because i didn't play game for historical matchups.the game uses a system called battle rating to match different planes together in a battle. a plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. the problem is that the battle rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.you will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.keep in mind that world war 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.the result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he 112-a0, f2a buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course i'd get next to no reward for this, but i sure would make a lot of people frustrated).in the case of the he 112-a0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.on the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in realistic battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.so why do these matchups exist? that you can ask only gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in war thunder.this brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.any of the above will likely never be fixed. the developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. they don't read the english forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.the way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. the post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. there are many more problems with the game that i haven't mentioned because i haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).i'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.everything works perfectly well in gaijin-land, comrade! (except it doesn't).tl;dr:if you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. it is free after all. but it's a waste of your time.",0

13240,"short review:i think this is a good game, but if you are looking to sate your hex/square tactics thirst for free, go play card hunter. it is a better game.things that make this game good: the art is pretty great. everything has character and detail. the colors are nice and cheery. if you love tactics games like this, there is about 40 hours of solid content before you start wondering if you have seen everything, and 40 hours of enjoyable playtime for free is all i need to know to give this a thumbs up. basically there are about 5 or 6 different game modes, and for me it took these 40 hours to believe i understood how each one works.bad things: there are some people that have either bought their way to the high levels or have inherited a long standing account from pre-release days, but if you look through all the clans, i find very few people who make it past level 10. it may just be that this game only came out a month ago, but i feel that there is a really solid paywall that you hit around level 9.the main issue i have with this game is that the way the payment system is constructed, it is kind of like a free-to-try / pay-to-win thing here. this is because your characters level up with cards, and you can buy cards with money. sure, i know that the developers have to make money, but i don't think this is the best way. in my short review at the top of this, i mentioned card hunter. one of the things which card hunter does exceptionally well i think is that you spend money not on advantages over other players, but on bonus content - unlocking new dungeons and such.a few other things: it is a bit deja vu-ish that many of the characters in this game feel like they were either ripped out of warcraft, put through a heroes of might and magic 3 filter, and pulled into a game named tactical monsters. i sometimes wonder if the actual developer is some guy who made monsters for blizzard or just another guy like me that still plays homm3 all the time and wonder if maybe they can't do better than ubisoft. i mean, you can't do any worse right?it could also just be a testament to how influential these games have been that they have possibly become fantasy tropes. i.e. the harpy, the grunt, the gobin shredder, the night elf archer, the elf riding a tiger, and on and on.",1

14999,"used to play this game back in the good old days. back before you had flying and the energy shield stuff. put about $40 into it and a little over 140 hrs. stopped shortly after the raming blade things were added since they had changed it so much. to my dissapoitment, it seems that the developers have taken the game in a completely different direction then the fun game i had enjoyed 3 years ago. redownloaded the game and right off the start it informs me that some of my items have become obsolete. i was like alright thats fine hopefully i can build something cool that functions i look garages and don't see too much. then i try and build a new robot, here is where the problem comes in. -i only have t1 blocks, i have robots that have t5 and t4 blocks built in, but none of my inventory has any blocks but t1 blocks unlocked. -next problem, i try and look for a tech tree, see the tech tree was one of those things i actually really enjoyed about robocraft, you could branch off into certain areas and maybe you would have t2 or 3 lasers but would have t6 blasters bc you prefered blasters over the more sniper focused lasers. the tech tree, gone, couldn't find it anywhere. looked at some wiki pages and i find that the tech tree has been removed.-problem three, i downloaded the game i would say a year ago when they started to do all these changes. now given from when i had first stopped playing until the time i redownloaded a year ago they changed how garages worked. you used to have to buy garages with money that you bought. the money i spent on the game went primarily to buying garages so i could test new designs out. the problem i had when i redownloaded was that first they didn't reimburse me for the credits that i payed for with my money for the garages that are now free and second they removed the remaining ingame cash i had spent actual money on to get, not the currency you earn from playing matches but the stuff you get from spending money. i proceed to send emails every day for 2 weeks asking where the money i spent went and if they would reimburse me with either ingame currency or some other means. no response. the devs just took my money, didn't say oh hey here is a replacement, just took it and i think that's what pisses me off the most is the fact that they took my money, changed the system so what i spent my money on was now useless, didn't reimburse me, and ontop of that removed all the other currency that i spent actual money on away from my account.2015 robocraft 92/100:amazing gameallowed for creativityhad a tech treewas much simplier and a lot of joke designs actually sometimes workedyou weren't scammed out of your moneythere was a slow grind when you hit t72018 robocraft 6/100:scammed me out of my moneydoesn't have a tech treehas weird progression systemdesigns don't seem to be as open to creativity and functionality at the same time, pick one or the otherdo explination of new systemif a dev or someone on the team would reach out to me and help me get my currency back it would be much appreciated.also have more ideas on how the game could possibly be improved if a dev would like some input since seems that some of the devs do respond. overall though this game has really been on the decline and i wouldn't recommend the game to anyone, go play world of tanks or another game by wargaming, they make nice games and don't scam you out of the things you buy",0

14881,"the last major update really dumbed down the game, before you would have to really put some thinking into parts purchase, get better armor cubes? or shields? or guns? one had to play with th diferent cubes armor rating in order to protect the vital parts of the robot (besides other things). now if you just make a bot with a bunch of blocks and strap a bunch of guns and you can survive for ages! before one could get one shot kill with bombers or railguns if hit the right robot spot, now it takes forever to destroy pretty much anyone because everyone uses the same blocks. block type is one variable removed that helped to make the game challenging.a bad remark also for the non-compensation on blocks when the update was made, some of us have spent a lot on blocks and that was a waste of time and money for some. i'm glad i didn't spent any money on this game otherwise i would lose the investment in blocks. i don't recomend to spend money on this game because you can lose your items overnight in some crazy update or your item can be rendered useless by an updateanother one is the pilot seat removal, it helps to create diferent shapes of robots, but now you don't have to protect your sweet spot! again, making the game easier by removing the sweet spot and the limitations the pilot seat had.the worst one is the auto healing, this completly changed the game dynamics! before you had to think on how to build your robot even for the case it would get damaged, making sacrificial parts to be blown when under attack. also you had to put some extra locomotion parts, in case you would lose wings, wheels, etc. when under attack. now you have auto healing! no need for this! just hover your bot over a mountain, if someone shoots you down, just lay on there hidden (when possible) and wait to be up and running again! same for tanks, just hide in a corner when your health is getting low.before the update you would think twice before engaging, now everyone is kamikaze! before you could damage an airplane or tank useless with a couple of shots, so people would be carefull when atacking, now everyone just charges ahead full steam! also untill the introduction of the aa canon, the game was quite unbalanced, air units had a massive advantage because of the hit and run tatic, t10 block and the auto regen.only good remark was the introduction of colours.al said, i think the game was dumbed down in order to attract more people and to please fustrated users who couldn't do a good robot or use them properly. the developers want to please everyone and attract more people making the game more arcadish but they are scaring some fans away and killing the thing that made the game special, i know i don't play as much asi used to!it was a very good and addictive game now i guess it's just ok, something to fill that 10 min break.ps: sorry for any misspeling, no spell check was used.",0

13094,"i've already spent almost 100 hours playing this game on the windows store, and i have to say that it's one hell of a time waster. fallout shelter doesn't have any specific goal in mind, so you can spend your spare time increasing your vault's population (and have your own gary-themed whacko-fest); training your dwellers' special stats for gameplay bonuses; or send them all out in the wasteland, and battle a dozen deathclaws, for that chance to find a rare item - just remember to send them back to the vault if you're going to exit the game, because the timer keeps ticking even when you're out, and reviving a dead vault dweller costs a lot of caps. tip for new players: a high food level keeps everyone happy and smiling in the face of danger; therefore, invest in it early in the game (or send the useless dwellers out to die in the wilderness), because it dwindles fast if you have too many people.overall, a fun casual game. there are microtransactions available, but your vault can survive even without purchasing any of them. you might have to spend more time playing and managing if you want some of the loot that can be purchased in the store, but a day or two of waiting wouldn't hurt.and there you have it.",1

16354,"don't bother. developer is a nutless piece ofthat obviously doesn't know how to run a db. the game's back-end is a complete mess. expect to have your recent activity wiped at any time because of server issues (this has happened several times in the last few weeks) and then be completely ignored while asking for help in the forum (unless maybe you've actually made use of the microtransactions or dlc? i guess free players don't ever translate into paying players?). you can also expect to have your account deleted in it's entirety if you are inactive for 6 months, which in my opinion is only proof of the cluster they call a back-end.personally i lost in excess of 10,000xp i was saving to unlock the next gun, when their servers crapped it a few weeks ago. despite their forum post explaining and asking people who have lost progress to reply, several weeks have passed while i personally have been completely ignored. and i have screenshots! they seem unable or unwilling to trace my account activity to verify my claim and re-instate my lost earnings (that cannot be earned again because in-game achivements are still registered as complete). their preferred method of explaining that they can't or won't help is to literally just completely ignore me.the game itself is fine. it's functional and does exactly what it says on the tin, but the database is strung together with spiderwebs and old coathangers. there's not much more to say about the game itself - it's fine. it has few bugs. it works. it's exactly what you'd expect and no more. in-game progress can be frustrating as the entire web of possible guns is not shown, with only the next 2 guns in any particular branch having visible icons and only the immediate next actually being named. if you want to unlock a specific or favourite gun, good luck trying to find out how to get to it!english is not the first language of the developer, which is obvious from reading the forum posts from them. that in itself is fine as they do an adequate job of communicating (when they decide your comments or questions are worth responding to at all - despite their claims of how active they are in their community; re: not actually active at all), but anyone who has been gaming for long enough should know that russian devs areat what they do. this trend continues here. also, thanks to one of the in-game achievments, do not be surprised if you have randoms requesting steam friend accepts just for the achievment. you can also expect to see cheaters on the high scores board every day, plus the high scores are broken, almost always with your faster time being displayed and ranked below someone with a slower time.if all this sounds like fun to you, then have at it! this player, however, has had enough.",0

6228,"originally, i would have written a positive review about this game. i enjoyed playing this game with friends, and in groups. but after a while, this game just gets extremely repetetive and boring, and if you don't pay, you'll have to sit hours and hours xp farming, just to progress in rank.the microtransactions have ridiculously high prices aswell, and the developers are extremely greedy. this is one of the worst pay-to-win games i have ever played, and i'd advise you to stay far away from this game.you should rather give verdun or red orchestra a try. they may not be as good as in tankmen, airplanes, paratroopers etc, but atleast they're not pay-to-win. it was a huge mistake for me to return to pay to win games.never again.1/10 - terrible game",0

10920,"there's supposedly a lot of cards, but most serve little purpose outside draft. bold adventurer? horned vorlunk? any number of other cards are just worse than utility rares and legendries that have lower costs, superior abilities &c. as to cards like dormant sentinel or similar high power cost cards, they don't serve much purpose outside draft, as even though they have good stats, any decent opposing deck will make key plays long before 7-drop becomes relevant. i'd guess you could chop at *least* 25% of cards without impacting 85% of players in ranked or gauntlet modes (with the 15% exception being those players that are basically just starting out and need cards of any kind to fill out decks).pros: not as grindy as shadowverse, not as buggy as most magic: the gathering online releases, not as simplistic as hearthstone, not as pushed-into-playing-the-market as hex, has graduated design allowing players to amass commons and uncommons, then rares, without paying in (though they *will* have to grind)cons: apart from the obvious grind and players without utility rares/legendaries being second class citizens - neither of which i consider *terrible* considering design aspects that compensate for each of those to *some* degree - what it comes down to for me is the game just doesn't have anything to offer apart from what it *does* offer. it's sort of like going to a buffet and everything you see is pretty well made, but there's only five selections. you just feel like something's missing.",0

8976,"downloaded it a couple days ago, played 16 hours straight, it's very smooth, addicting and huge mmofps, it isn't just a fps, the game works a lot like real war, infantry need air support and tank support to take locations, in total they're hundreds of locations to take, faction choices are more preference based then gameplay changing based, you get some different looking stuff and some factions have better stats towards items that there faction is advertised to be.you cannot log into this game as an experienced fps player and expect to go 40/5 score's like you might in cod or other related games, this game is about teamplay and stratergy, they're 6 different unit types all of which can counter or push or '' sneak '' the enemy to help your team/group/unit/outfit (clan)/faction take an objective.i still don't fully understand the game which is a surprise since i'm one of those kind of 40/5 players when it comes to fps games on the pc, however this isn't a game where you call people noob or get godly scores, infact most people don't get good scores, the game says you can die a hundred different ways and it's practically true, the game is about the real-war vibe, soldiers attacking objectives, dying over and over until air and tank support finally take over.sound: 9/10 - very realistic and immersive, makes you feel like you're in an actual war with the lights off :pgameplay: 10/10 - can feel unfair at times, but the over-all goal and experienced is more then achieved by the game.combat: 8/10 - again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalanced, luck can help as-well as group play.air combat: - 11/10 - so realistic and responsive, requires a lot of learning and practice to dominate.tanks/etc - 9/10 very realistic but can't be effectively fired using third person, shutting you down from your surroundingpay2win? - this game is free to play, some guns are  cash only but a lot of guns are in-game credits, you will find yourself somewhat grinding here, i was only able to unlock some gun attatchments and upgrades after 16 hours of gameplay, however the '' beginner '' guns are very good, they're not made crap to force you into buying, you could happily and easily use all the beginner items forever and be a good player, however i feel some cash guns do offer advantages but it's strange, the pace at which someone can die is never changed by the gun, some guns just assist the person, meaning if you're a good fps player it won't matter, if you're a new fps player or a bad one, you will often find yourself over-powered by cash users, over-all not anywhere close to p2w.- ps, the sniper unit can cloak small vehicles and fire from them whilst remaining cloaked, sniper units can also use some rifles, being stealthed with a rifle for me is a broken aspect of this game and one i do not enjoy or support.- sniping, it's nothing like call of duty or other fps games so if you're a quickscoping fanboy don't bother with this game, sniping is very realistic, you have to aim where your opponent will be, bullet travel time and distance vastly affects your aim, also most beginner snipers do not one shot unless headshot, but do lot's of high damage, which is how it should be, like air combat, sniping actually requires practice.over-all rating: 9/10 - completely free to play, no hackers that are overkilling the game, lots of stratergy, groups and action, not pay2win, addictive and balanced, feels like cod + battlefield, best of both worlds, with slightly less graphics compared to say battlefield, i'd say on max settings this makes any cod game look '' simular ''.graphics: i have a msi nvidia gtx 970 over-clocked at maximum overclock and i get 100-120 fps with very high settings in fights of 1-12 or 12-24, i get about 60-80 fps in fights of 24-48 and 60-70 in fights of 48-96 and 96+the textures of the game are somewhat '' ugly '' compared to other games, but this is often misunderstood as a bad thing, you have to load about 30-400 players in one somewhat small objective area at one given time, including the sky, the tanks and turrets, mines, the map itself, the rocks and map design and fillers including helicopters etc all moving at once, i feel the textures are bad for a reason, the game is unplayable on any standard/none gaming gpu, (amd/nvidia) is required at atleast about 70+ per gpu (2 gpu's) or 200+ for one gpu to run the game at an eye pleasing level.",1

14851,"my how far this game has fallen.i've been into this game since pretty damn near the beginning. back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. that sense of yeah, i built that when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.those days are long since past.the tiering system is gone entirely, and it is so easy to level up, that when i started the game after it was first changed. i jumped from 55 to 100 instantly, and i heard you could jump from even further back than that. the game's menus are so clunky now and they're hard to navigate... i still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. the colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. oh, no more tech points? there goes the fun in unlocking things too.the community robot factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. also, how much are these weapons?! ten million rp for a single top-power weapon? get stuffed i ain't payin' that i only get like 50-100k per battle!!!medic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. if you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. what a load of and the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.i really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. that was actually really fun and it was balanced too. guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.worst of all, the game crashes a lot more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, see ya no reward for you we just wanna waste your time bye! i swear the amount of times i heard a player has disconnected in one match was frightening, just before i crashed myself.i remember the days when i used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. complex, in the sense that all those cube variations; inner slope, edge slope, what? what are these for?at least they refunded all those new garage payments i made so now i have thousands upon thousands of free gc. so there's that at least.update time:so, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. fine, that's alright, it's a good start. what isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of rp whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. to quote, our intent was to help boost the rp income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable.so now what? now there is zero incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of rp just for participation. this just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game... if you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. if you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will earn that reward. but no, everyone gets similar amounts now. it's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day robin hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical wage-gap that no-one can prove exists. there's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so goddamn expensive. even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?well, at least they tried. they killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. i know some of you will call this nitpicking but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...update again:ok. they reverted the reward changes. i take back all that i said before. good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. let's see where the future takes the game now. they still have a bit to fix.",0

8180,"this is a d&d mmo loosely based on 4.0 rules in neverwinter's settings ( forgotten realms). i have been playing this since open beta and i am still playing it today. the art and graphics are nice, but i do not like the lack of noticable changes in character creation (most of the characters, of the same race, look very similar to eachother). i would not say this is a complete game, there are plenty of things they need to add and things they are working on. there are plenty of races to choose from, all but two are free (but who wants to play a moon elf or a menzo renegade, when you have regular drows?!).there are 6 classes with more in the works. you play how you want to play, choose what skills and gear you want to use for your character.for me, it is hard to talk about class balances because of what the classes were made to do. hunter ranger had recently been released and i haven't read, or played, much of them. though, when you look at the other characters, they have very specific roles (for most of them anyways). wizards have a lot of aoes and crowd controls, guardian fighters are tanks, clerics are healers and can even off tank is spec/geared properly. rogues are pure damage, but are very squishy, and the same thing with great-weapons fighter (thought i feel they are lacking in damage, but mine is very low level). i also don't pvp, so that is another reason why i can't really talk about the balances. i have done plenty of dungeons/skirmishes and have a varity of classes certainly helped out.it is a linear game, simply one quest/a group of quests after the next. you do get daily rewards, once you are level 10 or so, but can loose your weekly coins if you skipped a day (you get two coins a day: one type of coin you keep until you spend it, the other coin will stack up to 7 and is the one that will disappear if you skip a day). i would say give the game a try to, at least, level 15. at that level the foundry will open up to you. you will be able to make your own dungeons, or play dungeons that other players have made. the foundry gives you all the tools you need to get in for something very simple and later something more complexed.i have never felt the -need- to buy anything, but i have put money into this game. i don't care to have a faster mount since this is not an open world game. i don't mind making a few more trips to the vendor to clear up bag space, it's not really that different from other mmos. there is one pack where you can buy gear (which i don't really approve of), but other than that the gear in the zenn store (cash shop) has no stats and it's only there to make your character look pretty. i can't really say i like any of the companions in the zenn store, i simply use the companion you get for free or one i got during an in-game event. i am not happy about only having two free character slots, but enjoyed the game enough and didn't mind spending the money for more character slots. besides, anything that can be bought in the zenn store could also be bought with the in-game astral diamonds. saving up those diamonds can take awhile, even more so if you do not play that often, but it can be done.i would give this game a 8/10. there are plenty of things they need to work on: class balance, more content, playable classes, and so on. the graphics are nice and the game play is fun. i do not have a level capped character, but i am not really have a hard time leveling. i would say i have over 400 hours into the game, i stopped running raptr so i'm not sure how much i really spent playing this game. am i pressured into buying anything? sure, but it is only character slots or vanity gear. that wedding dress would be all kinds of cute on my wood elf! i am also addicted to making new characters, and what?!so, give it a try and see how you like/dislike it! also, if you are experiencing glitches or lag i suggest going to the neverwinter site and downloading it from there.",1

1104,"i waited til the game went free to play because of how much heat it's gotten over a certain clan.it's pretty fun and coming off world of tanks and warthunder, the grinding to unlock new ships as well as earning exp isn't as harsh as it is in wot, plus i actually enjoy being able to respawn in the same game. i don't really like lts type games. plus with a more moba type of format it's been pretty easy for me to adapt to it since i play a metric ton of smite. the queue times aren't bad either, only took a couple seconds to enter a game when it says that the average queue time is 3 minutes or so and at the time only a handful of players were online (430).i only played two games so far and i can already tell that some ships aren't exactly in a good spot. the conquest mode is faily easy to understand and i like how the map is layed out and is pretty much reminiscent of the standard 5v5 moba maps. the main reason i wanted to play this game was for the space combat and being able to use these massive ships, that part hasn't disappointed. i'm going to give it a positive review for now. it also being free to play helps it since it doesn't really offer much and only has the one mode to play. whether it was worth $9.99 when it was still early access i wouldn't know.",1

4317,"its a fun addicting shorter version of yu-gi-oh tcg. you can play this game without spending a penny. but if you ever want to get to the highest rank of king of games in the rank ladder it is possible without spending money; however, it will take a lot of time and luck with the rng to pull cards necessary to be competitive. the game overall is fun since you can mess around with friends or play solo just afking while auto-dueling bots to level up your characters and gather materials to access the duel gate or card trader shop. this game revolves around gems though to get new packs, accessories, and structure decks; these gems can be obtained from leveling up, events, dueling in rank, or spending money on deals in the shop. but, recently konami has made it harder to get gems like in the past with less gems being given in events and rank as well as changing the amount of packs in the new mini-boxes from 80 to 120, which makes it harder to obtain multiple copies of cards when resetting the mini-box. they also added awhile back the first structure deck only obtainable with money only not gems, so there are stuff locked behind the paywall. so, with each new box and mini-box release there are always meta defining decks along with them and its getting hard to keep up as a free-to-play player or mildy spend few cash player; so you have to save and spend gems wisely on cards you want or competitive boxes. overall if you want to reminiscent of playing yu-gi-oh like in one's childhood or play card game for fun this is a good game, but if you want to be competitive without spending money on this game from the start, it will be challenging to gather necessary cards for meta deck; unless you save up in a short period gems to get 1 meta deck made.",1

1715,"one of my favorite games in my library. my play time reflects how much time i have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the new york sunway. by the way, i love subway sandwiches. i eat a blt without the t almost every week. bacon is the most delicious meat. lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. you can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. unless of course you use your hands. or your mouth. but lettuce cups are pretty delicious. so imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. if potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. speaking of wet tables, if you put water on tables, it gets wet. not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. what is 6x6? its like 64 or something. which is like 10 if you add them all together. what does that mean? i am not sure. math is hard. unlike dota2. which is a great game. especially as a carry.actually i never played carry before. it seems like a pretty easy job though.just kill things until you win the game. that is a pretty simple job description. unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. i mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? it is more like a forest than a jungle. i mean jungles have lions and stuff right? forests have angry bears. i am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. horses aren't jungle creatures i think. they sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. i haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but i bet they are forest creatures as well too. so jungle should really be called forest.mid is a pretty self explanatory position. its the middle of the map lane. like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. or she. there are female heroes as well. are they called heroines? well i wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. that would be sexist. i mean playing lina is pretty addicting though. fire .its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. thats what lina is. which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. x and y are pretty popular with my friends, so i wamt a 3ds. those things cost money though, but i head i can trade my items for cash. that sounds pretty amazing. earning money while palying games, its like the american dream for people who don't want actual jobs. not that i have a job yet. all i do is stay home and read manga. which is pronounced mane gah, like mango but with an a. i sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaa.so offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. so the dangerous lane as they would call it. it isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. its like chinese vampires and running water. i don't think they can cross running water. many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. one flush of the toilet and the go poof. or do they? i actually know nothing about chinese vampires. i only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. it was the twilight saga. i really preferred the jacob to the other guy though. i was pretty upset when bella made the wrong choice. i mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. yuck!so support is the last job you can play. not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. he can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. why wouldn't i want another donkey instead of one flying one? i am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. i mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? it could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. but donkeys are pretty cute. so keep them on the ground. if donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic. so that is dota. its a pretty good game. but it has some problems too. after all, even blt's have t's. here are the digusting parts of the blt. games take a while to finish. so if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. a game of dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. like i am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of dota. i mean look at my avatar. that is my face for like the first 5 minutes of dota before my legs fall asleep and i start getting cramps. it also has too many different heroes. i think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. it would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. it is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. you are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. it would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. some game modes take forever. like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. sometimes i want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and i accidentally ban mr. thunder or the masked electric emo. then team thunder is ruined. i can understand why bans could be good though. cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. he uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. what is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. the biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. its like worse than dynasty warriors when it comes to story. i could use a few cutscenes telling me why i am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. at least there was a reason in dynasty warriors 7 about why i am fighting guan yu with my hated enemies the filthy wu. were those filthy wu actually even men? the way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. so i think i will give the game a 1/10/14. its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. i understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when i team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. a 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. people play like men instead of filthy wu women. but ali, why the 14 and not a 17? because the game has that huge tomato. and i hate tomatoes. i love blt's without the t. bl is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary t. i would have bl everyday if i could afford it, but i have no job and spend all my time reading manga.",1

5726,"dcs world is a great hardcore combat flight sim with a crazy amount of detail and i love it for that but something about the game doesn't feel the same as il-2 1946 or strike fighters 2. i think it comes down to a few things with me. 1: content is lacking. compaired to il-2 and sf2 the game feels a little barebones with its selection of aircraft. yes the detail is much higher in dcs but i would rather see eagle dynamics come out with more playable aircraft if it means dropping the detail to that of fc3.2: no middle ground. its full sim or nothing in dcs and thats fine but tbh i like the way il-2 and sf2 handle sims and having the option just to set things as easy or as hard as i want. (sometimes i just want to blow s*** up) without going though the hassel. 3: mod support. this leads back to the issue of not having a wide selection of aircraft in dcs and its far from having any type of mod library that gets close to il-2 or sf24: price of dlc. now i'm no stranger to paying for dlc on a simulator (god knows i spent a lot in train simulator) but thats the thing. for me it comes down to why pay when i can get a mod for sf2? if they lowered the cost i wouldn't mind picking put more then what i have but at $50 i find it hard to justify getting one.dcs world is a great sim, but is it on my favorites list? no, it doesn't have the aircraft i like and it doesn't give me the same joy and gameplay experience that i look for in a sim. 7/10",1

4573,"i've tried lol, dota and a few other moba's, but i just couldn't get into the isometric click-fest. after having played the beta i gave smite another shot when it launched 1,5 years ago and i never looked back. more than a 1000 hrs later i'm still playing every single day.it will take you some time and practice to get used to it all, but it's more accessible compared to other moba's due to it having less items and being able to turn on auto-buy/level. positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming, timing, communication and synergy making it hard to master. the game is based on mythology from 7 different pantheons and the 69 gods (at the time of writing) all have lore related directed taunts, which adds a lot of humour to the mix. 5 different classes, 8 game-modes on 5 different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone.regular updates and patches keep the game fresh. with plenty of free gems events and sales you won't need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you don't want to. (i have accumulated 1000s of gems and free stuff in my playtime) being the 3rd biggest moba with 2nd largest tournament prizepools in e-sports history i think i can safely say hi-rez finally hit the right spot with this game. the only negative things i can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky, which isn't too big of a deal if you don't play ranked leagues. as with any online game you get a few toxic players every now and then, but they can easily be muted or ignored and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your matches. furthermore i can reccommend playing/queueing with friends. once you get used to the 3rd person and aiming, turn off auto-buy/level and use sites like tiermonster.com for item builds. the bots in co-op game-modes are horribly bad, get into pvp as soon as possible. read some guides and watch streams to improve your game. if you enjoy the game get the ultimate god pack (unlocks all gods+future gods) it's the best deal in moba games.

6709,"waste of 15.3 hours, in current state. would not recommend.things wrong with game:- unbalanced gameplay between teams. us very underpowerd some of the worst guns in the game (especialy at the begining. be better off beating someone to death with a shovel and then taking their gun.- poor melee mechanics and hit detection. (i understand that hit mechanics may be difficult to impliment properly but this is the worst i have seen melee in a game.)- very poor upgrade system due to everything needing upkeep and being absurdly expensive to buy with in game cash.- you will strain your eyes trying to see what pixels you are looking at through your sights. only to be killed 3 sec after you figure out what it is, by someone who is more than likely using a magnifying glass taped over his screen.- good luck when you get to the level where you can start fighting tanks you will struggle to go anywhere as tank damaging explosives are quite rare on 90% of the maps.- most annoying thing is that death is near instant yet it will take you 1 min to get back to the fight. and thats if you have a jeep. if you are walking you might as well leave the fight then, because you finally get back to the fight only to die 2 seconds in and have to do it all over again.- lastly the time it takes games to finish. some games i have been in have lasted over an hour... of course not after waiting 10 min for the game to find a match for you. a solid 3 hrs of the 15 ive played have been sitting at my computer playing on my phone while waiting for the next open spot in a game.things i would do to fix the issue:- while the slight sight sway on the guns is more realistic, reduce it.- slightly increase zoom on iron sights. small difference but it can help reduce frustration by a good amount for new players.- make melee do more damage to counter the lack of hitting or increase the range that melee can hit.- add more rocket boxes but reduce their per shot damage and blast radius.- reduce spawn time for spawning at vehicles... 30 seconds+ is too long.- allow rewards at a reduced rate for people who leave early. most people do not have the time to sit through such long games. - remove upkeep required on guns/equipment or lower the price of buying new equip/characters.i hope this review could be of some use. as for me, i will not be comming back to the game. as of posting this the game has been uninstalled. i do however not want your game to fail. i do understand the amount of work put into games like this. i also know that you have to make money while doing it, so i understand why everything is so pricy. face it, its new players that spend the most money not the vets, if no new players play the game more then 1 time then you wont make any money at all. its a fine line and im sorry but i think you are currently on the wrong side.",0

4790,"i have played this gem of a game a total of 287 hours before it was available on steam and i could start playing it on my steam account.i started playing smite in open beta. i even had a closed beta key, but stupid me didn't start playing smite back then because the premise of a moba sounded boring. i had no idea. well, smite could be called the non-boring moba.this is a full action game you play in 3rd person, so you can enjoy the beautiful levels and the even more beautiful ability effects from a decent angle of view. even better is you can enjoy the look of the gods and their many awesome skins from up close.the gameplay doesn't lack either. once you know how to upgrade abilities and when to purchase which item, casual play (which i prefer, but smite has a huge competitive scene with leagues etc if you prefer that) is a lot of fun and will entertain you for many hours, especially because you can choose from many different gods to play, as well as a good selection of different game modes.gods? yes, you play gods. this game doesn't feature unknown fantasy characters with a lame backstory, instead you play one of currently (january 2016) 73 gods (and some mythical demons and monsters), like thor, freya, athena, ares, isis, osiris, hercules, mercury, kali, rama, kukulkan, chaac, sun wukong, chang'e and, recently (january 2016) introduced, amaterasu as first goddess of the japanese pantheon.it is likely that more pantheons will be added in the future.the fact that you are an actual god in a battle for the heavens makes this game feel more epic than other mobas, which is supported by the scenery, items and music in the game.this is a free to play game which has an acceptable in-game economy. there is no pay to win at all in this game, everything you buy for real money is cosmetic, from avatars, skins, voice packs to music or announcer packs. all gods can be unlocked by playing other gods (you get a selection of gods for free when starting the game), and many skins and other items can be unlocked by playing as well.the only thing you could say against smite is that a game can swing to one side a little too quickly. however, even in the smite world championship we have seen interesting turns in a game, so the imbalance is perfectly acceptable.i can recommend this game even to people who think mobas are boring. you will probably be disabused of this notion like me.",1

9908,"xd here with a brief review of the game elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes adventuring socializing, talking and trading items. also, who don't mind spending a few dollars on customising and upgrading the character or characters they plan on using later on in the game. this game is a side strolling 3d beat em up japanese anime game with real-time fighting doing combo combinations while using spells and magic moves and skills in your repithior to defeat your enermies. you can also use skill points to unlock new skills and new moves as you progess through the game and get stronger meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different ways and set different skill moves to manipulate his/her character the way they see fit. each character has his/her storyline of why they are here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you won't put down when get heads and tails of things :). i just a few months ago tried the game myself and today still play it because there are so many things in the game that you can do and new things and great deals and oppertunities get added to the game on a regular basis. plus you can hang out in this game with your friends form parties and/or groups together talk, trade, socialize in real-time go in dungeons together or solo talk and stratigize while fighting with your friends in real-time. or if you got to go or stop playing for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group/party at anytime with the push of a button on your character's personal social option. plus they start you off with ten resurrection stones and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game. at the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character's storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game. if it turns out that you don't like that character you could make up to four characters or four of the same characters in anyway you see fit. from the clothes they wear to the way they fight, you controll it all. or you could chose the character you don't want any more and press delete the game would then ask you: are you sure you want to delete the character? click yes and the character will be deleted no and the character will be spared. in my opinion, this game is one of the best games i have ever played and am in it for the long-hall/run they people in this game will get tired of seeing me and say oh there gos xd again. also, after customising your character putting your moves together and learn your skills you can challege your friends and other people online in tournaments that gives you prises, sparring sessions and practice sessions for fun and to develope your realtime fighting skills that you can level up by appling sp/skillpoints that you get when you level up from beating dungeons. there are different areas to too each with different materials you need to craft new weapons, amor and clothes, you will find out more about this in the game. anyways, that's some of the basic things you can do in this game if interested you should give i a try and might end up liking the game more than me. :) from xd big fan of elsword",1

16432,"donald j. trump inauguration speechevery four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. they have been magnificent, thank you.todays ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another  but we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you, the people.for too long a small group in our nations capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.their victories have not been your victories. their triumphs have not been your triumphs. and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. it belongs to you. it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america.this is your day.this is your celebration.and this  the united states of america  is your country.what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.january 20 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. everyone is listening to you now.you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement  the likes of which the world has never seen before.americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.these are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists.mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.we are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.this american carnage stops right here and stops right now.we are one nation and their pain is our pain; their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. we share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans. for many decades, weve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our own military.we've defended other nations borders while refusing to defend our own.and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while americas infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.we've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. one by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of american workers that were left behind.the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power  from this day forward a new vision will govern our land  from this day forward it's going to be only america first  america first!every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families.we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. i will fight for you with every breath in my body and i will never ever let you down.america will start winning again; winning like never before.we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.we will build new roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.we will get our people off of welfare and back to work  rebuilding our country with american hands and american labour.we will follow two simple rules  buy american and hire american.we will seek friendship good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.we do not seek to impose our way of live on anyone but, rather, to let it shine as an example. we will shine for everyone to follow.we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilised world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america. and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice.the bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when gods people live together in unity. we must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity.when america is united, america is totally unstoppable.there should be no fear: we are protected and we will always be protected. we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. and most importantly we will be protected by god.finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. in america we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.the time for empty talk is over; now arrives the hour of action.do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america. we will not fail; our country will thrive and prosper again. we stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.a new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions. its time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.so to all americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our american destiny.together we will make america strong again; we will make america wealthy again; we will make america proud again; we will make america safe again; and yes  together we will make america great again.thank you.god bless you.and god bless america.",1

5398,"this is review on this really nice game. now.. where do i start.. alright, this game is about tanks (obviously) and is highly recommended to people who are into tanks, or just like competitive games. i absolutely adore this game for numerous of reasons, one of them is how simple and great this game is. you just set your region, log in (through steam preferably), do the tutorial and after just enjoy the battles as you slowly progress and upgrade your tank. this game is really nice visually, and it also supports really low specs such as my laptop's! here are the proper cons and pros to avoid confusion:pros:-really simple and fun-supports nearly any system-its settings allow you to run it on a potato-good competitive gamecons:-mostly the community, i've met a bit of ragers and children, but only a bit-a bit difficult to start with a weak tank compared to all the strong ones.that's basically all pros i could find. download it now! no credit card, no phone number, no bulls**t.",1

7004,"overall pretty good game for a card game, similar to hearthstone but based off the elder scrolls world. so if you know that world better than wow, this might be the game for you. the pve side of it is pretty good as well, provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you dont want to, thanks to the pve arena.biggest downfall which i very dislike, you cant create the cards that are in special bundles. so of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game. the reason i want to highlight this out is because they have a description for the madhouse bundle stating: we've added some cards thatll really help balance out certain decks and help the game. but you have to pay $10 just to get a bundle of cards.regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help maintane a competive advantage with exclusive/op cards, the games fun in its simple form. also im sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said op cards. i give the game total a 6/10 due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap. (cuz revenue is always better than player experience, we all know how the business world works). if your ok with spending money on digital cards, the game deserves 8/10 for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games.this last paragraph is edited: as necrophagist pointed out, u can use your ingame gold to purchase said content above. which is a good alternative, it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content. so i've decided to change the total rating to 7/10 due to that alternative.",1

4192,"if you played and/or play the normal yu-gi-oh card game, i do not recommend this. its a sad immitation. don't get me wrong its oddly enjoyable, i mean i put in 6 hours into it, and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then 30 minutes, but its not something i can take seriously.cons:first, they cut the game in half, which means, half the deck size, half the hp, half the time, and half the cards on the field. biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that, so that means you have cards the ask for 5000 hp and combo cards like exodia that are useless.the game forces you through a progression system, that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction. i understand explaining a game to someone, but anything bellow level 40 is no challenge at all, and thats with a halfdeck. to give example of how bad it is, level 20 and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss, and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long. the ai is super simple. now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage 6 to even play against players. just to clarify what i mean by no challenge, is the enemy does not place spell or trap, and nothing above crappy regular 3 stars, which can be easily out done with one of your first cards.last thing i have to say, is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical chinese knockoff, they put in a attempt, tried to cut corners, and it turned out likepros(yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it):matches are fast, so you can enjoy a few during a break.its more portable, so yu-gi-oh on the go.less money to get a insane amount of cards.good way to try new cards, and card combos.they implement a auto-duel feature, making the boring duels shorter, more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck.voice actors from the anime.",0

8888,"first things first:the game is controversial. dont get fooled by my playtime. combined with my time using the soe launcher my gametime goes into multiple thousands of hours so here my advise.if u wanna go alone and just grind guns, stay away from it. you will find the grind tedious, you will be outgunned by people who are worse than you, but win because they gang up on you.im not saying u cant have fun in the game going solo from time to time. i do so myself.the actual joy comes in when you become part of a team. doesnt matter if you are an elitist in your small squad of energdrinking, doritoeating memelords or you are being a small part of a way bigger machine playing continent wide king of the hill. while doing so the certs u need for all of your upgrade will come along the way.actual review:overview:we have here an mmofps, in which u can play one of three factions (or all of them) that emphasives the management of population and the right form of deployment. in a nutshell, when u are bringing 12 guys deployed as light infantry and you are going against 48 players going at you combined arms style, you are in for a rough ride and should question the sanity of your squadlead.when two armies are managed properly and are going at each other. then you are in for an experience that is unrivaled across all games im aware of.the factions you can play are supposed to be asymetricly balanaced, but in reality the only realy difference are the gunsounds with a different gimmick here and there. to make a perfectly inaccurate statement. nc: hits hard, fires slow. tr: has big magazines. vs: has fast reload speed and no bullet drop (the bullet drop isnt so handy though)graphics and optimization:the graphics aged well. the game is from 2012 and on ultrasettings u will get some cool visuals. however the optimization is far from perfect, so u need a decent rig to able to play the game on low settings. its recommended for all lowend rigs to completely turn of shadow and light effects.gunplay:this game uses clientside. if you dont know what that means pls use google before you read on. the ttk when playing infantry vs. infantry is pretty high (6-8 hits). there are a lot of shiny things u can use to upgrade you class, but they are not of any use if u dont understand clientside. people camping in corners will be in a disadvantage in this game. also because of the high ttk, infantry combat is relatively close quarterish compared with other games.vehiclegameplay:i wont go into ground vehicles here since, well everyone knows what they can expect from them. there are tanks, armoured trooptransports and what have ya. not that different from what already exists irl.however the airgame is different from u might have experience in other games. the flying vehicles in the game all kind of act like attack helicopters. this is due to the ability to hover that all airvehicle have. this turns dogfights into helicopter battles where the combatants usually face each other instead of getting on the six of one another. if u wanna be more than cannonfodder in the air you also need lots of practice since the more advanced manouvers are not really intuitive and need practice. there are some good vids on youtube for that.psw? :there is nothing currently avaiable in the game that cant be earned through just playing the game. however camos and other cosmetics are only dropped when u win an alert and its a random drop.so if u really wanna have a certain shiny thing on your armor u might help out your grandpa in the garden and invest the moneys u get there in shinys.all other things can be aquired by certification points that u get every 250 xp points or so. as stated above if you are just playing this game for the grind, while also going solo, u will have a hard time to aquire the certs u want to unlock the much needed upgrades on you utility slots.general advise: the basic guns u get to start with are the most versatile. investing your first certs in the actual class abilites and slots will upgrade your char more than a 1k cert gun that u just bought because some good players use it.there are implants in the game that can be bought in lootboxes, with certs or with real cash. i think the mechanic is problematic but the implants are not. these implants give you tiny or nice to have gimmics that improve the qulity of life but dont make you inherently stronger. you can have the best implants in the game. when you dont know how to clientside u still get rekt.it is worth noting here, that if the main continent (the one with most population) often has a queue to get into if u play the faction with most population. if u aquire membership (also give a bit more xp) u will be treated with priority.i cant give definitive answer here since i guess that the whole psw needs more definition. i can tolerate it.",1

140,so a friend of mine already finished the game and i iam just to scared to play it but i still played a bit but anyways you when playing the game will face and endless repetitive room cycle whith no return.gameplay:actually not bad symple controls good spoopy atmosphere and it kinda as a scp containment breach vibe to it.story (some spoilers): i havent got most of it but for what i got is that spooky (the ghost in the beginning) is trying to make an army of monsters aka specimens wich she created and ghosts which are the ppl that she killed with the monsters just so she can take over the world and make ppl stop calling her cute.overall: preety good game give it a try if you aren to spooked by eye bussines (i know i am) and try to get to the end (there are 2 btw). tip: if you want to understand the story read everything.,1

9070,"still my favorite competitive shooter ever. this is all out war, seriously. the openess of the maps and the base setups create situations you will never experience in single map deathmatch games no matter how many people you pack in them. lines of troops, tanks, airships punching through an enemy line and rushing the next base in a huge wave of chaos is something like i have never experienced before in a game. it really feels like sometimes i am on a total war battlefield with how the action takes place on this grander scale. you can feel it when you and your friends are making a difference busting that choke point, and suddenly the tide turns and theres that rush of boom, move out soldiers! as you get to know the maps and how the bases are tied together, you will understand this more. there is a particular area of a map where two bases can see each other with a vast stretch of open land between them. i have been part of tides trying to wave across this field to the next base with utter chaos all over, with gunfire flying from each base and tanks in there positions on either side, hundreds of troops battling out in between hiding behind rocks holding the line. amazing. in another area though you may have to fight your way up a hill, creating new situations and different strategies. the maps are varied and the areas have many ways to approach and take on a situation. you can go from these extremes down to going after that base thats available for the taking, but people are not looking at much, creating a smaller deathmatch like situation that can suddenly grow as people see the opening and push it. this is truly a massive scale game when it comes to these crazy moments, but there is alot of depth to the classes and vehicles as well. many upgrades and weapons to get, and alot can be done earning the in game certificates, the free to play model is done very well. much like a good free to play, you will want to spend the money at some point, but you have plenty to do before, and do not feel forced into it. this game can be harsh, because due to its very chaotic and open nature, you will die alot. you as a single player will never dominate anything or anyone for a length of time, its the teamwork that counts here. to me in this game repairing a sunderer is totally as good as a kill, because anything you can do to help your teamates will help you win that base. this makes support classes really stand out in this game, but all classes really have a place in the action, with each able to make special contributions to whats going on in the battlefield. the same goes for the vehicles, from the sunderer mobile spawn point and nasty tanks, to troop dropping airships and fast agile dogfighters, this is a game not to be missed!this game easily makes my top 10 list of games to play before you die.10/10",1
14832,"wall of text inbound:great game. amazing game. i love this game to pieces. at least i used to. the game was awesome up until recently. than crates arrived. actually i shouldn't blame one update i suppose. if i were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, i'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf. this feature, which i'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. the crf allowed for the rapid deployment of op bots or rather exploitative builds. i'm going to use the tesseract as an example. while not a huge issue on its own, it is the way freejam went about resolving this issue that made matters worse. to any veteran of the game that had some knowledge of the problem, the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. a more complex fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. sadly, freejam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1,but 3 (now 2, but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. while the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. this isn't a review whining about badly balanced aa though, so onto the next nail. shortly after this fiasco, fj introduced epic loot. a system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins 9 times out of 10. instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to test their luck with crates. crates that logically fail to reward a player. common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. this makes sense. the crates fj has forced upon us do not follow such logic. high tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. this is ing stupid, period. there's also the complaint regarding the premium row flaunting items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. moving on to the big one. a lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. if every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. as simple as this problem is, it is so bad in fj's case. the simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customers to vent. why? no devs will respond, with exception of drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :3). the devs that have a proper power over the games development use twitter instead of their own forums. it's dumb. anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, i'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. so tl;dr:pros:1. builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. 2. not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. cons:1. devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised 2. balance weapons? what are those? 3. exploit/meta builds everywhere. creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to fj. 4. hope you enjoy gambling. ===i really like this game. but sadly, i can't recommend it to anyone because for 1. you're not rewarded for and the devs don't seem to intent on fixing the issues.",0

9128,"this is most likely going to be one of the most negative recommendations you will ever read, but i tend to criticize heavily the things i enjoy and despite my criticisms i do enjoy planetside 2, as you may have guess with the amount of hours logged. but this game has serious issues bugging it and they will ensure the demise of this game sooner before later, as a shooter it is fun but as an mmo it will not be able to sustain itself much longer. and its up to you to determine if putting up with these issues is worth the rush of being in massive scale battles that no other game is capable of. the first issue i have with the game is when many of the games individual elements put together it seems to fall apart. its like each mechanic of gameplay was designed in a different room with no knowledge of what the final product was supposed to even look like. either that or the development team was so intent on copying popular shooters that focus on small 4-64 player battles they gave no thought what so ever to how much of an impact it would have with hundreds of players. one example of this is that the developers gave people the ability to plant ammo packs without restraint, giving infinite ammo and unlimited healing (seriously you can revive people in less time than it takes to kill them). the best strategy for winning an evenly matched fight is to simply bore the enemy until they give up and leave. with unlimited healing and ammo on both sides many battles result in a standstill with my squad leader saying something along the lines of lets go someplace else. another flaw of planetside 2 is the level design. the bases look good aesthetically but function poorly. i think the developers are slowly becoming aware of this is constant changes are being made, however i think if you took the words cram as many people as you can into a choke point and copy pasted it across 10 pages you would have the entire design document. this choke point obsession combined with the mechanics of infinite healing/ammo creates the bore the enemy into submission battles. you either have the population at the base to steamroll it, or you have the population to get steamrolled. if you and your enemies have even remotely even forces chances are you just shoot at each other until someone falls asleep at the keyboard. if you are defending a base you can always go after the mobile spawn points, but since those are in infinite supply as well they can always bring more. with lackluster stage design and small scale shooter mechanics pretending they can work in an mmo are evidence of the chief issue of planetside 2; that many of its ideas just dont work well together. as long as it continues to function with these ideas it will be nothing but a source of constant issues. the other issue i will address is the system of economics. basic economics tell us that when there is an abundance of something it has no value. it is because of this reason many people consider planetside 2s predecessor to be superior. in the original planetside not everyone could do everything, therefore what you chose to do had value because not everyone would be capable of it. if you decided to drive a tank, it was meaningful because not everyone could. as a result tanks were able to shake up the gameplay, add variety to the battlefield and make things interesting. in planetside 2 the developers gave everyone the ability to drive a tank and now they are worthless, instagibable by practically anyone (including medics). it is because everyone has access to everything that the gameplay gets boiled down into a gray homogenous amoeba like mass labeled zerg, anything that is not zerg will be consumed and nerfed down until it is. this cripples the gameplay significantly. any attempt to introduce anything new and interesting will be passed through the consideration that everyone will be doing it and therefore it must be absorbed as part of the zergy mass, and offer no real variety to that mass. most recently they introduced a few new weapons for the liberator bomber, and to be honest, they suck. and they must suck, because if they were actually any good everyone would be using them and nothing else. essentially this system only backs the developers into a corner of delivering nothing but piles of mediocrity. the final issue to bring up is the grind. if you give an assault rifle to a private 1st class and have him ordered to shoot a hole in the wall, he will shoot a hole in the wall. if you then give that weapon to a staff sergeant and have him ordered to shoot a hole in the wall, he will shoot a hole in the wall. the hole will not be any deeper, the weapon will not be more powerful nor will his armor protect him anymore, a magic pixie does not come along and sprinkle its dust on your weapons and armor because you advance in rank. a good competitive shooter at its core is a game that relies on skill, strategy, tactics and teamwork. magic pixie dust to make weapons and armor more powerful in the hands of higher ranked people betrays these very concepts. it has been the chief failing behind many games (apb, brink, huxley, and im sure you can name a few others). and while planetside 2 tries to avoid magic pixie dust, it fails. many times people had my heavy assault dead to rights with solid out maneuvering, but because i put a lot of magic pixie dust on my shield and armor they stand no chance no matter how skilled or strategic they are, and dont even get me started on how bad magic pixie dust determines the victor in vehicle combat. the grind always fails shooters. many modern shooters have a grind, and there is a reason they are often referred to as flavor of the month shooters. i have no idea why soe thought that flavor of the month shooter mechanics would work in an mmo that needs to be sustainable over years. this is another reason why many people consider the first planetside superior, because the developers understood this. a gauss rifle in the hands of a newbie was the same in the hands of a veteran, no magic pixie dust, just the players skill with the weapon. i believe the proof of this lies in steams wonderful statistics. there is a reason team fortress 2, and counterstrike in its many flavors retain more people over time than planetside 2 or any of the call of duty games, simply because they are not nearly as much the grind fest. for an mmo to succeed you need to establish long term success, not short term popularity. as i said before i enjoy planetside 2, but i dont see it lasting much longer. the way much of the gameplay doesnt seem to go hand in hand, the poor economic decision to give everything to everyone and the constant grinding just to hopefully someday stand on even ground (which most good shooters immediately start you out at) make it wear thin quickly. its like a mosh pit at a speed metal concert. its fun, its fast, its furious, and can be a blast at times. but when youre done there isnt a real driving incentive to go back to it anytime soon. if youre late getting into it youre going to get your butt kicked to the point you might just leave early, and you know anything new they add is just going to get lost in the moshing.",1

1475,"fractured space is a game of giant spaceships, stately and graceful motion, and ruthlessly low ttks coupled with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30m or more. it's a remarkable example of how you can take the moba archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only looks totally different and plays totally different, but actually builds on the good parts of the genre.many reviews for this game go into the strategic depth (they're right), the tactical depth (they're right) or the mechanical level of complexity (they're mostly right). the game plays well, for the most part, and can easily support thousands of hours of play. but i won't say much more on that.i would like to point out the community management for fractured space is top notch. the community managers know that having a coc and banning people based of it will draw a lot of fire on steam from trolls. but they've stuck to their guns. i have never seen cm's more proactive on banning racists, transphobes, homophobes and even misogynists! it's incredible, and you have to know it comes at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collectives of steam.even the game devs can get punished for bad behavior. while it's rare to see them cross the line, it has happened and the cms have not handed out special treatment.they do this while still being tolerant of the normal outbursts and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming communities. you can disagree with a dev and call them out on it, even in game or on the forums, and they will listen. they may not agree with you or act on what you say, but for such a well-policed community the actual level of debate is very spirited.that's something special and rare all on its own, and ecg deserves a lot of credit for this. it's a real accomplishment all on its own.finally, fractured space's deep gameplay is not marred by monetization mechanics. in general, ecg knows that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modifications and boosters (much like any f2p game). but there is no mechanical advantage afforded as of 09/2016 from any store option. it's a fair game, with a lot of depth. you can play it knowing that while enemies may be better than you, or more coordinated than you, they still have the same tools in their toolkit as you do. and they have stuck to their guns on that stance even though it has caused a lot of short-term problems for them.",1

3823,"the premier online hat simulator, 2007 edition. if you are reading this and have never played this game, please don't start now. tf2 is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top. it has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics. it has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade. it has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)tf2 is as much a social platform as it is a video game. it's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics. there's also an fps minigame which i hear is occasionally populated. unfortunately, with the meet your match update in the summer of 2016, valve removed the quickplay function from tf2, killing off all community servers not named skial. now the landscape consists of 24/7 2fort, harvest, hightower and turbine. it's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.with mym valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers. the casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be. it's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory 60 second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game. player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason. tf2 still has huge balance issues. sniper, a poor fit for the game in 2007, is insanely un-fun to fight against 11 years later. there are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. the class needs a fundamental rework to remove the insta-kill all classes from any range mechanic. scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels. since 2016, medic runs at scout speed with any medi-gun, making scout completely dominant in 6s competitive. heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion. core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all. since 2014, heavy's minigun starts at 50% of its base damage. spy is both up and op at the same time. baguette now runs at medic speed, and faster than scout when he pops the dead ringer. valve nerfed the ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, valve overdid it by a factor of 2). they have left the diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.as of this writing, the big 3 tf2 cheats (the l word, the n word, and the c word) are all undetected. hackers are rampant in valve's competitive and casual modes, and there's plenty on the few populated community servers as well. the hasn't been a major vac ban wave in tf2 for all of 2018.all of this would be problematic but possibly understandable if valve were a small company keeping their game alive. the company is worth nearly 20 billion dollars at this point. half of that is in gaben's back pocket. there's like 5 dudes who work on tf2 (valve has claimed up to 16 at one point) and while i am sure they are working hard, they're very understaffed.valve's flat structure was a dumb idea 20 years ago, but the company did manage to produce many gems for their first decade. for the last 10 years, the company has grown hugely and made so much money they don't even know what it means to give a . the company's internal structure actively works to the detriment of the customers.if you're still reading and you've actually played this game, you know what i'm talking about. i'll see you on doublecross later this evening.",1

9767,"it makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win. there is nothing in this game that you have to buy. there are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. i've been playing this game since back when there were only 4 classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. the items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. there are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier pve experience. the only thing that i can say is a usual must pay is the second b slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $8 other than that you don't have to buy anything, i've never expanded my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy. now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2d side scrolling with 3d elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. each character currently in the game has 3 jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. all and all the games pve is superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. now for the pvp, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. it comes in the form of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and a base race game mode. where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. the biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in pve where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. overall i believe that this is a great mmo that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.",1

1724,this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. the reason i choose dota over lol is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. i hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health lol. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.,1
14556,"if we were back in time around 2014-2015, i would recommend this game. now, it deserves to be un-recommended. as you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. i only started playing around mid-2014 and personally, i thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. i got the majority of my 116 hours of playtime in the first year since i got it. now, the game has just gone downhill. freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the random loot crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. before, you couldn't win a battle arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. now, there can be one or two enormous mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. their recent update with the random loot crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. also, what they call the best player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best k:d ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. this increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates. from the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a premium account for the game. in conclusion: robocraft was awesome. because freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not premium. now, robocraft is horrible. because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. this game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.---update: after months on end of ignoring the game, i forced myself to boot it up one more time just so i can see what's new and how the community has changed. now i would like to declare that robocraft has officially died. it's just not what it was before. everything is different, in a bad way. this is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money. rip robocraft!!---",0

3658,"team fortress 2 aka tf2 is a free to play, multiplayer, first person shooter (fps), and a hat (cosmetic) simulator. a very fun game. especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class.classes & teams: there're about 9 classes in the tf2: [offensive classes:] scout, soldier, pyro, [defensive classes:] demoman, heavy (weapons guy), engineer, [support classes:] medic, sniper and spy.each class has it's own strength and weakness. for example, spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you.tf2 has 2 teams: blu and red. they hate each other, and they attack each other. nothing interesting.maps (levels) & gamemodes:maps can be different (pretty obvious). but unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like i said before, each class has it's own weakness. for example, sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed. each map has it's own gamemode. here is a list of all official gamemodes:capture the flag (ctf)control points (cp)territorial control (tc)payload (pl)payload race (plr)king of the hill (koth)medieval modespecial delivery (sd)mann vs machine (mvm)robot destruction (rd)arena (arena)mannpowerand here is a list of unofficial gamemodes:highlander (tf2center.com)6v6 (tf2center.com)saxton hale mode or freak fortress (vsh)randomizerslender fortress (sl)prop hunt (ph)dodgeball zombie fortress surfing (surf)jail breakfortwarsand many more.hats/cosmetics: you don't need them to play a game. players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. most of them, spend about $500 on the game, only because of the hats. players also care about the qualities of the items. some qualities can be very expensive, so i don't suggest to spend money on crap. however, hats are not the only ones. players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins.if you really want to get hats, then i suggest you to read this guide: you want more hats, then i suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the tf2 trading community, and about trading itself. here is a guide: updates: there are 2 different kinds of tf2 updates: official updates and community created updates (they're official, too). what's the difference, you ask? well, it's pretty simple:official updates - are created by the main creator/company called valve. in their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that valve is going to add new hats, made by the community from the steam's workshop.community created updates - valve usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning valve doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (however, valve added community maps only in the beginning, when tf2 was still new and fresh. but now everything is different, because in nowadays tf2 became as a very popular game.) so like i said before, valve actually cares what community creates. so valve likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. but majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. and to be honest: it's normal. if you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called end of the line, and it was actually the most useless update in the tf2. it had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats. before an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called snowplow with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by valve. valve said, that the map is too confusing for new players. later, that sentence became as a meme, because other maps made by valve are more confusing, than a snowplow. anyways, let's move on:unbalanced gameplay & weapons: tf2 has 2 kinds of players: f2p (free to play) players (aka noobs) and p2p (premium to play) players (aka experienced players). imagine blu team full of noobs, and red team full of experienced players. is this a balanced match? heck no. reds would win every bloody match. however, in valve servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. here is a list current voting types:kick playerrestart the matchchange level/next levelscramble teamsdisable team autobalanceeternaween (allow halloween-restricted items for two hours. player must have an item to enable this voting choice.) so imagine again those 2 teams again: imagine, that you joined the blu team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. so you decide to vote to scramble teams. so what do you think what's going to happen? the voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun and because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting.now let's talk about weapons, shall we? nah, let's not, because valve finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. i could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. i will still save this title, just in case.the story: well there is a story in the tf2, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. you can only find it in the official tf2 comics. you can find comics in the official tf2 website, right here.[www.teamfortress.com]the community: the community was great, until tf2 became for free. right now, if you go to any official valve server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. i hope your ears doesn't explode. to be honest, tf2 community is still great. it depends where you live. usually, i really love to play with americans. i never loved to play with europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless. how cruel!what is a premium account? premium account means an upgraded account. in the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot. if you buy something from the mann. co store (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack. it's very important to have a premium account, because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you. i suggest you to buy a mann co. supply crate key. once you bought something from the mann co. store - don't use it again. use it only to buy keys. once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!)overall, my rating is 7 out of 10.remember: once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it.everything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things.also, i am very sorry if i was very rude or mad in this review. it's because sometimes, tf2 can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. if you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.have fun! ^.^",1

2357,"to start on a positive note, path of exile takes the diablo formula and expands on it in every single way possible. it has an incredibly complex crafting, leveling and gear progression system, which is growing and becoming more intricate with every single update and hasn't been matched by any other game in the genre to this date. the music is excellent, the environments are alluring and the lore is fascinating, but what brings the game down is a staggering amount of well documented technical issues that plague it, ranging from poor optimization to server stability. the servers simply cannot handle prime time, especially after the release of the new expansion. and since this is a free to play game, making server stability a priority is clearly not in the cards for the developers. it's completely understandable from a business standpoint; however the game is no longer playable for me and many other people in its current state. even if you were to overlook the incredibly poor optimization of its dated engine, the developers refuse to focus on stability issues, churning out new content and micro transactions, instead of fixing the game and making it accessible to a larger player base. the issue will become more prevalent in the future, as more and more players jump on the bandwagon with every new expansion.",0

1417,"updated 5th october 2017:be aware that you can also be suspended for no good reason because the devs don't want people to play the game other than in one single linear strategy. 1 week suspension received because having anything other than the devs strategy means you are accused of throwing a match.---original review below...this game has just gone from bad to worse.the match making is horrendous and alway has been since the introduction of team win / loose mmr opposed to personal skills / contribution being rewarded. the game just doesn't have enough experienced players for you not to have a team peppered with lower skills or lack understanding of the main objective. the problem with this is your mmr value is penalised due to mmr only being awarded for a match win (so regardless of how well you do personally). the devs solution to this is not to fix match making but to hide the mmr value from almost everywhere, with the last remaining mention of it earmarked for removal if/when ranked play is finally introduced.furthermore the matchmaking has been bust since players were able to group and raise their mmr by often queuing against solo players. there is no option as a solo player to opt out of being stomped by a team on a 3rd party voip that has a team coordination advantage. a solution to this was introduced to split groups during balancing if the team mmr disparity was above a certain threshold but this has subsequently been removed. the shrinking of maps dumbed down the strategy in the game and increased the death match style it currently has with very short respawn times based on level rather than personal death rate. other changes such as opening up a path to your base if you loose a gamma 3 fight further dumbed down the game as it made the match almost entirely about the outcome of gamma 3.there are so few players that the queue times for a match are insane, i'm talking around an hour or more waiting for a match in what is known as the bracket 4 player pool. this is the case even though over 2 thirds of the previous days highest concurrent player count are ingame.expect ai bots in pvp until you reach bracket 4 too.still no voip service available in game and the next most pressing feature to be added is the addition of a new in game store, eh yeah go figure the priorities...edit: you also aren't given the choice of what game mode you wish to play within pvp so if you don't like the frontline mode it's tough because you can be placed into either frontline or conquest. another bizare decision as both modes require the same number of players. it's like they deliberatly think of ways to cheese off the playerbase.since the current experience is beyond frustrating i can't recommend it with the problems it has.",0

11909,"can't recommend the game right now. (edit below)to name a few reasons why:- the game is unoptimized. heavily. probably the most unoptiomized game i've played in years. the graphics and visuals are okay, but even when you have a 1080ti - i7 - 16gb of ram and good hdd, it stutters, lags, textures take a bit to load every time on characters, menus seem to stutter the game when you open them.- the server issues are bad, too. frequent disconnects, i've tried on both 20/20 and 50/50 vdsl. didn't matter one bit. if there are too many connections, there's good chance you'll be stuck at splash screen, no matter your connection. the game doesn't try to reconnect again and you're forced to restart the game. that might also happen if you randomly disconnect after finally getting in, so atm you have a chance to be one of the lucky ones to not be disconnected, or be the unlucky ones who gets to play 20mins out of 4h you spend logging in.- the translation is pretty bad. i suppose it could be forgiven, if the devs didn't say they spent 60 millions on getting the game to na/eu.- the combat system was dumbed down. if you're looking for an experience similiar to bdo or even tera, you won't get it, not afaik anyway. i looked and looked and couldn't find the action combat option in menus, while it was there in jp version. right now the na/eu version has tab targetting, and sometimes it doesn't work.- the voice over half the time sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom with an old mic too close to mouth, it's terrible.i think that's all. and if the devs really improve the optimization, server issues and translations, i'd happily change this review and try the game again, but atm, for the price, bless online is not worth leaving other mmo's for.edit: - the game is still broken af. the recent nerf of damage brought all classes to 50-75% dmg nerf which makes main story quests undoable as dps.- the marketplace is set in the same way as gw2 marketplace. there are no set prices.- there is no account-shared storage. also there is no player-to-player trading.- the game has huge memory leak, taking 7-13gb of ram when just on.here's a report of doing the first lvl 13 dungeon as 4 classes, two dps, tank and healer.",0

5534,"i'll make this simple and give you a few pros and cons then my general opinion.pros:it is world of tanks on a smaller scale, making performance on some tanks much better than the original game.seperation of tiers is nowhere near as bad as in wot pc, if you've played wot on pc you'll know that you can play tanks two tiers above you, that doesn't exist in here.good graphics for a mobile game which makes it playable on low end laptops. (i use to play wot on pc but recently the graphics were causing my laptop to overheat)cons:same ol' wargaming paywall, some premium tanks are a bit overpowered (such as the bt-sv) and the blitz biathalon is a load of bs. i almost made it through spring maneuvers if not for not owning a tier v tank and it was okay, but the biathalon features a special currency that can only be earned once. i failed to earn enough of it and can no longer play the event unless i pay gold.while the uptiered problem is less in this game, it still exists and some tanks are underpowered when they play higher tiers.the problem of having to play the next tank is very prevalent, as compared to war thunder where any vehicle can be researched by any vehicle of the same nation, and the garage slots is annoying especially with the more expensive tier v+ vehicles.consesus: while i can complain about wotb all day, i still enjoy it. i'm pretty good in certain tanks and the game runs well on my laptop. if you suck at the full pc game, i suggest trying this, it is easier and quicker than the other game, not to mention the graphics are easier on laptops. the biggest fault is that wargaming accounts do not transfer over, which means you have to set up a new account and cannot have the tanks you have in the full game. i would definitely want to see this game expanded and have other nations added (i.e. czechloslovakia), but would love to see wargamaing fix some of their major problems.8/10 pretty good but not without major fault.",1

5545,"its a decent game that receives a lot of criticism because of its paid to win approach. what more can you expect from a free to play game? war gaming is a business, you need to remember that, their aim is to make a profit for themselves so that they can live their personal lives and expand the game further. people buying god packs or premium tanks pay so that they can enjoy their good tanks, of course war gaming needs to give those said tanks a slight advantage over other normal tanks. duh!!! however, if you think about it, most premium vehicles have pretty serious issues and if you are smart, you would find ways to counter them.kv-5: its slow with good frontal armour, flank around and hit is from sides or rear. if you are a heavy, hit its obvious and big machine gun post.su-100y: big tank with little camoflaughe capabilities, its armour is pretty weak as well, it has a big gun, thats all.is-6: good all around tank, but bad rofe25: bad base damage so a peek a boom method will suffice.\t54-mod 1: good armour, but pretty bad top speed and penetration level for its tier.and so on, you will see that there are pretty obvious weaknesses, if you are a good player, you will learn to exploit these weaknesses.overall, i dont encounter cheaters at all, pretty rare if you do find one. there is a problem with afk's though, so if warggaming remedies that problem, it will be a good game. overall, don't hate so much on wargaming, they did a decent job developing this game and i will give the props to them. come at me hatersthanks for reading my review and have a nice day, constructive criticism can be usefull",1

14440,"do not get this game. wow!it has only gotten worse and worse. back in 2014 everything was fantastic! we had a cool tech tree that inspired all players to keep playing, building, battling, and creating. there use to be a bunch of good game mechanics and the play was addicting and would keep you satisfied foralmost every battle. since then, a lot has changed. everyone was excited when we heard we would get new weapons and better parts, but there were some changes to how much rp (robo points) you could get from winning. the changes kept coming, with each update going one step forward and three steps back. back in the good days, there were various tiers of blocks, with the higher tier blocks having more health than the previous tier. those had good things and bad things, but for the most part they were good. (each tier of block would be a different color, essentially meaning the paint that we have now was all free and you didn't have to buy premium to get cool colors.) the update back in the winter of 2015 changed a lot. with the various block tiers gone, the millions of rp that i had spent on strong&healthy blocks had all gone to wast, with no refund! i could also get into the ranking system. it used to be great, allowing for higher tier items to go into lower tiers, wich allowed for more fun. even though it may sound unfair it would not be an effective strategy for actuall combat. this system worked well and rank was built around each weapon having a different robo score. but as with all good things in robocraft, that was removed. and instead, it was replaced by a system that still had tiers, but wasn't as fun. adding restrictions to a creative game is just something that doesn't ever work out too well. eventually the tier system was abolished and replaced with a system that puts you in a match with robots that have a similar overall robot level. that was nothing compared to what it has turned into now. now, the tech tree idea has been trashed and instead replaced by a rarety system with crates. this new update completely killed robocraft. (as if the other updates hadn't done enough damage already) the game is no longer based around skill or experience, it is pure luck. you used to be able to get new items by buying them off the shop with the rp you had earned by battling, (the better you did the more you earned) but now, the only way you will be able to get your hands on that nice plasma cannon is by opening a crate and praying that you get it. and as others have said, the current game, as it stands, is purely luck based.well freejam ill give it to you, you sure do know how to ruine a great game!tl;drthe game now suckspoint system has gone tobr>no longer an insentive to playall luck, no skilldon't waste your time on this gameused to be fantastic game butdevs killed it this just shows how much the devs don't care. fact!all the cool building they are doing in the trailer/video are with the old version, when it didn't suck as bad!",0

5690,i have played this game quite a bit. this game is very detailed in ariel combat. this is a learning simulator so if you have the patience to take time to learn the plane that you would like to learn than this game is for you. the detail in the planes is so amazing! the one plane that i instantly fell inlove with was the a-10 worthog. i really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. you also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!anyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.,1

4913,"overall, a good game i'd recommend to anyone looking for anyone who'd like a little more action in their moba.as compared to dota 2 and lol, smite's camera and ability style allows it to put players more in the action and therefore has faster paced gameplay while not compromising the strategy and depth of items in a character's builds. pros:- excellent character selection; 85+ and counting, all with interesting passive and active abilities- pretty consistent updates; every other tuesday, with patch notes usually released every other thursday/friday- free to play; anything that matters can be unlocked through playing the game- actually has some pretty beautiful graphics and views, especially since every map is inspired by some sort of mythology- has more than one map- see p.s.; too long to explain herecons- because of the amount of items, absolute newbies can find it difficult to pick up. i did.- some gods may feel unfair to newer players, especially anubis or loki. with practice, however, both are merely nusiances- community can be pretty annoying, especially in ranked- hirez will sometimes unnecessarily nerf gods or items to the point where they're unusable, but they usually do a moderately good job of bringing them backeverything considered, it's a fun game that's best enjoyed with a couple of friends to queue alongside you and help one another through discovering and learning the build meta of each role and god. p.s.: the game has daily login rewards that grow with each sequential login. assuming you login every day for a week, you get something like 1-2 dollars worth of the game's paid currency, gems, which seems pretty damn nice from my experience with other free to play games.",1

2524,"while this is a good game, it is rediculously biased. when i first got this game it was a blast and i had a good time. so based on gameplay i would have given it a positive recommendation. i am an older gamer, from the mid 80's and as a rule i dont like making ingame purchases. but i am also an american and lack common sense. ask any canadian about us. anyways, i made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all lost when i bought some upgrades. by no means did these upgrades use all of it. i submitted a ticket and to make a long story short i was told i would not be refunded the ingame currency and that i must have spent it all. what makes this all ludicrous is i never recieved the upgrades i supposedly spent everything on. i never played it again. in hindsight i dont feel i really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. so i hope my review will temper the very positive rating they have right now since i dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. i will just go back to wot where i haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your iq is 3 points above . that would be 73 points for all you guys who dont quite hit the mark...",0

13191,"i'd like to give this a neutral review but since that's not an option, i'll give a slight recommendation.first, i'd like to address the elephant in the room. this game was originally developed for tablet, which, as you should know, means that if you expect a real game, you're gonna be disappointed. if you want a real game that you can play for at least two to five hours without taking a break or getting bored, you may wanna take a look at sheltered or something similar. generally, it's a good idea to stay away from f2p or tablet games if you want a real game. also, obviously, the controls are mediocre at best and annoying at worst, it really shows that it wasn't originally designed for pc.ok, now that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review part. the core gameplay mechanics seem pretty generic, as it can be expected from a f2p game. that's not really a bad thing though since it's basically a waiting game which means it is expected to deal with pretty basic mechanics. click on things to collect resources and items, click on people to let them level up, and so on. if you want to loose, you have to try very hard (if it's even possible to let everyone in your vault die, unless you play on survival), if you want to win you have to spend money or play for a very long time (what i mean by winning is having built everything that you want to build). nothing new.the game will continue to run if you are logged out, and obviously while you're not online, you won't be able to collect anything. that is also not really bad though because after a short while, the resource consumption will be halted. so you will have a little less resources when you log back in but they won't be completely depleted.generally, if you don't want to spend money on it, it seems to be a good idea to just log in every couple of hours, collect everything, send some people on quests, start a new weapon/armor production, maybe use speed-mode a couple of times to get a few caps and fill your resource-storage faster and once everything seems good, you can log out again. just don't forget to check your statistics-screen every once in a while, to make sure that your production per minute is still higher than your consumption per minute.also, there are a couple bugs, crashes and other issues. if you decide to play this game, maybe you have already played some early access titles where the developers simply stopped to care and never fixed any bugs or anything? this game will remind you of that. there is absolutely no communication from the developer, certain bugs have been known for years but no one cared enough to fix them. after a simple look at the discussions you will also probably find that you shouldn't get too attatched to your vault and definitely shouldn't spend any money on it. almost every day i looked, there has been at least one thread on front page complaining about the game being unplayable due to crashes/freezes/etc or the save file being corrupted/disappeared. so it definitely is a bit of a gamble.if everything works and you are lucky enough to not run into any game breaking bugs it can be fun but that is definitely not guaranteed. so if you like waiting games you can definitely give it a try but i would strongly suggest to not support the developer by buying anything in this game until they start to care a little bit more and fix bugs and other problems.",0

12984,"another stereotypical fee to play game designed to be nothing more than a hook to try and make you pay for something you don't need.a lot of the game has intended annoyances toyou off in order to push you to buying lunchboxes for extra loot, such as random events interrupting resource management, the rng on the rush attempts causing some random events, raider invasions and the need to constantly send people out to collect items so you can keep your residents protected and increase their stats to improve the overall perfomance of resource management.the game starts off fine, build your first few rooms, assign people to their best suited areas, get some preggos going so you can boost your population as early as possible to unlock more rooms and complete the little quests for caps and early game lunchboxes.once your population is in the 20s resource management becomes more of a juggle game to the point you will find yourself thinking, do i risk rushing to get that early collection of resources or do i not incase it causes a fire/infestation stopping any resource collection in that room and also rolling back the timer then adding extra time to it as well as -10% on the next rush attempt. i normally opted to not rush because i either have really bad luck or the % shown is not the actual chance it will succeed (potentially another attempt to frustrate you into buying lunchboxes). quests when they are available are also weirdly done, you find yourself chasing level and item requirements quite a lot, and even then when you meet them there is no gaurentee that you will be able to do it. i had one that was a level 5 quest with 2+ weapon requirements only for my entire team to get 2hit by a boss with a knife, tried again with more stimpacks, same result.all this is passable until you start getting big, the larger my vault got the more the performance issues started to happen. there was at least one crash every day. now i'm at the point where i get in my vault, do one thing then it crashes. what caused this? adding an elevator. well time to uninstall.don't expect much of this game it's one of the worst perfoming game of the fee to play stuff on here i've ever played, and i've played a lot of",0

1016,"lots of strategy and tactics and a lot more as this game develops. i play a ton of wot and this is more involved in your strategy and tactics options. i would recommend the short tutorial, then go to the firing range for a few minutes, then do the tutorial again, and then jump into the game. there is a match making rating system to try to keep balance and have new players with new players. you can fly with friends, you can have your own test matches against friends. currently there are issues with matchmaking struggling to put together games, so the two minute wait can sometimes be more like 5 minutes. the game is much more about playing than grinding. i put my money on it to support it, and thus far it is not pay to win. games can last 20 minutes and the action ratchets up as you get bonuses built up. the win or loss as the players get more experienced can almost be a surprise - you thought you had more time, or you didn\'t evade and get to where you were needed. watch the videos on the starter ships also. definitely worth a try, and coming back to again and again as they finish polishing it. remember it is in the final stages of alpha, but it is completely playable, and just darn good.",1

9204,"i love this game s here a few thoughts why.pros:massiv scale with infantery, vehicle and aircombat mixed in. looking for small fights? you find them on the less occupied lanes. looking for several hundreds of players in one spot? your covered as well.as a new player you start with the best weapon for each class! every other weapon is just a sidegrad. example? medics are intended as supports and get a rifle thats effective close to medium range but you can unlock (through ingame currency or real money your choice) rifles that are better at hipfire and so in close range but less effective in medium and long range.you're an average or good shooter? you'll get tones of ingame currency to unlock what you want fast!you're a bad shooter? you're still covered! either through using your skill to get close to enemies with light assault jetpacks or invisibility from the infiltrator and oneshot them from behind (there are certain weapons for that) or by supporting as medic and engineer or by deplyoing mobile spawnpoints or by playing artillery as a tank holding down shokepoints from afar and raking in kills and assists that way.pro & con:outfits. outfits are like guilds in any other mmo. beeing in on makes planetside shine! nothing greater than winning a figth while beeing outnumbered 3 to 1!why that here and not in pro? -> getting in one as a new player is confusing. there are some outfits that just want to be big and invite every new player they find but then you are in an outfit that most of the time hast several hundred or thousand inactive players and no leadership and organisation. fun factor equals zero...so then without the game telling you how you need to leave the outfit and find a new one. if you have experiance in mmos it's easy but otherwise you got no clue since the game does not lead you.i love to unlock stuff! games were i got everything bore me most of the time. planetside has at the moment a really nice pace for unlocking stuff. it takes me around 12 hours to unlock the most expensive stuff at 1000 ingame currency and i am a medium good player. meaning i have friend who are just half as effective and those who are way faster.you can't unlock class and vehicle upgrades with money. that is for me a good thing but others will be discouraged because there are some neat sidegrades for the vehicles and classes that take tones of time to unlock. since generally the first and fith tier are the only noticable ones the in betweens sadly dont matter most of the time on the other hand does that mean new players are competetiv from the start.you can buy weapons, implants, boosts and cosmetics with real money. i like that! you want something now? buy it. not necessary but helps especially when you start the game. as a long time player you now how to make certs in a fun way and when. as a new player thats hard and so buying sometimes help to have fun. personally i started buying first after a few hundred hours as i noticed i want to stick to the game.the graphics still look really nice on the highest setting! but i personally can hitwith all the light effects and recommend some of the optimazation guides on youtube or elsewhere. helps a lot with fps and you get mor kills cause the other guy has nicer effects but you get the kill cause you can see him.cons:you need a relativ strong new pc to run the game with high graphic settings and decent fps.construction -> it is part of the game they infested much time in but... it is not good at the moment. in short you can build playermade structures of all kind and have really awesome battles there! just theres no reason... the only reason up to now was a building generating victory points. but... this building is so extremly easely killed (max crash google it if interessted) that building a real base was a waste of time. so you try to exploit the terrain and make it hard to reach with out building much else at all and then go somewhere else. problem is you could defend against said max crash but frontlines are shifting and building a base right at the front is suicidal because building defence takes time and either the enemy rushes you or the front got pushed away by your allies.worst part enemies tend to ignore your base because you get near to nothing for attacking it. same for the defenders you get near to no points for standing there and waiting.implants -> the only possible pay to win aspect of the game. is it game breaking? no since if you're the better shooter or surprised them or outnumber them or you sit in a rocket shooting aircraft while hes on the ground you drop a grenade mine or c4 before his feet or... it doesn't matter especially in the big fights that make planetside so great! but in a small scale battle with even skill its sligthly annoying.as a new player just by playing you get a random selection of tier 1 implants. the highes tier is 5. you get more implants by winning alerts (playertriggered ingame events) and you get the second currency needed to upgrad thoses. problem tier 2 & 3 aren't worth anything the boni compared to tier 1 are minimal. tier 4 costs 900 iso per implant and is a real upgrade. you get 100 iso per won alert, 50 for second place and 30 for last place. at best you could earn around 100 iso per hour but thats unrealistic. and tier 5 costs around 2000 iso. the tier 5 bonus is significant thou. sooo why pay to win? an example are the implants battle hardend (reduces flinching while getting hit) and assimilate (you get shields back by killing someone with headshots) on tier 5 battle hardend gives you 50% reduced flinch from enemy fire same as tier 4 but on a kill that bonus is doubled making it easier to aim afterwards because you have just recoil to compensate for. assimilate on tier 5 replenishes 200 from your 500 shields after a headshot kill and recovers 30% of your current special energy (healing for a medic, jetpacks for a light assault, overshield for a heavy and invisibily on an infiltrator).you can buy crates that hold aditional implants which you can trade for iso. these crates can be bought for 300 ingame currency for a small one (you should never do that bad trade) or for 750 ingame currency (takes me as an average player around 10 hours to earn) or you pay for them with real money for a random lootbox. meaning more money dumped equals a higher chance of getting the implant you want and having the resouces to upgrade them.",1

89,"this game is free? how? 10/10about 300 rooms in. game started of very simple: just cardboard pictures of cartoon-like ghosts and skeletons. eventually sh*t starts getting creepy: things start chasing you and, as research lab databases show, there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go. i loved the mini-games: a great relief from the game's jump scares.although i think jump scares are cheap, and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a horror games (fnaf), this game uses them effectively: creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cut-outs while being chased by a head-eating (resident evil-like) monster.this game has a strange effect as i want to continue on just one room more i tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor (which i nervously walk down) or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight(???) worth the 000.00 i invested and i'm looking forward to the 1000th room (if i ever get there). game-play: 8/10helpless at the start...and so far still like that. controls are simple but work effectively.graphics: 9/10simple cartoons at start but develops to much darker images.polish: 8/10funny (spooky girl), detailed backlog of each monster and fear. what more to ask for?",1

13196,"i'm not an expert on this type of game, but can say that tiny tower (nimblebit) circa 2014 was way less infuriating and way more engaging.i've played both on mobile and on pc. the game is much more suited for mobile, but it was too difficult on a small screen. attackers at the door, then a stray touch (easy to do on bezel-less and curved screen phones) would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen...zoom back out, try to grab a 3mm tall guy on the screen, but can't do that until the resources are collected...collect the resources, misclick trying to tap-hold the guy 3 more times, zoom back in, grab him, slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom, have the screen not register your finger for a moment while dragging him, scroll back down to that room, grab him again, and finally...stick him in the front room. now check his weapon, try sorting the weapon list, but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapons to find your one rare/legendary that you stuck on someone after a failed rush...now you have 1 defender! of course, the fight's halfway over now, people are dead.now, watch slow, mostly passive combat with quirky, seemingly redundant controls. are we having fun yet? terrible experience, boring as hell. and now you've wasted 8 hours of travel time because you wanted to save a few medpacks for incident emergencies.later, once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity, even if you don't have a radio station, watch deathclaws rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunting rifle equivalents. rage quit. come back a bit later, get hit with deathclaws again before you've even been able to heal up from the first attack. live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack--or even the next scorpion attack, now that you're out of medpacks and rushing them is too risky--the next attack could wipe out your entire vault. extremely mismatched risk for a game that's mostly planning and hands-off waiting. the best way to avoid losing your vault is to keep the game closed as much as possible. lol?next day, your phone screen turns on once in the middle of the night...wake up to a pile of bodies and no way to roll back to the last save. give up on that vault. there's so much waiting that you'll probably have the same result after falling asleep during all the excitement.tried switching to pc to deal with pain of moving defenders around to incidents, but it was almost as much a pita as on android. also, the tap zooming is ridiculous. i just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom. --positives: - appropriately priced base game.- the humor is legitimately great, especially for fallout fans.- cloud save doesn't work between steam and android, but you can manually transfer unaltered savefiles between the two platforms. - you can also back up these files, but it's kind of a pain.- possible to edit your saves if you can resist doing things that will ruin progression.- critical hit meter is cool.- epically soporific excitement. waiting 7 minutes for your medpacks to finish, 3 hours for your baby dweller, 3 more for them to grow up, 7 hours for your special point training, 6 hours for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach, 8 hours for your scavenger to return, and 4 days for your weapon, all intermixed with deathclaw panic.--negatives:freemium or not, i expect a lot more from a major studio in terms of design. the basic interface interactions have none of the refinement/friendliness of your average knock-off clash game, and there's a lot to be desired in terms of quality of life. also, deathclaws are ridiculously unbalanced at early levels.started on android, but loads of problems. constant crashing. had to reload game twice each time after it had been fully shut down. quests would take like 10+ seconds of loading screen, usually followed by a crash. this is on probably the most popular flagship phone running oreo. (coudn't get it past the savefile screen on memu either.) hey bethesda, maybe hire some mobile devs...on day 1, my phone actually warned me the app had crashed 10 times and that it was slowing down my phone. --if you could turn deathclaws off in normal mode or if the controls didn't so often get in the way of reacting quickly (eg preset loadouts, or pausing game while using equipment/garrison interfaces) i'd be way more excited about this game. -- edit: oh yeah, and the rush %sages are absolute garbage. 40%=90%. this mechanic isn't clever or challenging, it's just dumb. given their obnoxious interface, the number should 1. accurately reflect the base rate, obviously, and 2. visibly change based on the luck modifiers present so you don't have to tediously check every dweller's setup.whoever designed this mechanic should see if mcd's is hiring.",0

5057,"brawlhalla is similar to games like super smash bros, awesomenauts, etc.the overall concept of the game is excellent. it removes a little of the casual feel of other games in it's genre, and i believe it will appeal to more technical gamers.the characters are all available to play right now while it is in beta, but they will be purchasable with in-game earned gold upon release (i believe), similar to the way you'd buy champions in lol, dirty bomb, and loads of other free to play games.the characters themselves are pretty cool. the art style is simple, effective, and in my opinion, beautiful. each one has a unique moveset and has 2 weapon pick-ups available for it. the attacks feel clean and the hitboxes make sense, the dodge cooldown seems perfect to me and longer, skilled fights will make you break out in a sweat. a few awesome modes, slight character customization, and a very solid 1v1 ranked system are all just toppings on an already delicious cake.10/10 definitely recommend for any brawler fan.",1
14618,"this game is terrible. i have over 270 hours of game time, so id know. myself, and many others, loved this game before. however recent 'updates' made this game awful. items started costing millions, you made 90% less, and mega bots were removed. but wait, theres more, now its a game of chance for what items you get, new players have no chance. you need to spend hundreds to even have a chance at some good items. also. if your not premium, you get half as much. the grinding after lvl 100 is unheard of. this game used to be my favorite, then maximum loadout came, then 90% nerf, then my megabot i spent hundreds of hours of grinding dissapearing within a week of getting it. also the devs hate everyone, they only want money, not good gaming expierences. so dont bother recommending things to them. if you dont have this awful excuse of a game, dont get it. if you have it and havent considered unistalling, i dont know how. so if you dont have a free 100 hours a week for video games, or are prepared to spend hundreds, its useless. rant over. going to play games that accually provide entertainmentupdated review: ive went back to the game for a round just to see what its like, here you go. spamming automatic lock on weapons seem to do more damage than full plasma bursts which require alot of aim. every bot can have every weapon so theres no need for medics, snipers, tanks, or team play at all really. im not sure whats going on with maps but the last few times ive played its been the same one, and its quite boring, you just dont get the robocraft feel anymore. this game is literally going backwards and its peak was 2014-15, strongly recommend not installing this game.",0

8576,"so...i started playing this game about a week ago. absolutely loved it. it's important to note that i usually hate battle royale games. but not this game.this game took (emphasis on past tense), all the things i hated about the battle royale genre, and threw them out the window.it was colorfull, without being minecraft. it wasn't a camping simulator. and the rgn in this game was limited.you were encouraged, no, required to fight, if you wanted to have a good chance at winning. the best weapons and equipment didn't randomly drop somewhere, you had to craft them at a forge. crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player. this, and the fact that you got a reward (shards, which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general) whenver you killed another player, made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights. because fights were encouraged, and they were worth taking the risk.people couldn't just drop somewhere far off, loot everything and then camp.that is, until a few days ago. ignoring every bit of community feedback, the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out, and unique, and good, and threw it out the window.it's the same rng infested, camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now, that every other battle royale game already is too.you can find dozens of similar games now, with the only difference between them and this game being, that they are less colorfull, and their developers probably don't ignore the feedback from their community (unlike this game)",0
12512,this game takes so much away from my laptop. i cannot get the most out of it. i'll have to upgrade. i really wish this was a 29.99 game and included just a few of these series. i would have bought it outright. this pay for this and then something else comes out later that you want to buy and damn no money. i hate this type of scenario. just offer it up at one price and get everything. or break it up into two or three games for 19.99. you would have a customer. i am sick of getting excited and then haivng to uninstall and then three months later hey they got dtm and then downloading it once again but then finding out that you cannot access all the tracks. annoying.,0

16766,"autoinstalls gaijin and starts seeding. do not install.edit: i was going to remove my review since they made gaijin optional, then i saw a developer saying this:gaijin net agent is completely harmless and useful software, and not using it can lead to delays in updates, if steam updates are switched off/or not effecient.i fail to see why steam updates would be switched off or would be inefficient. there are plenty of developers on steam right now that don't use third party software to update their games. whether you're referring to players disabling steam auto update or you guys disabling steam updates for the game yourselves, it really doesn't matter. players that disable auto update do it for a reason, so you really can't call that inefficient. if you guys disable steam updates for the game, then it better be for troubleshooting purposes. other than that, the only reason i can see why you guys would do that is to encourage players to continue to use gaijin by creating a problem that doesn't exist.one of the biggest issues with gaijin is that some players have bandwidth limits, and when gaijin is secretly seeding the game it uses up their bandwidth. it is literally stealing other people's data to save money. to these players who are spending money to update your game, it isn't harmless.",0

7189,"there are few people who have never heard of the ancient scrolls (the elder scrolls), every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans. arena and daggerfol for those who are older, morrowind and oblivion for those younger, and finally skyrim for the youngest. all these games can be called cult, each introduced something of its own into the world of elder scrolls, what we brought the game the elder scrolls online: tamriel unlimited, let's try to figure it out.firstly, i do not agree that this game falls out of the general series, trampling on the canons of scrolls. yes, the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive, he is not elected, as was before, not nerevarin and not dovakin, but only one of thousands out of millions. this seems to hurt.secondly, what do we have? all the same nirn torn by the war and on the brink of death. events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series, probably this fact also embarrasses many.well, in the third, the changed game model, which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case. i can not say that innovations have pleased me, but i have to put up with this.",1

7030,"it's a free game, so we cannot expect a lot. after almost 10 hours played, i feel like it doesn't have much left, that's why i recommend the game, but with some cons.a short opinon: free and entertaining for a few hours (highly recommendable), very limited and grinding after that. in more detail, my main three points are:- game mechanics very good, easy to learn and play.- it's free: if you don't want to, there is no need to pay anything. you can get a lot of card by free, mostly completing story mode, but after that, the game has a very limited options. for all the arenas or you pay some coing (an amount that takes several days* to obtain) or then you have to pay real money.- there are some daily quests, but they can be achieve only in the arena (and maybe in play), but not in practice. as this i the main way to gain coin, makes it harder to enter the arena, and so fulfilling the quests, and so getting money, and so entering the arena... see where i'm going?so, i would rather pay 5 for the game (and then no entry fee for the arena) than having this limited options. they can still earn a lot of money from store (people who wants more and better cards), from the expansions and so.just my opinon, hope it helps someone",1

844,"it's very rare that i am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i don't like. wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game...i mean this game is bad and i mean really bad! the map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. oh let's not forget when i logged in for the very first time, i received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. i literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. i could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. an option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. my gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. i lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out i did not hit him once! so throughout the match i sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. and of all the ridiculous solutions i've found this has got to be the worst. i found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. the trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (i know i'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.and then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which i gotta say wow. people who hack in this game are way too comfortable in cheating. from what i've seen these hackers walk around like yeah i'm cheating...the f*** you gonna do about it?! in some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. but not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so i guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. shame on me for not noticing this sooner. i get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. this game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. the problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (who knows you miles may vary)",0

7535,"this is an awesome game! i played this for quite a while and long into the night along with my friends, raiding dungeons and counting our loot at the end of the day. i see lots of reviews talking about the fact that you can't play this game without eventually having to buy some in-game purchase. now, i'm sure you can manage to play this game without having to buy stuff, (i have bought nothing so far), but it is definitely very helpful to buy something (like a better flask). i bought a better flask at one point, and a new character, but i purchased both of these with the credits or whatever the currency was with what i got for free just by playing the game or by special event things.the gameplay is very fun, and it is quite relaxing, honestly, the just roam around and take over all the dungeons you see. although i haven't delved into the later game stuff, (i think there is pvp?), or the shadow tower stuff and many other things, but i have almost 30 hours in the game at this point and it is still quite fun!i totally recommend this game and it is a lot of fun to play with friends.",1

6055,"i'd love to be able to play this, but unfortunately i only managed to play for about 10 minutes before it terminaly crashed and has resisted all of my attempts to resurrect it back to life !!!i'm really frustrated, i've reinstalled about 3 seperate times and a tried few other suggestions from online but all to no avail.!!tried contacting devs too, but still no joy.!!i don't know what else to do but check back to see if it's been updated from time to time.ssiiigghhh...!!!...",0
3656,"currently the game is awful. it lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. quickplay is gone. it's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called casual. it's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. dosn't help that the queue times are god awful as well. i managed to watch 3 entire sgbplay mario party videos, which are about 1:30 hours long each, before entering a single match of badwater that lasted about 10 minutes. and in those 10 minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of morgan freeman, or the team hoovy/spycrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. hell, even the lenny/bind spammers are gone. this simple move has taken all the character and charm tf2 had andall over it.next is the balancing. this game has horrible balancing. especially since valve doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. only listening to the competitive players. people like b4nny and mr.slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by valve, and to what has that opinion led? phlog buff of smissmass 2015 and caber nerf of summer 2015. two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the phlog became the walk and die weapon of the century. this update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. come on, who was complaining about the buffalo steak sandvich!? who complained enough to say it needed a nerf!? next is the communication. valve communicating with the community, what a pipedream. they never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. at most we get the ocassional neato in the sub-reddit. and why you might ask? because the tf team is 5 people who don't care/give aabout their own game. overwatch was released, one would expect valve to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with heavy vs pyro, which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. if valve simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. most of the tf community would be happy knowing that valve didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. and finally, my biggest gripe with tf2 currently, it's more personal and i know i'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of mac support. i run tf2 on mac, which some might call , but at least i run tf2 at 230 fps. well would run it. the game is in such a state where the mac support died off about 3 months ago. the game constantly crashes with the error out of memory or because the game failed to load a single texture. not to mention the game loads textures one at a time. for mac users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. so for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to 3 hours on 2fort alone. also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the retriving server info part of the loading screen. i'm not sure if windows/linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the mac to crash in some way or another. there's even been instances where my entire computer, not just tf2, but all of it crashed due to tf2 failing to load me in. the last true patch mac ever got was about 1 year ago in gun mettle, where valve did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? this is a tf2 only issue, gmod runs fine, cs:go runs fine, but tf2 doesn't. the game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. doesn't even feel valve is the one making the game anymore. it feels like ea or god-fobid ubisoft took the wheel with this game.",0

2870,"came back after a year hiatus because there was a long list of issues i had with the game, everyone knows about the extraordinary long grinding time, which, fine its free to play, what more do you want? wargaming's own research model isn't nearly as punitive for free to play players from how it feels. i don't play world of tanks, just warships, so i could be wrong on that factor 100%. enough beating the horse. war thunder's new matchmaking method still sucks. in fact i would go as far as to say it had gotten worse. it only seems to serve as a way to stack lower tiered players against higher tiered players (on both sides gotta get that two way action of frustration going) in order tooff the lower tier players into coughing up cash to tier up only to find they get matched with vehicles of a still higher tier and the cycle only ends if you cough up that dosh to tier 5 where all you have to do is worry about players like myself that suffered up to the tier 5 grind. this seems to be more of a problem for armor than it does aviation where a bit more skill appears to be involved if you are outmatched against a better performing fighter. unless you are prepared for the level of frustration that comes before you, its best to pick a game you will actually enjoy instead of grinding frustration simulator designed to try and coerce money out of your wallet. if you don't take this seriously, the encyclopedia dramatica article concerning it will in fact point you in the direct of a more humerous and shockingly true overview. don't believe me still? play the game then re-read the article and you will smack yourself on the forehead.4/7/2018the game kept starting the launcher for something i thought i uninstalled, turns out if you use steam, it will delete the files used to install via steam, but everything that the launcher installed stays in a folder that was 17 gb and continued to keep launching the launcher whenver i logged into my computer, unchecked the auto-start option, which didn't work, deleted the registry for startup via ccleaner which didnt work and would reassign itself to launch at the start of logging in, so i deleted the whole folder which solves the problem. as it would turn out, this is a result of lazy developers producing rootkit tier programming. i still dont reccomend the game, this sore spot aside, due to apperent imbalances with maps that they know have problems.",0

10128,"okay, let me start by saying a couple of things. one. yes, i absolutely recommend this game. two. yes, the payment model is an absolute mess and some things that are paid are just silly. however, under said payment model there are also a lot misconceptions (mostly concerning licenses and ammo) due to a lack of explanation on the devs end and also youtubers doing reviews on games that they've played for 8 minutes and 7 seconds. allow me to break it all down for you.the payment model and memberships let me just start by saying that i'm not here to defend this business model because it is atrocious and is not my favorite by a long shot. i know there are a lot of players that won't try this game because of half-cocked reviews and lack of explanation. expansive worlds, this is also your fault. don't charge for trophy shot poses... c'mon. okay, okay, the store... ugh, yes every weapon (pretty much) is paid. here's the thing. you don't need every weapon out of the gate, that's just silly. so the way it works is hunterscore. hunterscore is a based on a total point count that comes from reaching various milestones. your first kill is your first milestone (per weapon and per species). from there you are given points to your score for 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 kills. yes, every weapon (apart from a few exclusives that don't contribute to the score) requires 1000 kills to achieve the maximum hunter score. so day one, you want to try the game out and feel overwhelmed by the amount of weapons for sale. that's normal. even the starting .243 requires 1000 kills. start with it. it takes a long time to get that 1000 kills. max it and get another weapon every 2-3 weeks. or buy everything in the game at once and send your wife into a coma like i did :) let me explain why that's pointless. i own all the things! cool! except it's not. i now have 18, 52, 11 rifles that have 1-30 kills each and the chances that i'll reach 1000 with them are now so low that my brother can't even walk under them (he's short). point: get a weapon or two and go with them for the first while.okay b00m, i bought a weapon but there's no way i'm going to keep buying ammo for it when it runs out. that's where the membership comes in. it's $9.99 for 3 months. it's not that bad. what makes it bad is all of the other stuff in unison. clothing, weapons, scent eliminators. with that membership your ammo will not run out. each rifle, pistol and bow come with 30 rounds or arrows (150 for the .22 and .17). birdshot for a shotgun come with 90. those numbers are per hunt. once they are gone they are only gone for that hunt. start up another and you'll see it right back in your lodge. but it's not enough ammo for a hunt! yes, yes it is. stop shooting holes in the clouds and trying to saw down trees with arrows. it's not helping. if you are sending 30 rounds through a .243 in 15 minutes then you're doing it wrong. if you shoot that bad at a walking target you should be spending your time at the range and not in the field.cool, i'm not buying a license for each animal either. no? well, neither am i because that's stupid on 318 levels. if you bought one for an animal then i'm not calling you stupid. thaw out snowflake and keep reading. that same membership takes care of that as well. if you want to play one hunt a month and have a life outside of games then the individual license may be more practical for you. long term players should not be touching those silly things.as far as clothing and all the other stuff goes, listen up. a lot of that is preference (not all). the outfit matters as each one has certain effects on certain animals. it's not that drastic. yes, you'll blend better with the appropriate camo but it won't be game breaking to play without it until you decide to get it. i also bought all the clothing (she's still hotter that 400 hells). tents, stands and things like that are quality of life. if you want them, buy them. if not, the game won't force close and take you to the store with it's hand out. on a side note, tents serve as spawn points and with the reserves being quite large, i recommend a couple but that's entirely up to you. i've probably skipped out on 100 rares jumping around the reserve. walking from place to place is never a bad idea anyway.callers are one of the more reasonably priced items in the game (compared to the other stuff) but can still get a little expensive if all are bought at once. nickel and dime from week to week or month to month and it's not bad. also, look at the caller bundles.duck/goose blinds lol stay away from ducks and geese until you are sure you want to stay for the long haul because a fowl setup is outright dumb as far as payment. a blind and decoy spread can run you nearly $30... people that have travelled across the country with 3 of their exes in the car have spent less money than us fowl hunters in this game.em's and gm's em's are paid and gm's are earned and also a little on the useless side. gm's are great for things like scents and scent eliminators but that's about the extent of it. there are a few other things which you can browse the store to see. em's can also be earned by placing in competitions and from the uhc website where there are player made competitons and payouts (much higher payouts).okay, so i'm interested in it now. is it fun? absolutely, the sounds, visuals and scope of the game are second to none as far as hunting games. each animal is unique with it's very own score card that breaks down details to levels that i don't even bother reading haha. the reserves are large and the optional content is through the roof if not terribly overpriced. play with friends, join competions (em payouts) and do missons (gm payouts). listen, if you read the review then i appreciate you taking the time to do so. if you still feel like it's too expensive to play then i totally understand that. if you want to stick around and play, then tinker with the free content before getting a membership. just remember that without a membership this game is lacking and it's almost a requirement. if you have any questions or would like to be shown the ropes then i will always help a new player. message me on steam and i'll get you into my discord and get you going. grab yourself a membership after some time and a weapon or two. you'll get out pretty cheap and still have a great experience until the next time you need to buy a thing. expanisive worlds, try to help me make this clear with a big red banner that says you're going to want a membership to enjoy this game. the vids are misleading and it's hardly free to play. you're killing your own reviews.",1
4717,"this game is pay to win.how? you ask? well, let me just say this...i was playing my first casual joust match when i noticed a character was flying above me, he then landed on me and killed me with some finger pistols, or some.. apparently it was the god apollo i thought, huh, that kinda seems unfair... there's a god that can just fly above you in this game and become completely untargetable?? that's so ing t!! but i let it slide... (mind you apollo is not even a default god, and you need a currency called 'gems' to buy gods in this game) (there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money...) so, after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods ao kuang thanatos and guess who get again? yep, you guessed it. apollo. i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that, but to top it off ao kuang and thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and there's no way to escape it, you just instantly die... and it heals ao kuang and then he can fly away and do even more damage, so after my teammate got eaten by an ao kuang, which then landed on me killing me? i just uninstalled. (((none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money) oh yeah, and before i even started playing, there's some gods they released that they didn't even finish, causing massive balance issues. such as hel, artio, and ullr, they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game. if hi-rez fixes these things, i will make my review positive, but as if now i can not reccomend this game.tl;dr: pay to win game with no updates since 2014 after devs abandoned the game, dead community, and extreme balance issues.",0

6980,"despite not besting hearthstone in terms of playerbase, the elder scrolls legends has most certainly outdone blizzard's rng-fest in terms of gameplay. set in the rich universe of tes series, legends is an excellently balanced card game that offers a rewarding experience, regardless of whether you win or lose. not once have i felt like i lost because the game's rng cheated me out of a win (except against the a.i., which does tend to be gamey, but at least it offers a challenge). there's a variety of modes in the game, including a story mode which mainly serves to introduce you to the game mechanices and offers rewards such as starter packs and beggining resources, a practice mode where you can grind for soul gems (this game's version of hearthstone's dust) or try out your new decks, a solo arena and vs. arena, for single player or multiplayer, and finally play mode, which is the standard multiplayer experience of the game, with ranked and unranked options available. throughout each mode, you can acquire resources to earn card packs or individual cards in a manner similiar to hearthstone, which is by purchasing a pack for 100 gold, or summoning cards with soul gems individually. f2p players should feel fully capable of gathering the base cards without any need of spending money, though the game is of high enough quality to where it deserves a few card packs to be paid for here and there. you can also unlock the first expansion for the game, that being the dark brotherhood, with gold, though each chapter is priced at 1,000 gold. a bit excessive, but the expansion is only $20. even so, you don't need the cards that the expansion comes with to be competitive. i was able to reach rank 9 in ranked play with base cards, which is where you earn the rewards for the month. you also can't de-rank back to square one in this game, which is incredibly fair and much appreciated by myself. instead, what happens is that you'll need to win two extra games to go back to climbing up the ladder that you are currently on. much better than getting squashed all the way to the bottom rung like in hs, if you ask me.the cards in the game fall under six different categories; strength, intelligence, agility, endurance, willpower, and basic. you are able to combine two of the categories when making a deck, or focus solely on one category, with the basic cards being available no matter which of the other 5 you choose. this system is excellent, as it allows for a plethora of strategies, synergies, and combo plays that do a tremendous job of keeping any over-bearing meta in the game at bay. i could have probably looked up some guides to show me how to make a stronger deck for any of these combinations, but i've thouroughly enjoyed experimenting with the cards at my disposal myself, and while i've taken plenty of losses, i've also earned plenty of wins.finally, the game's board adds on another layer of depth that helps to make the game even more balanced. unlike hs, the board is divided into two lanes, each capable of holding 4 creatures. one lane is a shadow lane, which gives your creatures cover so that your oppenent can not attack them with a creature until your next turn (although they are still vulnerable to spells and abilities). the other lane offers no bonuses, and is a normal playing space. next are the runes around your character's health bar. each time you lose 5 points of health, you can randomly draw a card from your deck. you may be able to draw a card with the 'prophecy' label, which allows you to play that card on the spot for free, which can quickly swing the tide of the game in your favor if you play them correctly. lastly is the mana ring, which unlike hs, has 3 charges. some have claimed that this item is over powered, and causes the game to favor the player going second. this is not the case. the health runes and the lanes more than make up for the slight advatage that the second player gains with the ring. a second player can easily burn through their charges in an ineffecient way, leaving them to the mercy of the player who used their normal mana curve properly and took advantage of the lane system. additionally, it has been reported that the win rate with the ring is roughly 50/50. that is, the player going first generally wins as many times as the player going second.overall, my complaints are few and far between with tes:l. the game is excellently balanced, and the art style, while perhaps a bit drab when compared to hearthstone, is still excellent (especially if you're looking for something far less cartoony than hs). the main problems with the game are the slow loading menu screens, which favor style over responiveness, and the perhaps the very design of the game itself. it is modelled incredibly similiarly to hs, and though it is not the first game to do this (duelyst comes to mind) it still might be a bit grating for some ccg verterans. while it succeeds at offering an accessible ccg experience that still has great amounts of depth and skill, i do find myself wondering what the game would have been like if it had been made in a more original and complex manner, rather than being designed as a way to combat hs's many flaws. i'd like to see that card game one day, but until then, legends does what it sets out to do very well, and that is to offer an accessible experience that mechanically surpasses hs in nearly every respect. now it would just be nice if more people traded the rng-fest of hs for a game with some amount of skill. maybe you'll be one of those people.",1

10844,"like many others, i came to eternal from the rng fiesta that is hearthstone currently. this game is truly a breath of fresh air in today's digital ccg landscape.pros:1. although there are microtransactions, this game is truly f2p thanks to the generous rewards system. for example, in draft mode (like arena in hearthstone) you get to keep all 48 cards that you choose, on top of the usual rewards for winning. there are also free random cards and gold for ranked wins.2. minimal rng. however, because of the way the mana system works (similar to lands in mtg) you can get mana screwed but proper deck building should mitigate this,3. interactive combat system. this is similar to mtg where you can take some actions (e.g. fast spells) on your opponent's turn, such as when he attacks you. again, i compare this to hearthstone where you pretty much can't do anything on your opponent's turn.4. complex strategy. the cards in the first set are varied and allow for many different deck types. there are 5 factions and you can have all 5 in your deck (albeit risk getting mana screwed). 5. complex tactics. here i'm talking about the skill you need to assess the board state and make plays. each player can have up to 14(?) units on the board and this can lead to deliciously challenging decisions - which units do i attack with and when? which of my opponent's units do i block and with what units?cons:1. clunky ui. this is a minor gripe as it's already in a decent state, just needs a few tweaks.2. small player base. this game isnt hugely popular now and there aren't alot of web resources (no net decks :(). hopefully with the steam release this game will pick up in numbers.overall this game is one of the better ccgs out there. and it's f2p, so there's really no reason not to install it and give it a go.",1

3968,"the meet your match update. i met my match alright, because i can't stand this horrible update. i've been a long time player, been here since the replay update back in may of 2011, and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me. the biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! you're done! nope, with the newest epic content update, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode' casual mode now casual mode is its own can of worms. during the launch of this update, you couldn't even choose the map you wanted to play on. you picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. it goes something like this:1. choose the map and mode you wish to play2. enter the que and wait up to 5 minutes to get into a game3. join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server4. the map ends, everyone disconnects5. repeat steps 1-4 until you die of old age you might be thinking just go play on community servers! if by community servers you mean only 2fort/dustbowl then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. but for a game with 92 different maps spanning across 15 game modes, i think i'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there. there are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't i play on some of them? mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or amazing trade servers. i hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about 9 billion of them to choose from! i live on the east coast of america and mainly play at night. i can hardly ever find a match with 20 players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/2fort. this is unnacceptable. where the hell are all the 50k players at? competitive mode i don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. personally i believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had this mode added. this is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right? wrong. as far as i know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. plenty of time to polish some of its features up. but yet again, valve somehow managed to screw it up. no class restrictions, telephone number required or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards. no class restricitions is self explanatory. you can have about 6 engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but if you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue. the telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to valve? cough up that $10 buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club. now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve 130-damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update). last but not least, no real rewards. valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. they could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level 10 or even level 18. but instead, you get nothing. you upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot. in conclusion tldr this update sucks and i advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again this is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.",0

12381,"let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. there's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. i'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them. multiplayerthe multiplayer is currently still developping. there are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races. payment modelcontrary to the free to play tag this game isn't free to play. a better tag would be free demo, but it seems this can't be helped. i'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. in league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. in raceroom, there is no ingame currency, just vrp, which can be bought for irl money. that's also why i don't think the free to play tag applies.now on to the paymeny model. paying 50 upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. in raceroom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. say you don't like dtm, but do like gt2, then you can just buy the gt2 cars. one thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50. but to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10 for a champion, in raceroom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.i should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it. interfacethe interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's some personal insighti do believe you need a wheel to play this game. you can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience. the sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only dx9 support if i'm not mistaken.as an ending i'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving.",1

2631,was a good game at one point. it is mostly now a cash grab by the moneyhungry devs. if you want to play the game as a free to play it will take a very long time to unlock anything past tier 2 and 3-4-5 are imposible to unlock in a reasonable amount of time withought dropping money into it. now lets not forget the damage models of these planes. if you so much as breath on the wings they will break off. the control of the aircraft in arcade and realalistic arepoor infuriating at times. groundforrces are beond broken. ships dont seem that badf but it feels to little and to late in my oppinion. so if you are looking for a realalistic and well developed combat flight go to il-2. if you wanna goof of and around for a couple hours and dont care much about progresion. its probably for you.,0

14413,"the new 'reward' system has ruined the game in it's entirety. getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept, but there are multiple issues with this. - it removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck.- it encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates; i.e getting points from capping towers that are almost capped, is far greater than doing it yourself.- the item sell values make it near impossible to actually aquire items from the shop without massive ammounts of grinding.- premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want, and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want.- the premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept, but showing the players what they missed out on because they didn't put money into your game, even if they have in past (and got burned on it because of the recent changes) is just cruel.i played this game for a while before the recent overhaul, had quite a few high-tier blocks and high-tier weapons, the former of which cost quite a lot of ingame currency, only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player, meaning the amount of time i spend prior to the change was completely pointless, save for aquiring levels translating to more cpu. in summary; the recent overhaul screwed over a number players, myself included, the only progression available is that of pot luck, and has never been more pay-to-win, with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legendaires more readily available (in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want, far sooner than normal players.)",0

8637,"alright here's the deal with these battle royale games ~are you tired of constantly praying that your opponent doesn't know how to build a skyscraper in half of a second?~how about going through that awkward boring moment when you have to walk a century in order to reach the circle on the other side of the map?~have you finally realized that you can't play pubg and fortnite for the rest of your life?~need a new refreshing game that you want to get addicted to?guess what, realm royale is your solution. what makes this game different? -good question, realm royale implement's a class system where you can choose from 5 classes; warrior, engineer, assassin, mage, and hunter. each class has their own unique skll set creating several combinations that can be used to your advantage, creating more variety. expect the list of classes expanding as development continues. -when you die you will transform into a chicken where you must stay alive as a chicken for 30 seconds until you can have another chance of living. something about killing chickens is always satisying and fun to do. -at any time you can press z to summon your mount that you can elegantly ride across the map that is made up of several different biomes. in each of these biomes you will find a forge.-at these forges you will be able to craft either potions, legendary armor, abilities or your class specific weapon. -but hold it there, you didn't think you would get all this great loot for free did you? of course you didn't. you spend your shards that you create when destroying any loot you find you don't want. you will find a lot of that. -did i mention that you directly dive onto the map? yeah that right, cut the parachute. this game wants you to dive straight into action, cut the bs. - i can't forget the fact that there is no fall damage. that's right, you can finally jump from more than 20 ft and not take any fall damage. might i add that you feel quite heroic when jumping from great heights.-we're all familiar with that experience of running out of ammo mid-fight, well guess what. that will never happen in this game since you have unlimited. -keep in mind that this game is very early in development as of right now and there will be even more features added and improved upon as time goes on. to sum it up realm royale has an incredible amount of potential. out of all the br games, this one is definitely the most arcade-y. it's a lot of fun and if hi-rez doesn't screw this up horrendously it will be able to compete with it's competitors. i am really excited to see how creative hi-rez can make this game. give it a try and stop believing that just because it looks similar to other games it's automatically terrible. it's not. realm royale gives it's own unque spin to the battle royale genre and it clicks. now take a breath and go download the game, i have to go back to dumping more hours into this game. i will see your chicken on the battlefield.",1

15105,"i played this game about a year back (i stopped shortly after they released legs) and came back now to see what happened to the game in the meantime. for someone who really enjoyed how the game used to work, it's a big disappointment now. the removal of blocks with different durabilities might have been a defendable change, since some might argue that it turned the game into a bit of a grind, but replacing it with a system built on loot crates with random contents and weapons as different rarity drops makes no sense in this kind of game. the healing of damage dealt to your robot (at least in the gamemodes where you can actually find a game in a reasonable time) might be nice if it happens to you, but is utterly frustrating when a fast enemy just escapes from your view to return unharmed a few seconds later. for me the fun in the early stages of robocraft was in building a robot with multiple propulsion systems and failsafes to make sure i can still fight after taking damage, it was in batteling a crippeled enemy while trying to angle my weapon with my one remaining leg. of cause it takes away waiting time from the game, but the cost is a lot of what made robocraft unique.it seems like someone decided to take the regeneration of a modern shooter (without taking into account how little sense that makes for robots), the lootcrate system of overwatch (with the difference that the crates actually contain stuff that changes the gameplay, making it almost pay to win) and the slow progression of warframe (which is worse since the game is pvp not pve so the loadout actually matters).i can see how players like some of these changes and i can see how players that played a lot and dont mind to spend some money from time to time will still enjoy the game, but i would not pick it up as a new player, there are better f2p games out there and i would not come back to it if you enjoyed it when it first started. i uninstalled it again; it's a shame, i really enjoyed the original robocraft.",0

15129,the current state of the game is ed.this was in the start really promising. i really liked the game and would have given it a positive review back then. now you can't even get access to most of the stuff in the game because of the loot crates. i can't even choose what stuff i get in a game where the player is supposed to design the vehicle. not their luck. now people who don't pay the developers have to get rekt by chainguns.,0

2829,"(sorry for the bad english) as a gamer who played formerly played world of tanks,this game is one of those hidden gems in the world of gaming from your usuall fps games(counter strike,team fortress 2) i really like it but my rating to this game is its a good game but i want to gave a low rating cause the new 1.37 patch it messed a lot in the tier of playing and the progress just to get a good plane.because of the new patch im late in the tier of the german aviaton all i have is 3 planes of tier 2 plane and 1 tier 3 plane i was outgunned,outpowerd,outtactic with it so the lost of my interest in german planes for the new who played this may not notice but over the years playing it they will notice how long the time to just to get good plane. the graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.but after all the need of the golden eagle(in-game currency)is pretty much very high,im using the british planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with in-game credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss. the in-game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,the new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.considering myself using russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once saw a low tier plane(a6mn) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(b-25 mitchell) in seconds of firing it.so the match making system one of worst in war thunder overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary first person shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game",1

4658,"i have spent a  of time playing this game and all i have to say is i have never been so horribly disappointed by any game i have ever played in my entire ing life. like most moba's. it started out great! the game was fun and fairly well balanced and the community was actually significantly better than the notoriously toxic community's of other moba's such as league of legends. but just like every other game of it's type, it went to absolute ing horsecockery. first and foremost, the company is they don't listen to the community. they get countless complaints all over about different things that are not working as intended or not working at all, severely overpowered gods, and game breaking bugs, but instead of fixing or even acknowledging those problems, they tweak a few minor details once every thousand years that make little to no difference, and are typically things that no one wants or gives aabout. the gods are so horribly unbalanced, and the less skill it takes to play your character the higher your chances of winning. (this if ing fact. loki, poseidon and odin are prime examples) out of the vast supply of existing gods currently in the game i'd say there are maybe 20 that people actually play. there are far too many instances of gods that are just plain better than others. and i don't mean counters. i mean that there are about 5 mages that are 4000x stronger than all of the other mages. and this goes for every single class. not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingout of it in hopes to get more people to spend money on them. i really did love this game when i first started playing it and would easily say that at it's peak, it was the best moba i ever played. but just like other moba's i have watched it slowly decay into the bubblingvolcano that stands before me today. i could spend so much longer talking about everything that myself and many others find wrong with this game at this point in time but i realized that i've already wasted too much. so if you wanna know more reasons why you shouldn't download this taco-bell-shotgun-diahhrea game, feel free to contact me and i can give you more reasons than you could ever possibly need. if i had to thoroughly sum this game up in a sentence, i would call it nothing but a gargantuan ing time vampire.0/1000 would not reccomend to the dark lord himself",0

15096,don't let the 115 hours on record fool you. i've played this game for many hundreds of hours and enjoyed every minute of it. that is until the epic loot update which effectively removed everything fun about the game. robocraft used to allow players to save the ingame currency and work towards what they wanted. now all you can do is wish for luck in an endless grind likened best to gambling for hours with no return. this loot system is the only way to get ingame items and that being said you can never get what you want. do you have an idea for a great robot that you want to test? tough luck you'll have to hope that the freejam overlords look favorable upon you so you may or may not get the gear to make your bot. don't get the wrong idea i don't hate the game or the loot system. the problem is the ingame currency was removed meaning you cant get what you want anymore. this stunts creativity and disables one's ability to make the robots they want to. until the epic loot system is removed and or freejam restores the ingame currency i can not recommend this game to anyone and i will certainly not be spending my money on a company that doesn't care about its player base.edit 1: it has come to my attention that freejam is working to remove the epic loot system and restore teirs as well as removing the boost system! i will change the recomendation from no to yes if and when they follow through on their promises. i may even make this my main go to game who knows?,0

7027,"after spending the majority of my afternoon playing this game i can say it is really good! if you enjoy the elder scrolls series and are found of and tcg like harthstone, magic the gathering, or even the warcraft one, this is for you. it nails how a online trading card game should be. the mechanics are balanced and fair, plus this game is far more skill based over the dumb luck approach that some tcgs take (*cough* hearthstone *cough*). the cards are easy to get through leveling and i quickly found my self with a surplus of options. the game even gives you some tough chocies early on. the race you pick at the start even influences what cards you will be getting more of at the start. the story is decent to. nothing extreme but i found my self chuckling at a couple lines and even caring about one of the characters that shows up. there are also checky nods and reffrences to the es series (not going to spoil them though because some them are worth the reaction). over all i think this is a very good and well made game and i look forward to playing it more.",1

11713,"as a player who tried several bless online releases i'm sad to say the game is not worth spending timeor money on. i'll state the reasons below.>pros:the world is huge and looks ok for how old the game is.open world pvp is somewhat entertaining (slightly ruined by poor class balance).combat system is unique (again, ruined by 25% of skills being buggy or broken).>cons:bad optimisation. game runs very poorly on almost any pc. lags and freezes for 1-1.5 sec upon opening menus or quest logs.huge cash grab for a buy to play game. pay money to teleport to dungeons or res (eliminates dungeon finder tool usefulnes, forces you to run and use chat for finding groups).lies from day 1. the game was released with all but the very skeleton cut from it.no endgame content. very boring after 45. broken crafting system (armor).broken dungeon loot system (worse then russia or any other region. takes weeks to get 1 armor piece).broken pvp system (can't get into bgs half the time).broken economy (restricted sales values on market make it impossible to sell items).broken economy part 2. abusers or hackers left with all their goods that flood the market. you can't make money.reports and videos of hackers abusing old bugs which were known from other versions.poor communication with devs after a few weeks into launch.finally, in my own oppinion, the game is just boring. i tried to love it, i gave it around 150+h og gaming time looking for nostalgia i felt in other regions but it just ended up giving me a sour taste of being scammed. it might change but at the moment the game is not fun. would refund if could.",0

7261,"played this game long before it came on steam.if you are fed up with hearthstones limitations and money grabbing then you won't find a better alternative in elder scrolls, for that you willl need to look at spellweaver.the same goes for gameplay, they tried to be different with lanes, but they forgot everything else. what makes a card game great is gameplay and the ability to enjoy it in a balanced environment. elder scrolls does not offer this at all. in fact it is the same old crap, where players who have played more or payed will have the advantages. leaving you with a terribly unsatisfying choice of buying your way through or leaving the game or painfully grinding as fodder for other players who paid.at least in spellweaver you can grind cards vs the ai to get your collection up before facing people, in elder scrolls, this is not an option. so you will be faced with the decision to either get smashed vs people or pay.the free campaign offered a really nice introduction into the game and if only the momemtum could have continued from there. but it didn't, the fun abruptly ends when the campaign ends, and you realize the pay wall between you being able to continue to play more campaign or becoming competitive. the alternative is playing the ai for no relevant collection reward or doing the solo arenas that increase in difficulty without an equally scaling of draft choice strength.the game desperately wants you to pay money, that is the sad part, it just isn't worth it. unless you somehow fall in love with the gameplay, but in my opinion there isn't enough in this game to differentiate it from other card games. so because of this, would rather enjoy another card game like spellweaver that actually has many more advantages to this or other card games. would recommend you play that instead. if you really want to play a solid card game. go with spellweaver.",0

4416,"winning or losing is entirely determined by your connection error, or rather the server's connection which is so flimsy it could go either way. the game lags and has a lot of talking npcs and unncessary click steps yet has a timer. which means they must've intended the game not to be played as yugioh, but as a completely arbitrary gamble and the yugioh cards are there for aesthetic and to trick idiots into buying gems.overall it is more balanced than real yugioh, but that's because real yugioh is everything you should not do in a card game. with so much dependent on first hand cards, spells/traps only existing as complimentary utility, and a lot of power creep from set to set, it wasn't hard to make this game at all more competitive by just tightening the board and changing set rotation down to hand selected cards that aren't all that good in the real format. what this is, is yugioh where they only correct their own bad game design by limiting cards that broke the real game as either extraordinarily rare (again, to trick idiots) and leaving the meta complete hogwash because of consistency constraints and tight board management making a lot of archetypes obsolete.yugioh as a game is all about the rareity and power creep of a card, so in essence this fixes that by makingservers that run on a atari 500 and insuring most players never even see the really broken stuff they've made over the years. but if you're expecting to duel hardcore, make friends, do really anything besides wait around for the server to crash and get a loss for it... you'll need to play another card game. which i can't even recommend to you one because the industry is just so unconcerned with improvement and actually in-depth gameplay they're all just as bad. if i could give it a rating instead of just a recommendation i'd rate it two stars because it's like some evil genie wish of technically fixing yugioh, but in the most contrived way possible. it's like these programmers work harder to aggravate and troll than they do making a game.",0

1035,"!!warning!! if you are not aware of it being in a alpha state. please realize, before you buy. this game is in a infant state.thanks.early access thoughts:i must say that i have participated in a few early access games. for the amount of content that is available, at this very moment, is already worth my 10$.1: detailalready in its early state, fractured space has some good eye candy. there is some things that are placeholders, im sure. but, so far, it is very nice looking. the ship explosions are some of the best i have seen for a space game. it looks just as i would think a explosion in space would look like. the asteroids look quite well done. (i am hoping that the main base doest stay like it is. looks more like a fighting ring, than a main base..lol) 2: shipsthey are going for more of a team play mechanic. so you have your heavy, med, and light crafts. then you have some different roles tied into the ships as well. from a sniper, to a close up run and gunner. plus there is support class ships. like a healer, and one that can disable a enemy. very versitile, and logical, how the dev's have planed so far. 3: game playyou have two teams. fighting for control of five sectors. (which is quite large) two home bases, that are the primary capture point. the ships fly by using w/a/s/d/q/e.(sitting still will get you killed..lol) space bar will raise you, while ctrl will lower you. you aim, zoom in(like ads), and scroll in and out to zoom, with your mouse. there is a health bar on the hud, around the cursor/reticle. your abilites are on the numbers. you hold shift to pick a near jumpoint. (the animation for the jump does need some work. which im sure that they will) some ships cature points quicker than others. so finding the right balance for your play still shouldn't be too hard. now, in these five sectors of the map; there are mines to capture in the two lanes of alpha and beta sectors, which in turn will add resources for your team. these resources will compile, and add the ability to upgrade your ships damage/defence/mobility/and capture rate. the more resources a team has, the more upgrades to the teams ships. (so capture those points!!) there are four main points of capture, in alpha and beta secors.(on each side of the map) with three mines in both sectors. one large gas plant in the very middle. it is gamma sector. (but on the map, it is c, not g..bugs me..lol) the gas plant does not come online untill 10 min of the match has past. and two main bases at the very top and bottom. i'll be honest, i don't know if it's possible to win by resources, or points. but, i do know that capture the enemies base will win the match. ui: can be a pain a little. but seeing how new this is, i did expect worse. it isnt that it is placed in a wrong spot. but, for instance; when fighting, my abilites are on the numbers 1-7(i think..lol could be 8) anyway, i want to keep flying, to make myself a harder target, and trying to do that, aim and shoot, then hit an ability without letting off the throttle, can be a pain..lol (to be fair, i cant think of it being much different. untill we can set buttons to what we want.) there is very little else i can say, as there isn't much in it at the moment. but, if you like sci-fi, and space shooters. then, this one is going to be good when finished. and, if you like to alpha test, then you should go ahead and spend the 10. either way, you can get 10$ worth of fun out of it, in its alpha state. in my oppinion, of couse.[edit] i have reinstalled this again..so much better! i might be willing to throw a few more dollars at it now..:)",1

15699,"this game is fun with a very supporting community online. it's one of the few games where it actually takes a long time and dedication to get the many powerful weapons, so farming for items will be one of your main points into getting stronger in the game. this game is great, but sometimes it's hard to discern if the items you're using is actually affecting the enemy because the stat differenes aren't that large (dealt 8-9 damage to an enemy with a weapon with +15 attack, did the same amount of damage with a weapon with around +29 attack). overall, i found this game pretty fun.",1

14804,"returned to robocraft after a year to find many changes - many of which initially excited me, but then after a number of games realized that balance of weapons is still sorely lacking. i read how the developers want to move to a horizontal progression scheme, and while i agree with this move in theory, in practice it still amounts to a grind to attain what are currently the best weapons.previously, the game had a kind of rock/paper/scissors balance between different types of bots, but they recently changed it so that you can use multiple types of weapons on a single bot. in theory, this should be exciting, but there were many balances that had been calibrated by the previous 2 years of development that were trampled on by this change. despite the developer saying that they wanted to balance weapons, making even lower quality weapons effective depending on player design, in practice they are not.matches now are dominated by users with long range missiles and close range shotguns, both of which cost an arm and leg in terms of play time to acquire. every other weapon is of such reduced value that most of my previous builds were rendered virtually ineffective. despite having played over 200 hours of this game in the past, acquisition of the new weapons looks to be very tedious - too tedious to hold my interest in returning to the game.",0
10964,"this game has a lot of potential, but it hamstrings itself with a series of deck-building rules that i struggle to see as anything other than a cash-grab. i'll lay it out short and sweet: you get cards by playing the two draft modes, either against ai for 2500 gold or against players for 5000 gold. in order to get gold to play draft modes, you either play ranked matches (slow) or play against ai (fast if you win reliably). the ai only pays off if you can reliably win 7 games.now here's the problem: your deck is unplayable unless it consists of 33% mana and a minimum of 75 cards, or 50 cards and 25 mana. that's a large enough percentage that you /will/ run in to situations where you get mana starved or mana flooded - either you have a hand with 3 mana and all your cards cost 4+ to cast or you have a fistful of mana and nothing else. now, will this happen every game? of course not! a well-balanced deck with a good mix of cards will only be left helpless at the mercy of rng occasionally. however, anecdotally, it feels like it happens at least once every 7 games, and there's no option to design your deck in such a way that you can eliminate this problem and get more reliable results. sometimes you just draw 6 mana sources from turns 15 through 21 and watch yourself lose the game despite playing to the best of your ability, and the frustration when that happens on game 7 of a gauntlet run spoils the rest of the gameplay. this enforced lack of reliability in a mode that dangles rewards over your head for winning consistently is a bad gameplay experience. it feels designed to tease people with the possibility of getting better cards without actually offering a realistic chance of doing so. this is the hook in eternal's free to play model - sure, you can play the game for free, if you're the sort of fortunate soul who can make a profit by buying boxes of magic cards and selling the foils for more than the cost of the box.",0

8826,"judging by this game's current situation, you can tell it was made by hi-rez. after having the unfortunate experience of playing this game for more than 2 rounds, you can notice a lot of things. for one thing, weapons are completely unbalanced. slug rifles, heirloom rifles, crossbow, and revolver are almost completely useless. the shotgun is also trash. the assault rifle and burst are long range and dont have damage fall off, and do more damage then they should. another thing about this game is it's bugs. all games have them, but here they are a dime a dozen. character glitches, map terrain errors, crashing for no reason. now you think that by now hi-rez would fix this, nope. they add a battle pass! much like paladins, hi-rez is more into making dough off of small children than fixing their own god damn game. and when they do add patches, they just the problems even worse! recently they made crafting legendary weapons and crafting in general cheaper to do, so all players have equal advantage. but the thing is, players have an equal oppurtunity of getting a legendary sword and getting a legendary assault rifle. my point is, being alpha gives no excuse to how this game is, dont buy it",0

7445,"i am disapointed but the new changes don't take away from the fact that this is still a great card game. i do not like the new ui look at all so i agree with that. everyone is upset at the new changes but they don't realize that they are turning away new players who may not care as much about the looks. i do think that the menus are more confusing, but i'm sure i'll get used to it. i hate the fact that now when i log on or look at the game in my steam menu that i see hot elf chick in bikini armor. i really hope that the character changes often because i don't want to play a game if it's going to be covered in hot chicks it's 2018 we are over this stuff. and it looks like those crappy web ads for the mobile games. anyway, i hope there was a good reason for changing how the board looks. to be fair, i do like the look of the cards (after some getting used to) and the player decks on the table are a nice touch. and the new borders around the player icon with the runes looks cool. the mana ring now looks like crap. it looks cheap, like 2001 graphics. and the blank table does not look good. how can you go from playing on an elder scroll with cool images that changed to a blank table with not very good looking wood grain?? the game board feels too squished like there is no distance between the players boards. i also think the moths need to be fixed. they look cheap and out of place, when those moths are super cool and legendary in es. the table looks too crowded, the soul gem on the table looks cheap. i don't mean to go on but these things mean a lot when you are looking at them for a long time and trying to concentrate on your game. i still love the game and do recomend it. but the dev's need to reach out and let us know that they aren't going to let the game be ruined. people have spent money and time to unlock cards. it would break my heart to have to quit playing altogether. but it is not at that point yet! keep playing! let the devs know that we care.",1

5532,"world of tanks blitz is largely the same as world of tanks, which can be counted as a older brother to blitz. gameplay wise is quite similar with the older patch of world of tanks physics, gun shoot sounds, armour profiles and etc. both of them are f2p and grinding the top tier 10 tank without any premium tanks or premium account is possible as long as one plays smart and saves credits.compared to warthunder, blitz falls on the arcade type of game which is much easier to play and master than warthunder due to the more smaller learning curve, although warthunder gives a higher sense of pleasure after you have fully mastered it.the rather major difference compared to world of tanks is the lousier graphics which means a better frame rate for slower computers. also, one will note that unlike world of tanks, blitz does not have artillery or self-propelled guns because of its smaller map size, faster gameplay and shorter match time which makes implementing arty impossible. then people will ask: will the developers implement artillery into the game next time? the answer is no, unless they make special matches with longer match times and bigger maps which i think is not going to happen. another point to note is that its faster gameplay makes tanks with a certain amount of mobility play more aggressively and become able to keep up with the pace of the battles much easier.overall, if you are looking for a quick multiplayer tank game that is easier to play than world of tanks, then blitz is great for you. if you are a hardcore fan of tanks and would want to try something much harder, then warthunder(intermediate skill and f2p), steel armour: blaze of war(high detail and big learning curve, same for the other two listed) along with steel beasts and steel fury: kharkov 1942 are good games to try with thier higher realism.here are some tips for people who are starting in blitz.1. take a look at the tech tree and see which top tier tank is appealing to you. then plan which tank line you would want to take towards that tier 10 tank. note that some top tier tanks have only one tank line to choose.2. after that, i would recommend people grinding the russian medium tank line because they are rather easy and fun to play with. or you can choose a tank line which has tanks with good enough mobility like the is heavy tank line. you can also choose not to grind any russian tank if you prefer sniping(germany) or would rather be a jack of all trades(us). it is the best to avoid the british tank line because they are one of the hardest tanks to play in my opinion.3. dont use premium ammunition(as in ammo that can be bought for credits but in a very large amount of credits compared to your standard ammo either because they have higher penetration against armour or deals more damage against enemy tanks) unnecessarily but only use it when you cannot penetrate the enemy tank with standard ammo and etc. also, dont buy provisons and camouflage for a tank you are using it to grind a hefty amount of credits as the result would most likely be a loss of credits or only a few hundred plus credits even if you had a great battle.4. lastly, have fun and dont get angry about a match. if ever in a bad mood, take a break and play again later. this can help you concentrate and perform better in battle.5. dont forget to learn techniques to use your tank more effeciently. you can find that out with the forums or youtube videos. world of tanks forums and videos also applies to blitz.",1

11979,"the good:there's enough basic goodness here in combat and basic game structure to recommend the gameplay. while nothing entirely original here, it seems like a good foundation for later expansion. currently five of the seven classes are unlocked, and the level cap seems to be 45 with an additional 20 levels for new tactic levels. tactics are basically skill trees that you can switch between on the fly in combat. graphics wise, this is nothing special. utilizing unreal 3, this looks a bit dated (think tera as the closest thing i can compare it to graphics wise). it is decently presented though, with enough background stuff going on to feel like a somewhat believable world. it does have some of the asain mmo staples like auto-pathing and badly dubbed cut-scenes for the dramatic moments. but i've seen a lot worse.the not so good:i have a fairly beefy system, an i7 8800k and a gtx 1080, and i was having some frame-rate issues even using the frame-rate unlock found online. turning down the graphics to accomidate the loss of frames isn't the end of the world because the game still looks pretty good on mid-settings.the bad:two days and getting into the game is hit or miss. i have frequently been a victim of the loading screen of death. basically the initial bless splash screen fails to connect to the server selection/character selection screen. meaning you have to restart again and again and again (and a few more times) to some times get lucky and into the game. until this one bug is fixed i cannot recommed this to anyone. when it is resolved, i would probably say it's worth checking out if your are looking for a solid if somewhat middle of the road mmo.",0

1406,"a decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small, rather hostile, playerbase with limited variety.good:gameplay (overall) is really good. the ships are slow and require some patience. they are supposed to be big hulking capital ships. the combat is pretty good as well. bad:variety. 2 modes, conquest and frontline. conquest has 2 lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes. frontline is... basically the same thing, but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic. so, you have 2 modes that both have the same/similar mechanics and objectives. if you don't like one mode, you won't like the other. ships (stealth). some ships have stealth, which, in and of itself, isn't a bad thing. the problem is that they drag the game down and are just unfun to play against. games like dota2 do stealth right, where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves (which this game has) but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes (which this game doesn't have). so, if the enemy team drafts a team (you can't switch ships mid match and you can't see what the enemy is bringing) and you don't have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill, you are sol. double (or tripple) the frustration when compared to dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be. it's just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you can't see the enemy's draft but no option to counter if you don't draft one of those few counter ships yourself. sound. game audio is mediocre. ship fire sounds rather lackluster. playerbase. it's no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players. the problem is that in the few recent pvp matches i've played, people are rather hostile. that might not be an issue if the game had a decent playerbase, but if you run into someone you don't like, be prepared to see them in the next 20 matches because odds are you'll fight them again and again. beyond that, finding a match, for me, has taken everything between 1 minute and 10. grind. unlocking ships doesn't seem so bad but i also bought into the game's early access and so had a lot of credits stored up. however, ships range between 300k credits and ~1mil credits while you earn about 10-15k each match. it just feels like too much of a grind for me, and that's before you buy the sidegrades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have. menu. omg i hate the menu system in here!!! such a pain to visit the hanger and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it. there are some filters, but they don't help as much as you'd think. overall, the menues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming.overall, the gameplay is good, but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions.",0

6359,i have played this game for a while now and i am a light tank commander which isnt to bad just somewhat underpowered how it should be against tanks. against infantry its quite strong which is good but the second i join as infantry you always get killed by people with fully upgraded weapons for example the m1/m2 carbine of the us is way to overpowered. i see it being used alot and i myself use a ppd-40 semi upgraded. no matter if i have the jump on him he just turns around and shoots 10 bullets in 1 second killing you because i have a slower fire rate. this is mostly done by paying for the game because progress is just painfully slow. i try my best to get a better medium tank but the last 2 unlocks i have to get are going so damm slow because you mainly fight against stronger medium- heavy tanks while we usually only have light tanks that can sometimes penetrate the medium tanks but that takes so many shots that it just doesnt matter since they 2 shot us no matter where they hit us. the game is just almost forcing you to pay for the game to have a good chance against your enemies,0

2023,"path of exile has been almost nonstop fun since i picked it up in closed beta at the end of 2011. i've put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit steam. if you like diablo, you will likely enjoy poe. this is the spiritual successor to diablo 2. prepare yourself though - this isn't as simple as diablo 3, and requires a lot more planning, thought, and testing to have an effective build.math of exile is a game where you afk in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how you're going to set up your future passive skill points. the mechanics of combat, damage, and character resources (health, mana, energy shield, armor, etc) are very well thought out and make for strong arpg combat, as a spiritual successor to the diablo line should be. early game (the first ~19 levels) has a little more variety than d3 per character, but after level 19 your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills, provided you can get them from a master or another player, or find them as drops. gameplay is varied, but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running grs over and over. i personally find poe's grind more fun because there's more i can do while grinding, and there's a large, active community in each league, and i can chat and get responses and conversations at any time.overall it's a modern diablo 2 experience, with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than d2, but in each respect is more rewarding than d3's more loot, less gameplay twist on the diablo recipe.you will be tested, and you will be found wanting. just try to survive.edit: how many expansions in are we now? four? four free expansions, three of which are more content rich than the d2 expansion, and all of which have more content than diablo 3's xpac. seriously, give this game a go. it's free, it's fun, it's awesome.",1

2207,great game for those who want to be reminded of the diablo ii glorious days with possibly infinite customization to skill/talent/progression system and aside from the 10! acts(i mean what hack n slash game gives you a 10 act story mode and for free!) alongside with the pvp mode you get end game content that gives you countless hours of top tier raid maps for completion in a unique mode that can be played solo or with other players.some minor bugs include server lag as it seems it became quite popular and servers cannot handle the player base and some memory leak loading issues that can be frustrating.excellent !!! 9.5/10---edit--- one year later---their ing net code is total t . there are instances of playing through a big pack and you auto attack in a direction and their ing server doesn't understand that you just auto-attack and your player just decides to run inside the pack and you get one shotted.imagine now trying to do a labyrinth where you have only one chance to complete it and the ing game kills you even when you have avoided aoe on the ground or you die from completely nothing cause just like that . you path of hentai the devs everything this game stand for.,1

14333,"i've been playing this game on another platform in case anyone is wondering why i only have so few hours played.this is just my opinion on the game, the devs, and the situation based on my perspective as a player:after months of unsatisfaction and hope that things would get better, i have to warn people that this game is pretty much a scam.the game hasn't received a proper update in over a year. important bugs and ui issues still haven't been fixed, problems that make the game tedious, frustrating and boring haven't been addressed, no new features were added to make things interesting...meanwhile the devs did two things:1) they promised content, fixes, updates, etc.2) every month, they released 3 packages at $15 a piece that were way overpriced for what they did (even $5 would be expensive, imo).people have been buying these time-limited packs because they thought improvements were coming soon. instead, the devs just made empty promises. they made polls on the forums to pretend that they wanted feedback, they published lists of stuff they were supposedly working on, they made excuses every week for unexplained delays, they blamed most of the situation on the community manager and replaced her by someone who just apologized more for delays... in other words, they did everything they could to save their reputation despite not actually doing anyting good for the game.a few weeks ago they also started to lock critical topics on the forum and they deleted old topics where they promised more content. it's kind of funny, i thought this would happen so i kept screenshots of these things... i guess i have enough experience with dishonest developers and their money-grabbing tactics to see these things coming.the worst they did is that they even banned one of their loudest critics and top players from the whole game for racism, for jokingly referring to the chinese company owners as our chinese overlords. as if it wasn't bad enough, from what i've been able to understand that comment was made in a private discord channel. the forums mysteriously became much less critical after that, everyone obviously started to worry about their game account getting banned for made-up reasons. long-time contributors to the community, who had special status on the forum acknowledging their efforts, also mysteriously lost that status after criticizing the game and became less vocal about their complaints.well, recently the devs anounced that they hadn't been working on any of the things they promised. instead, they had spent all their time making the game available in china. they said the promised fixes, improvements and additional content would come later, and they released 3 more packs at $15 a piece anyway.the thing is, i don't think any fixes, improvements or content are coming. they pretty much lied for months about working on this when it's now clear they weren't, so i think they don't plan to work on it at all, they're probably just trying to sell as many packs as possible until the game stops making enough money.so my advice: don't spend any money on this game. it's overpriced, the devs are lying about working on content, they censor criticism, and they try to hide the old promises they made. the content you can buy is overpriced, it will take you a very long time to use it due to broken game mechanics, and it's very unlikely that things will ever get better.it's one thing when devs make plans for new content, but then unexepected stuff happens and they can't finish the work. it happens. but in the case of shop heroes, it seems they never had any serious plans to begin with, despite saying otherwise. and that's not acceptable at all.you've been warned.",0

771,"i have no idea why the dev released this game in this state. its broken. period. weapons are not balenced. serers are extreamly laggy. the only redeaming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store, you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disatvantage. was this game fun? yes it was. does that mean its a good game? no.-=gameplay=-this game makes me think of counter-strike and cod had a baby and somehow that god aweful game combat arms also came in. it plays alot like counter-strike, you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points. but the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill. not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights. there is only 1 u.s server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap. now dont get me wrong, i did enjoy some of the matches. but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are un-exseptable. the maps feel bland. you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be. but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action. spawn camping is another big problem. if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped. -=sound=-the game tends to be glitchy at times. the guns also dont sound all that amazing. the music you here when you start up the game is nice. but after that is all guns. and thats fine...if the guns were nice to hear. -=community=-with this being a pure online based game i have to adress community. the community is...there. but its not booming. i havent seen too much hacker name calling while in a game as of late. but when thegame was first released, it was somthing you saw alot.-=free or pay2win=-this game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar. but theres no guns,ammo,or anything that would make it pay 2 win. what is there is slight cosmetic gear. such as face pain and masks. -=graphics=-the graphics are not anything new, exciteing, or all that special. but they are not the worst. i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good. -=final verdict=-this game is fun, and with more work could be great. but at its current state i just cant reccomend it. the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own servers/games and let others join. that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers. the final verdict is a 3.75/5.0 (okay)",0

(tl;dr) dota 2 is definitely worth picking up and learning if you have the time commitment to do so, especially now more than ever as the devs have made it easier for newcomers to learn the basics of the game; accompanied by the new-and-improved matchmaking system. however, be wary that the community, regardless of which server you are in (im looking at you sea servers) contains plenty of salty and toxic players.9/10",1

2778,if you want to play this game pay up because its not free. the progression is painfully slow and the matchmaking is very bad. you got high tier opponents in almost every match. i love this game but the cash grab is ruins everything. the fun is killed in this game and i have no interest paying for a company that uses these disgusting metods.,0
12437,it is an amazing game but no game ever should have $78.95 worth of dlcs thought. so on that basis it is not that great of a game because it is on the right track but it is not entirely free in the long run if you get the dlcs for the game,1

60,"i wouldn't necesarily say i recomend this game fully. the gameplay is very basic, progression from going room to room gets old, and it's not the most terrifying game to hardened horror fanatics. but, if you got some time to kill, it's a fun distraction in short bursts.the game is very emersive. the ambience is very well done, the sound design alone really makes you feel like you're trapped miles below ground in a endless maze. the humor is very entertaining and quirky, which is probably the strongest point of the game. the jumpscares in the name sake aren't the main point of horror. instead, they're really kind of the joke of the game. when a real threat shows up, it actually doesn't resort to jumpscares. and the monsters are varried enough to keep it suspensful when you're locked in a chase.the only downside, once again, is that it can get old really fast. basically you just walk room to room. every now and then you'll read some notes that parody the ones in other cliche horror games. and the jumpscares get more and more sillier. but, sometimes it can feel like a real chore to play this game during long periods. and i have no real interest to go back and find out how to get the good ending, nor do i really want to spend any money for the dlc. but, all in all, it's kind of fun to switch on every now and then when i want something spooky, but not too spooky.",1

8238,"i've played this game for a while and i have to say, that many negative things in negative comments are true:- endgame pvp is full of players who spend way too much money in a game and just destroy you (there are some guys out there who are stronger then your whole team)- you really need only 3 classes: control wizard, great weapon fighter and only sometimes a devoted cleric- the game repeats over and over again in the endgame because of campaigns and the same dungeons over and over again- you often end up exploiting bugs in some dungeons and run them over and over again -> grinding as f***please notice that i'm not familiar with the books etc. i just started it because a good friend told me about it. but there are some really good aspects in the game:+ it looks nice+ the gameplay is really nice and just makes fun+ the music is nice+ real fun with some friends+ nice map/dungeon design+ theoreticly you can reach everything without spending any money, but it would take waaay too long+ pve is not pay2win+/- the community: on one side, they throw you out of the group because you don't have a 15.000+ gearscore (shows how good your equipment is) - on the other, they'll help you and share their experience+/- updates: the game develops more and you get more and more content - but with every update there is at least one new way to exploit a dungeon+/- boss fights: many of them are unique and are really great ! - but after the 5. to 10. time you kill the same boss, you'll know how to kill him easily+/- the zenshop: the zenshop is a place where you can buy stuff with zen, you get them for real money. in this shop you can't buy any equipment but wards, and you'll need those wards for your enchantments.all in all i can say that i had fun playing this game and i will play it further because after every dungeon you finish, after every boss you kill and after every step you advance you make in the campaigns, you'll feel better and you can see how you develop your character. if you have another opinion pls share it in the comments below. it's a game worth a try because it's free2play :3",1

10214,"once you get over the fact that this game is not in spirit a, free to play, it is one of the best hunting simulators in current day. you have to buy a basic membership if you plan on enjoying this game. so you have all licenses & ammunition without either expiring. in hindsight, the membership is actually cheaper then your average mmorpg, which charges you at average $15 a month. thehunter only asks for $31 for the entire year. or if you want extra stuff to work with, $50 for the trailrunner, and you can keep everything in the package even after it expires.the animals do not interact with each other realistically like in deer hunter season 2005, but even with that, the game is still extremely enjoyable especially in its multiplayer. making new friends in this game is very easy and motivates you to hunt newer species, explore more of the reserves, and try out different ways of hunting.also, this is not a run & gun arena shooter game like call of duty. so if you have the patience span of a gnats d*ck, you'll hate this game.so understand specifically that this is not a total free game. but the asking price is not terrible either especially with the content that can be explored. buying things in the game is optional. some things you do need but can buy in packs.duck hunting you do need the callers or you cannot hunt ducks. camoflauge plays a big deal in it too. so if you plan on spending money in spots for different hunting, then plan out where you'll spend it without going broke. manage your cash, is all i can tell you.so, give thehunter a chance. or if you're too broke then you will not be able to enjoy this game.",1

1515,"the games fun, behaves much like a moba and has good handle for a game in early stages of alpha, graphics are rather incredible even on medium settings.but there is one thing, there are some balancing issues that needed to be fixed, other wise the player base is just not going to grow positively a few of these examples in clued stuff like the sniper ship (long range is fun, but there is a point when that range can be rather unfair, such as when no one can reach the guy piloting said sniper ship causes he is practically out of the map and out of reach of primary weaponry and drone abilities), and the ability for people to warp out while in the middle of combat with no way to stop them from doing so (oh so many times i'd start fighting a flagship and it begins home warp as soon as the first shot(s) land on it. you gotta take a lump or two children, this game isn't for those who don't wanna get hit)i feel the game has much potential as long the dev team just rub out these issues and balance it out a bit as well with any future content they put out, i rather like it as it fits my genre of games (spacy, futuristic), but since they got some rough spots in the balancing of game play i can't really rate this game fully until i see if the devs do said balancing or see if they just don't care, hopefully they will care, i hope they do certainly, games so much fun when you actually get a good fight going as i'v had battles last for at least 2 hours. for now though this game gets a yes.(come on developers, don't disappoint us here! weer counting on you to make good decisions here! )",1

7016,"this is basically a hearthstone rip off will elder scrolls lore. that doesn't mean it's bad though. listing the pros:elder scrolls: legends allows more freedom when it comes to deck building, no need to restrict yourself to 30, instead, you can have a max of 70 cards if you want. the art is really nice, and the plethora of cards you can make and get equal nearly unlimited deck building.thats mostly where my compliments for this game ends.this game is not heavy on ptw in my opinion, however, it is highly rng based. you play a 10 minute game, successfully put up guards, lethals, charges, (those are types of cards) whatever you may want, only to go from about 25 to 30 health to 0 to -10 in a matter of 2 turns. people in this game either play extremely defensively to the point that you're fighting an indestructable turtle, or they play hyper aggressive with lethals and vampire cards.now that i got the salt out of my system from losing 4 consecutive matches with a strength/willpower deck to a bunch of agility/endurance decks (good luck beating them), this game is all and all basically just hearthstone with more depth and more freedom. if you like that, play it.oh and this game is free, which is nice.",1

6361,"heroes and generals is now out of early access, so lets take a look!excellent foundation, good technical achievements, incredibly poor design choices and missing management.that about sums it up. but lets elaborate on that.the foundation of the game- the battles themselves as infantryman are good. vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal. the physics and gun system are good, once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game, and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs. but then there are things missing, and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for. prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective, and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point.flanking works well, you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms, but this is not really used that much. you can use it all, be the ultimate soldier, and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets. there is no penalty for dying- not for you at least, but more on that later, and you don't really get rewarded for anything you do either. you play to play, and you win because you want to win.then lets get right to the poor design choices. this game is not just pay to win, but pay to progress. the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game. do you want to group up with a few friends? if there's more than two, then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the 'skill' of having a group. after that, prepare for a lot more grind, as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier. and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades, you're going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications, because every single bullet shot, grenade thrown, mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot. this leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentality;life is cheap. ammo is expensive.if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because 9 times out of 10 it will be better than yours, even if you've spend 50+ hours on the game.of course there are other issues, mainly around balance and the 'generals' portion of the game. i'll spare you the complaints on balance- it's the usual for pay to win games, but more on that other bit later.that said, if you don't mind the grind, and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours(10+) the basic infantry combat is good stuff. moving along to tanks you will find that they're not amazing, but certainly entertaining and useful. your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well. airplanes are a joke and they likely always will be, do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them. controls are awful, planes don't do anything, and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful. prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything.and then on to the big complaint with this game, when you're not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money. the generals part.it may as well not exist.the game may even be better if it did not exist.the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable.first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it. then you will need to spend 3+ days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them. they will die in about 5 minutes and they will have gained no experience. everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the devs money for it, which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them. the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy- merely people throwing their units around hoping it works. sometimes it does work too, but this is never because of any skill at command.it all comes down to the people playing the war battles. and they don't care. people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at. because they don't have to pay for those tanks. the guy who got the tank brigade does. same for airplanes, infantry spawns and vehicles. why would they care that you've waited 3 days to get your infantry squad filled? they will run into machinegun fire and then respawn to do it again until you lose your squad. they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have 1000 infantry spawns and 300 vehicle spawns and they fight 160 infantry and 10 vehicles. and because these vehicles despawn after use, they are gone and they remain gone. the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics, a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game.and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun. a game with great ideas, pretty good technical achievements, but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesn't care either. greed above all else, and a complete lack of awareness.long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept, good basic gameplay, and claimed to have plans to make it better. i wanted to support them, since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great.i regret that.i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use. the game isn't better than it was back then. it's worse, and it's showing no signs of ever improving.",0

2779,"i recommened and don't recommend war thunder for several reasons. 1. the grind.i have invested a decent amount of hours, i haven't gotten to the jet tier. i had just started the tier right before. inorder for me to research a new attacker, fighter, bomber, etc. i need to invest several games worth. my average rp (research points) ranges from 100-200 in losses and 600+ depending on kills, majortiy of matches i complete are rewarding me with 1000 rp. a bomber that i'd like to research requires 75,000 rp...that's 75 matches in order to complete one plane, thats just the avg. rp gain of 1000, so not every match will give me 1000. a fighter is 30,000. 30 matches or more or less. now the grind at first was fun, the first 3 tiers were very enjoyable for tanks and planes, but i can't stand playing long matches and getting barely enough rp to get a new plane. by this rate i'll get the jets in a few months if i play to my own leisure. 2. the urge to pay for gege (golden eagles) are premium currancy. you can instantly research and purchase planes, tanks, and modifications with them. i have spent roughly $10 on war thunder, that isn't too bad considering that $6 gives (i'm assuming around) 1,000 ge. well as you go down the plane or tank branchs you notice the rp gets higher, the more rp the more ge it takes to instantly research or aid the research. not only is does ge just finish or aid research, you can use your ge to activate a premium account for 'x' amount of days according to your ge amount. when you have a premium account your awards are nearly doubled/you get more rewards then the usual. i personally feel like there is a large urge to purchase these ge in late game progress; however, it is a f2p game so i can't really complain.3. constant updates.something is too weak, something is too strong. now let's reverse it and see what happens. i have always enjoyed flying the p-47d, which was a american bomber hunter fighter. as a bomber hunter (interceptor) you spawn near your own bombers. well the p-47d is now a fighter and i have to take off the air strip, i can't provide my friendly bombers with a escort or attack the enemy bombers. by the time i'm at the alt. of 3k or 4k we already have a base or two gone. as it may seem that i'm just complaining about my issue, that isn't the case. many planes and tanks are being constantly nerfed or buffed, this may sound good and on some level, it is. but this causes the balance and meta to constantly change. for example: a german bf109 could have used to fear a american p-47d (which was usually never the case), well next week it could be reversed. 4. the communitythe community in war thunder, least from my experiences, is really great. majority of people are helpful and kind. this is most likely one of my favorites of war thunder. war thunder is a f2p game that is worth a try, if your willing to put in the hours and rack up kills, then you'll thrive in this game. the ge are not to pricy at times, the community is good, when they release big updates it's always exciting (like they're new one 'project x'). i generally think war thunder could improve in many areas, but i also think war thunder is doing good at where it's at and what it's doing. yet, in the end i do have to not recommend this game due to how bothersome the grind is.",0
14625,"no limit on blocks required for some guns makes the balance terrible.if you enjoy one shotting someone from the sky, while being unreachable this is for you.if you enjoy tactical play avoid.side note: for items to be made, the game requires you to sell (recycle) items you gain at the end of matches out of random loot boxes. this wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the loot wasn't cubes that sell for 1 of the ingame currency (even if you get a diamond box, purple and gold loot sell for 200-500). oh yeah .. top guns cost 142,000 of said currency per 1 ...this used to be such a good game. i have around 2000 hours off steam via the standalone, i downloaded it and played for a bit just to tell you all its complete .",0
4093,"after spending countless hours into this game, i feel i am ready to give my side of a review.yugioh has been a trend ever since the anime show of yugioh, plus people (like us) duel with cards like in this game. it's a very fun concept duel where player vs another player duel against each other, using monsters, traps, and spell cards. it's one of those games that makes it very fun to play and still. this game is originally from mobile. now i will get to the most detailed part:when you start the game, you have 2 legendary duelists you can start off with, seto, or yugi. picking any 2 doesn't impact further into the game, because you will eventually unlock more new legendary duelists by completing missions. what's great is most cards are very balanced, however, the downside is cutting 2 traps/spells, and 2 monster zones from the original mat, but you still have graveyard, field zone, extra zone for your fusion monsters.you can compete against the world, duel with your friends, buy card packs available to buy(hope you score better cards), customize your decks, your card and mat layouts. there's alot you can do. oh, did i mention you mobile users can transfter your data to your pc? well, now you can! if you don't wanna drain your phone battery by playing duel links, well, you can play it on your pc instead!in conclusion, i would truly recommend this game to any yugioh fans out there. despite not having 5 monster zones and 5 trap/spell zones, 3 each isn't half bad. give this game a try, you won't be disappointed!",1

11940,"i'll echo what many others are saying. no, just no. i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an mmo. but given that bless has been an ongoing project since 2012 and released in 3 regions prior to steam. there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years. trust me, save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first. ~60million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west...promotion/marketing- they advertised this game as local, optimized and new combat mechanism. upon 2-days early (of early) release this is not the case by a long shot. they marketed to your hype and released none of it. matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas. i get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better. optimzation is just not there...you have to edit your own ini files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine 3/dx9...yeah, a dinosaur. new combat! after many complained about the new combat beign removed (except for zerkers) to polish it more...this...this is not beign transparent after happily stealing dlc money. to make it clear, if they said it in advance, many wouldve been ok in waiting. emmisary event-was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release. emmisaries were youtubers to try/represent or even help hype the game. many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs. apparently some drama went down with them too. needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status. early 2day launch- needless to say that it was a waste of time. one thing is to wait in queue, another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line-to-wait. which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option. that's 2008ish issues. as of this post, its still iffy, believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation. collectors edition-skin/items are all character bound. no way to move them, no way to given them to an alt. with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join, good luck. your pack just got wasted. am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason. also the lumena in-game currency was character bound, they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more. problem here is, they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt...see a trend? in game they warn you its non-refundable! yeah right, people got their money back. nice try.servers- they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time. am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen. so while opening new ones are nice, it splits up pre-made guilds and your precious already burned founders items. poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here. planning of only 1 server vs oceanic, south america, north america, carribean...get the point?roadmap- they have a vague one laid out. most of it is the same from the 3 other regions. but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time. therefore many of earlier region content was striped away. here's the thing, when you meet a person and give that first handshake, that first introduction, it says alot about who you are. neowiz...who are you becoming? neowiz-overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work. do you know what they did differently? open forums, discussions, podcasts, whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with...transparency. warframe and ff14 are to name a few here. you have been hearing feedback, yes, but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you. come out of that closet, face us more often and get that feedback and just talk...talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship. also, lets say your afraid, you dont want to face an audience, then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with.in short, i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you (neowiz) make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention. at that point, what happens to you?should you prove to turn this around and do better, then ill update my review. just no until then, moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a non-refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried.original post may 30th.edit and follow up 6/6hmmm where to start. i still would'nt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone. make your own informed decision for what $30-$150 is worth to you. soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the game's release. from there a few patches, that as i mentioned above, catered to whomever yells the loudest. some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf. not to mention that each patch note doesnt include full disclosure still. for example, first two dungeons used to drop gear, guaranteed, each boss. now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have rng of a drop rate for rng of it beign of your class. events! boy are they throwing events left and right. the last gather/crafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or alt-bank. content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible. i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised. dx11 was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it. further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above. dupe items scandal. it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed. it demonstrates a rolled back build, further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content. not a full rework. ff14 went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell. as for those involved in the duping, few days ban and items were kept. so they say. apparently they are listening to feeback through their discord and with some emissaries. i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways. performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within 2 weeks. perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions. performance, performance, ~60 million later, perfomance...they already stole your money (and mine) with lack of transparency. whats a few please wait, more soon to make you more gullible?sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience (twitter, reddit). the fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could 1-shot things. now that adjustments make sense, no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo/links system works. its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down, read, practice. but they seem addicted to preference already.latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition. they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound. this on its own is unnecessary to founders. gold is account bound and am willing to bet that's an issue on the code, unintended. yet the in-game dollar-currency, lumina is not.",0

4531,"what is a moba?multiplayer online battle arenas, or mobas for short, originated as a sub-genre of the rts (real-time strategy) genre. because of this, in most moba games, the player takes control of a single character from the isometric (top-down) view akin to most rts games. typically, in moba games, a player takes control of a single character on one of two teams. those players choose characters that all have their own abilities, or kits. to win, the players must use a combination of abilities, teamwork, and strategy to not only best their opponent, but destroy the opponents main structures. a bonus to the genre is that most mobas are free games, which is definitely a contributing factor of the their massive success. the genre has many titles, the largest of which being defense of the ancients (dota) and dota 2, league of legends (lol), and most recently smite!what is smite?smite is one of the more recent free moba games to enter the fray. in smite you dont just choose a character, you choose a god. youll instantly feel an attachment to characters like thor and zeus because even if you dont know the lore behind them, youve at least heard their names before! what makes smite so immersive is hi-rez studios inclusion of historical lore into the gods abilities, kits, and play styles. thor and loki arent just characters from marvel comics and movies. theyre also a part of norse mythology and you can take control of them in smite!what makes smite different?smite takes all of the strategy of the top moba games and adds another layer of difficulty by putting you into the action! unlike most moba games, smite offers players the chance to experience the moba genre they know and love from a third-person perspective. this unique perspective allows for an extremely immersive experience unlike any other game in the genre. while this doesnt sound like such a big change, once you play it youll understand! all of these things added together is what has gaming websites everywhere continually rating smite as one of the best moba games available!",1

9353,"i really do need to play this game more to really explore whether or not i reccomend it. i'd feel bad leading people on that this is somehow a great game if it was only mediocre.one complaint i'd like to get out before i praise it, is the bureaucratic mess that is unlockable content. i am unsure how one earns those playable classes that remain behind a sealed window, and that's what turned me off to playing further than the 30 minutes o the first adventure i did. it wasn't that it was not fun, but i don't like being treated like a lab rat with prizes dangled in front of me i have to pay for. i'm paying enough investing time and effort. these games are hardly ever a breeze and more of a chore to get good at.but that's realm of the mad god's saving grace... is it doesn't really matter if you get good. in the end i don't think those unlockable classes would make much difference in game, as if you die, you die permanently. much like some of the first ever pc games that were dungeon crawls, and it gives it an 8-bit aesthetic that is both appealing, but also a little cumbersome at times to makeout where exactly the enemy is coming from. it isn't like my squinty filipino eyes were made for 5000fps bits of fireball spam.what the game does right, and few other games do is reward cooperation and ignoring competitiveness completely. there is no competition, you can't even make it so by player-killing, and i like that a lot. players are free to go their own way and die quicker if they so choose, but the real strategy is to stick together and make the most out of every player's utility.it is free, and because it's not some cut-throat pvp you should give it a try and decide for yourself since my gameplay amount is rather limited. but i might go back to it if i feel like i could get 100% of the experience at some point. again, my only real distancing came from the fact i felt like i was being scolded for being a freebie and couldn't have access to certain classes.",1

7371,"too many overpowered cards with ridiculous effects that instantly turn an entire game around just by getting lucky. luck plays too much of a factor for me to properly enjoy this game still. strategy and deckbuilding helps, no doubt. it's not *all* luck, but it is too prevalent for me to keep enjoying the experience. when a person randomly gets a prophecy card that instantly gives lethal, drain, guard, and other assorted unit passives to all their cards on the field, just by a pure luck draw, and then goes from slightly losing to having instant lane dominance, or blows away your entire advantage by wiping an entire lane without you being able to do anything about it whatsoever, that's when i say: enough is enough.other tcg's have game changing effects too, but then you are usually in a position to do something about it. trap cards in yu-gi-oh for instance can cancel magical effects that can turn a game around by having them on the field. es:l has no such thing. there is no protection against large scale effects with dramatic consequences, and thus it turns into who has the most op card in their draw/prophecy this time?you can't prevent someone from dropping a unit on the field that wipes something out. you can't stop someone from playing a spell that deals massive damage. you can't prevent someone from playing a luck prophecy by health loss via protective means. that last one also means that there is generally no reason not to play a prophecy for free because you're safe anyway.you can't place a card in anticipation of an event. you can't prepare yourself for what you expect the opponent to do. you can't play a card solely for the purpose of negating an enemy's potential comeback. you are playing your own game while praying to the nine that they don't draw or play something that wipes out your entire board or gives them some kind of advantage you couldn't prevent and it starts all over again.a comeback in this game will rarely ever come from planning and will mostly consist of luck because you as a player have such very limited means to respond to something.there need to be more measures that you can take to protect yourself from the large-scale effects of certain cards. without it, strategy will take a backseat to frustration as many powerful cards as possible are spammed because there is little danger in doing so. this is a sad consequence of the fact that there are absolutely no preventative cards in the whole game, besides guard units that can only stop direct attacks, which is not enough when the majority of the cards in the game are good because of their effects and not their attack strength.",0

1564,"(keep in mind i posted this just after i started playing) fractured space is a very enthralling masterpiece, that has some flaws which most certainly need to be worked upon.the great parts about fractured space are as follows: it's unique concept. fractured space at first just seems like a nerd's wet dream with collosal spaceship battles, lasers, and missiles. but the further you delve unto it's depths you realize it is much more. it has ties to common fps, moba, and startegy games that will bring in just about anyone that likes the styles of any game in those genres.fractured space has a good art style, by creating beautiful and haphazard looking spaceships. however these are not your average spaceship, as these are the motherships that you would typically deploy from in most other space dogfighting games. aditionally they are greatly balanced, and allow you to work amazingly together in teams.a couple of fractured space's flaws: lack of a playerbase to properly enforce the developers to work regularily and on more core gameplay features.additionally there is little to no balancing when joining a server. for example it is very common to be teamed against several very high levelled people.overall, in it's current st8 i would r8 a l8 8/12. could use some work, but very well established in it's current state already.",1

12748,"i probably had the less fun playing this game than any other racing game to date. i booted up the game and ended up waiting about 7 hours for the confirmation email to come so that i could activate my account and actually log into the game. this is the reason for my 8 hours of play time while i left the game minimized while waiting for the email to come. i was finally able to log in and was bombarded with the cluster-*** of a menu. there didn't seem to me to be any sort of rhyme or reason to how the menu was set up and the not-so-large amount of content was masked behind a seemingly endless menu, which was all locked behind a paywall anyway. once i got into what seemed to be the only track available to me, in what seemed to be the only car available to me, it took me a while to get used to not using a racing line in a game. after ten laps or so i was finally able to race around the track decently quick but was conitinuing to be annoyed by the way the game played. the physics seemed decent enough, but as far as being any fun.. it felt completely stale and uninteresting to me. the only track available for free didn't appeal to me at all and i didn't care too much for the car either. i was using a controller to race and the game still just felt really rigid, stiff and so unexciting that after a couple more laps i decided that i was done with it. the final product just felt to me.. well.. free. they put a lot of focus on making the game seem quite real. the game definitely has a unique feel to it that you notice all the way through, but i wasn't going to give any of it a chance when the racing itself just left me bored.it kinda feels like a free version of gran turismo. except.. not fun.. or good... from head to toe, it's just absolutely not visceral or exciting in the slightest.",0

4149,"a negative review on duel links? from someone with 50 hours in the game on steam alone, who has created a community guide and logged over 120 consecutive days in the past year on the mobile version? blasphemy!yeah, i know, but let me explain myself before you crucify me.duel links isn't a bad game. in fact, it's a great game that i've loved playing and that i've enjoyed from day one. despite the microtransactions and sometimes unforgiving meta, duel links has been arguably the best yu-gi-oh! game ever made, and konami has shown dedication to both supporting its players and to regularly updating the game with fresh and exciting content. as a whole, i applaud konami and what they've managed to accomplish in the year since duel links' global release.this review isn't about the quality of the game, though; rather, it's about my personal experiences playing duel links religiously for a year and why i've decided to take a step back from the game going forward. long story short? i think i've been addicted.i mean it when i said i've played this game religiously. that's the attitude that both the game and the community promote if you want to stay in the competitive scene and keep up with the constant barrage of new cards being added to the game. you are regularly encouraged to log on daily, spending a couple hours here and there to grind for xp and reach the max level with your duelists, which is the main way to earn the in game gem currency needed to buy more cards. you'll spend hours auto-dueling npcs while pretending you can focus on other tasks in between, when really your mind is preoccupied with how you'll soon have to queue up your next duel and how much longer it'll take you to reach the next level or stage.i got into this game because i loved yu-gi-oh! as a kid, and the idea of a free to play mobile game that was regularly updated and supported felt exciting and nostalgic beyond words. but i never expected to spend almost every day of the past year playing this game, or logging in for over 120 days straight, or how i would soon make excuses to play duel links when hanging out with my friends or going on coffee dates or even when just relaxing on the couch with my girlfriend. when the game is always in reach, your phone always nearby, it becomes so easy to log on to check on the cooldown on standard duelists, or to find yourself playing yet another pvp duel. people around me starting complaining, saying i was on my phone all the time, but i insisted it wasn't a problem and that i was still present and engaged in the conversations that would go on around me, even if it wasn't fully the truth. at work, at school, at home, on the bus - i played everywhere, anywhere.but venturing onto the duel links subreddit a few weeks back, i discovered that i wasn't alone in struggling to balance my time spent on duel links with my everyday life and responsibilities. so many other people have had these issues and multiple threads have been created to try and seek help from other players who didn't even know they shared these problems. duel links had become more than a daily routine for me, and these posts were a wakeup call: i had a problem.i'm still kind of taken aback by the whole experience, and i'm not expecting everyone here to understand, but as someone who's played video games all their life, i never thought a game could have the kind of hold on me that duel links has. i felt compelled to open the game daily; i had to so that i would continue my log in streak, so that i could continue to earn more gems so that i could feel like i was keeping up with other players. i hesitate to use the word addicted, but my duel links habit had become downright unhealthy.sunday was the first day in 123 that i did not log in to duel links. it was a normal, quiet afternoon. i went to starbucks, lounged around the house, played overwatch on my ps4. it wasn't until after midnight had passed that i realized i hadn't played duel links in 24 hours, and the understanding that my streak had ended and that i didn't have to log in every day anymore if i didn't want to was cathartic beyond words.i know that not everyone will experience duel links the same way, or the way that i have. i'm not going to stop playing altogether, either; i meant what i said about duel links being the best yu-gi-oh! game on the market, and i've met some amazing people in the community that i've bonded with over our ridiculous shared love for a children's card game.but since you can't leave a neutral review on steam, i have to give it a thumbs down, if just for the regret i feel knowing how much of the past year i spent glued to my phone. this isn't meant to discourage anyone from playing duel links, and as i've said, i highly recommend this game. but please, please be aware of how much time you spend on the game, and don't let it impact other areas of your life the way it impacted mine. it's okay to believe in the heart of the cards - just don't let them consume you.",0

12226,"**edit** 6/14/18 - please read this before reading below. i'm not going to delete my past review. i meant it when i wrote it. but my opinion has changed since. i no longer recommend this game. the developers do not listen to the community. let me start by saying, when the content creators the company chose can no longer be silent and they are making content about the giant flaws, you know it's not looking good. at first, we asked for more content. in response, we got 15v15 pvp (okay, cool), a promise for more content coming soon (cool), anddd a massive damage nerf across the board (what?!). i'll get back to that later.there were people duping items and people making ridiculous amounts of gold off of easy to farm materials that had a price that was literally 100x higher than other materials. these players ended up getting a major leg up on other players before these issues were fixed, but their gold and items seemed to still remain. there were rumors these players got anywhere from a 3-15 day ban, all the way to their accounts were deleted. regardless of what actually happened to them, this left the market in a terrible spot. trading was introduced... it doesn't work and wasn't mentioned in patch notes. we found it accidentallybut back to class balancing... the balancing after the first large nerf was shaky and it seemed like they were just letting loose reckless adjustments (not slight ones either), hoping that it would hit the mark and solve the problem. rangers got a ridiculous amount of cdr on skills, berzerkers = trashed, guardians = nerfed, paladins left with spitball damage and nothing but an inconsistent cc combo chain and a heal, and so on. some of us thought that getting our hands on current end game gear would help compensate for these nerfs, but that ended up being a dream that was swiftly crushed.players started getting to max level (45) and realized that the drop rates for the purple grade, level 45 gear are very small (something close to 5%). that sounds bad, but it's worse once you realize it's 5% just for a random class gear piece with a random rune slot to be shared by the whole party. we were told this was intentional, not a bug.these gear pieces dropped from the level 43 and 45 dungeons. the level 43 dungeon was insanely difficult post damage nerf. there is a bug that can cause infinite mobs to spawn if you wipe in a certain spot. final bosses enrage timer is notorious. beating this is the only way to get master crafting quest done. the 45 dungeon is easier than the 43, not even worth mentioning. but these dungeons can only be accessed twice a day, which means your grind for this purple gear is even more limited. since then, we have been begging for:- end game drop rates to be fixed- crafting materials to drop so we can craft blue grade, level 37 armor (we couldn't even get the material to craft it, which meant constantly running the level 37 dungeon until you got your entire set as drops), - runes (boost gear stats) to not all break on pve deathinstead, we got a new world boss and a silent nerf (was not mentioned in the patch notes) that took the set bonus from the level 45 purple grade gear and spiked it into the ground. i brought up this ninja nerf in the official discord and i was banned from talking because i was spreading rumors about the game. but other players started noticing and confirming the level 45 purple gear nerf and some of the officials in the discord went silent.now, you might ask: why are you upset? a new world boss? that's the content you had asked for in the beginning! well... optimization is still non existent, silent nerfs are a terrible business practice, and the world bosses drop trash (unless you're extremely lucky).there's a lot more. i had high hopes neowiz would turn things around, i tried to keep an open mind and embrace it as early access, but it's obvious they don't care.---5/28/18 - this is going to be a very long post. i'll start my review by saying this: yes, i recommend this game. i find the pieces that make it fun outweigh those that drag it down. if you're looking for an incredibly well polished ui/experience with perfect translations, this is not the game for you. here are pros, cons, recommendations for the developers, and a discussion.pros:- fun combat, the combo system feels nice imo.- very fun pvp. a guild mate and i accidentally started a faction war in an open area last night and spent two hours laughing while we and the union zergs kept going at it.- taming system is really fun. nothing like riding a giant caterpillar into battle.- large world.- dungeons are fun.- mix between pve and pvp is well done.- not p2w.- crafting and gathering is a rather smooth experience.- regardless of what everyone else is saying, the devs are trying. they just issued a public apology for the rough start and have been very on top of fixing issues. that alone is a pro that most people don't give credit for. yes, it's their job, but so many other early access games almost never make it to a full release and leave their product dead and unfixed. so props there.cons:- poor optimization (this can be easily fixed by editing an .ini file (the fixes are all over reddit, it's not hard to find)- very poor translations. - servers are somewhat unstable (supposed to be fixed during this maintenance).- market board is buggy. i would be more forgiving on this point if there were trading or another way to trade/sent items to friends and guild mates, but currently it involves: > one person posting an item on the market board for the minimum value allowed > a few minutes of waiting, > the receiver trying to grab the item before someone else does (but the search doesn't always work, so it's means spamming to try and get the item to show up to even figure out if it's posted).- some parts of the game haven't been implemented yet (see recommendations and discussion).recommendations:- build on the guild experience. add a guild chest, guild house, etc., more content for us to do as a group - add way for us to help out other guild members with gear instead of trying to go to the market place at the same time and one of us trying to scoop up whatever the other just posted for as cheap as they can post it.- accelerate the addition of existing content. we have gear dropping for assassin/mystic, but don't have the classes. also, we have dungeons for the current level cap that don't drop loot. because of this, there's no incentive to do those dungeons. we also have slevel (for unlocking the last 2 skills/traits), content beyond level 45, and other pieces of the game that i would love to experience, but they are still unavailable.discussion:as mentioned in the pros, the pvpve balance is done well. it will only get better as content is added.i am shocked that so much of the community dove into a game that is labelled as early access, bought a founder's pack to get a head start in early access (early access??) and are raging about the imperfections. yes, the game has been released in 3 other regions, it should be at least more well optimized. but that also means we knew what bugs to expect. if they aren't fixed on the other regions, why would they bring us the game all polished and not bring it to the other regions first (where these players have been waiting)? also, regarding the server issues, i personally feel as though they didn't expect some of the larger streamers to bring attention (and more people) to this game, causing queue times and full servers.they are even being very lenient on refunds for people who are absolutely unsatisfiable. that's a great move by them honestly.tl;dr -there are problems, it's early access, it's to be expected. but i like this game a lot so far and can't wait to see how it improves with time.",0

7076,"this is game is absolutely stunning!i've spent hours playing this card game and i can almost ensure that all who play this game will become addicted. many have asked if this is better than hearthstone...based upon personal preference. though, in my opinion this game is a challenge and actually takes skill to be able to win. no more hearthstone rng!-pros-*outstanding ranked system for serious players*well rounded core cards (including how the new dark brotherhood cards were well thought out and don't break the core cards)*having a (pv.ai) solo arena on top of a (pvp) versus arena is a refreshing touch for this genre in a aaa card game*gold core cards and legendary (ungolden & golden) cards are not too flashy while still maintaining their high quality luster*overally mechanics of this game...exceptional! (they are still constantly working to improve every little detail*daily achievments give a good amount of gold.-cons-*not a whole lot of cards just yet, there are only a few styles for each deck type (after another expansion there will be plenty of card variation between decks)*the ai could be a little more challenging*that's all i have for a con's list, enjoy the game!",1

9947,the only thing you need to know is that pvp is a fruitless task to do cause most of the players spam all of the characters and it gets tedious over time so don't do pvp at all...ever -_- other than that have fun playing the other aspects of elsword.,1
9084,"planetside 2 is a very interesting f2p mmofps. if there was a mixed review option, this is where i would use it. but now looking back towards its first year when it launched (which you can find the player counts here[steamcharts.com]) compared to what it is now, i simply can't recommend this game anymore due to not having that much of a stable playerbase anymore. as usual with (somewhat) older games, the more skilled players only tend to play the game now with the acception of newer players trying it out. i've known numerous players who want to get into the game yet struggle when the veteran players seems to dominate in every way possible. take quake live for example, the small community there tends to just be veterans of the game which makes it very hard for people to get into the game.but not everyone is like that, though. i have myself for that example as i started playing ps2 halfway through its lifespan before quitting around br55-65. thus meaning it is very much possible to catch up to higher skilled players. this isn't including how oddly optimized this game is as it seems to bottleneck or straight up lag most of the time unless you have an extremely overkill computer.tl;dr low player base, sluggish optimization, and not a very easy game to get into (for most).",0

14769,"great game! amazing gameplay and custimisation that fits everyone's needs. the one downside. the one thing that really f***ng pisses me off; the difference between forging and recycling. 4x the cost!!! e.g: i have an electroshield g left and i can sell it for 1200 robits. however, i can buy it for fu**ing 4800 robits!!! sure, like 10-20 robits difference would be fine, but nope! you have to change it by 3600 robits to rob us from everything we own. thanks game!i had to thumbs down this game because of this. if this problen had changed, i would definately reccomend this game!must. fix. now.",0

5267,"what i think of this game:the game itself isn't so bad, i like it very much for a ssb inspired game, but let's be a bit more clear.-pros:1: the game is cool, character are cute looking and funny to see.2:there are 2 special weapons for each character, that's kinda cool(in smash you have only 1 special move, shhh)3:(talking abut the beta here) the lag isn't so high even if you play this in europe(i'm italian and i never lagged once)4:hey, it's ssb on pc andd it will be f2p, what you want more? :d-cons:1:the abscence of a voice pack(pls add some cool voice for the chars t_t)2:skins for 2,66 in the market, hey i know it's f2p but please...3:saw there will be even characters to buy with money... ok ssb4 has them too, but come on t_t4:remember the point 2 in the pros? well i put it here too because there isn't much variety... they are pretty much always the same, even if some has different skins depending to the chars(and different moves), that it's actually pretty cool.5:no face changing, hey i know this is a beta, but i hope you'll change the faces of the characters when they get hit hard or lightly... i saw some character with a creepy smile even when hit(maybe they are sado fans, but...)6: the moves are pretty always the same and trying to combo them can be pretty hard...so, yeah, basicly even if there are lots of cons, i'm still talking about a beta game here. as i said already the game is awesome and can be fun, if you are thinking to get the beta key, do it",1

13502,really good game but could use maybe a ranged weapon like a bow or rifle. maybe they could add magic cells like a fire one that would shoot fireballs and to make it you need lave. over all great game 10\10 :d,1
11789,"what is the point of purchasing this game, when player can not play with their friends on the same server and faction(union)? meanwhile that server stays locked for eternity??? completely pointless to buy this game. heard so much about graphics and gaming are exciting...but can not join with friends is utterless useless.",0
15280,this game is fun to play with friends. but it is also gay and highly ing racisist. i swear it favors one person on the board. the random picking is horrible because not once did anyone land on my property the whole game. the world championships thing is ing aids (it needs to be nerfed). all in all this game is 90% luck. u cant be a half darkie and play this game.,0
13101,"pros:- free- silly and funny at times- good customization- lots of weapons, armour, junk and other items to collect- quests, and fun ones at that- relaxing if taken lightly- achievementscons:- can be annoying if unlucky (repetitive deathclaw attacks)- expensive microtransactions- can become repetitivepersonal rating: 4/5",1

21814,"heavy reliance on autoaim and functionality that snaps your crosshair to the target when activating scope/ironsights. aiming by moving, rather than looking. (ie: to aim slightly to the left, take a few steps left.) less trying to line up your crosshair with your target and more predicting where your target **will** be and trying to line up your crosshair with their path of motion and then just firing at the right time.if you get really, really used to this and haven't had much time with a mouse, trying to switch to a mouse feels over sensitive and twitchy. if you try and fall back on your old habit of lining up your shots with movement rather than aiming, the binary input of the keyboard suddenly becomes a limitation vs the analog input of a stick.if we had an ideal method for putting a mouse in our right hand and an analog stick in our left while not losing easy access to the keyboard, we would have the best of both worlds.",1
2992,"the game was great! i've been playing since the early open beta around a year or 2 ago and loved it! i would have given it a 10/10, but now ever since a patch that came out around last december i would give it a 2or3/10. the gameplay is the same and is very fun to play whether alone or with friends but now you have to grind just to get 1 plane. before i could just buy plane after plane in tiers but now i have to grind for research points (which are very hard to earn) to research a plane. plus gajiin went and had to make the game go from free2play (completely) (only buy if you feel like it) to having to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 matches or more. you basically have to buy golden eagles so you can convert them all to research points to speed up the research of a new plane. i would still reccomend this game if you are into fun aviation type games and playing with friends but the free2play aspect is just no longer here.",0
