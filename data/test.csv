2212,"as a diablo series, and generally blizzard funboy, i can tell that these guys did a pretty good job on the game, concidering the game is actually free unlike diablo for exp.as far as i know there isnt anything you can get with real money, so there goes the pay-to-win aspect, a big variety of skills, abilities , and a massive talent tree gives you alot of choises on how to actually play your char.the only thing that could be a little bit confusing to new players would be the way that the minimap is working ( it looks like it is bugged, unless it is actually bugged on me :p ). generally the game is actually fun to play and its worth your time!! /",1

10737,"a very fun ccg with mechanics in line with magic ( colors of mana, mana cards have to be drawn, defender chooses blockers, instant cast spells usable on opponent's turn, etc). the initial intro with the starter decks is a little tedious, but once you get past that the game is shockingly fair for a free to play game.for single player content, you have the gauntlet and the forge. the gauntlet is free and pits your constructed deck against up to ai in a row (one loss and you start over) for progressively better rewards (gold, cards, card packs if you win all ). the forge lets you draft cards to play games against the ai and ends if you lose twice. you keep all the cards you draft and can also win - card packs and a chunk of gold (buy in is . packs worth of gold), making this a great way to build your collection while learning the game.multiplayer currently has ranked and draft, with each ranked win giving gold / cards (sometimes a pack with a lucky roll) and draft is like the forge on steroids, with you drafting (and keeping!) a larger number of cards to create your deck.i've been collecting cards so fast i felt obligated to send some money the dev's way, which is a hell of a contrast from many other games in this genre.",1

12176,"after hours in, heres my review. quick and to the point. wont repeat majority of what others stated.lvls - = same grind you have always done in every game. - end game = buy lvl gear off ah, + some of it, add some spirits. run highest level dungeon in game, bosses have % chance to drop no loot at all. dungeon lockout of twice a day. spend + months farming level gear. to then wait on raid content update. week duplication exploit ruined economy, week chili exploit re-ruined economy. week ? if you did not take advantage during week - have fun grinding money for no real reason.pvp rewards nothing currently, pvp goes from broken, to patched and break something else each week.week mages press for free wins, week if your a paladin you can v people.multiple skills on each class do not work, paladins cleanse literally does nothing, so you are forced to just watchs dots tick on you. multiple mage cc abilities do not actually cc.taming gets extremely grindy and repetitive for little to no satisifaction of rewards. marketplace (ah) is terrible, if you list a super rare item your capped on how much you can sell it for, if you sell a super abundant item, you must sell it for sightly more then the current going price, placing your item behind literal thousands of copies, so it will take days or weeks to sell.in a nutshell game was worth $ for hours. if all japan server content was live in this version i could look past the bugs, annoyances, server lag, etc. etc. etc... but its just not. game has no end game content currently, no road map of when it will come, and not enough activities with rewards to warrent waiting months for new content.",0
11618,"it's a good sport game, interface is quite standard and easy to grasp, has some special movements that will need some training to master them so its not too easy to learn. you need your time to master just position, and a lot more if you plan to master all positions.big downside is game is full of im-too-pro-to-play-with-you, new players are harassed, bullied, and insulted in / of the games (in the rookie channel), / in pro channel (that you will reach after just - weeks of play).you may find this / person that may help you and give hints about how to get better, but its a rare event (i have found like people in month).so if you are a rager and don't mind at all the standard internet game community education level there's some fun here. if you have some minimal education or don't have the patience to deal with raging kids / you may aswell skip the trouble of playing.plus the pw side is strong. don't expect to win any game against a team of full stuffed cash heavy players, unless you are one of them.",0

5436,"this is a fun game. can be a little unbalanced at times, and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team. but it is fast paced, within only a day of game time i've already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank. i think this game has alot of potential.edit: after a few days of grinding i think its only fair to update my review.first off, the teams are rarely useful, tier iv tanks are also rarely useful. i cant tell you how many matches i've played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself, which only dooms your team. and dont even get me started on the huge gap between tier iv and tier v tanks. at leas in tier i - iv you can damage the enemy, i've played the german, japanese, and american skill tree (working on the russians now) and i can tell you tier v's are way too over armored, even using premium ammo i only damage them maybe out of ever shots. and its never enough to actually contribute.grinding in this game to get from tier iv to tier v means you join as many battles as you can and watch your win ration slowly go down. earning a mear to xp per match until you have the staggering k xp it takes to research a tier v... with all that said, tier i - iii is super fun and usually fairly balanced. i still see potential in this game.",1

9564,"a fairly addictive d bullet hell game.be prepared to grind a lot, but the grinding is far from boring. dungeons are randomly generated, and can also have treasure rooms to multiply your loot gain.by far my favorite part of the game is the loot system. the more damage you do to the boss, the more loot you get. it inscentivises and rewards actively tackling the boss instead of leeching, though some more difficult bosses drop treasure chests that contain the loot.the game currently still has a lot of problems, left by the old developers.kabam's logic instead of fixing duping, let's just make a lot of the rarest items in the game untradable.we'll ban some people for hacking if they're reported, but not have moderators to actively survey the situation.let's make some of the best items in the game available for purchase in the starting area for ten dollars so that new players can see how great we areall in all, / praise deca",1
1813,"joining dota is like moving to america from another country. as a new immigrant, you will be yelled at, spit upon, called racial slurs that are incorrect to your nationality, and screamed at for being stupid and ignorant. you will be a drain on every match causing the economy of your team to drop with your silly actions. those who are long-time natives will support your with their skilled labor. you will be given gold to buy things that you don't deserve. after several hundred hours of work, for which you see little to no compensation, you will finally do something right. people will look at you in shock. how did this second rate citizen do so well? was it blind luck? a miracle? the immigrants who have no desire to assimilate will continue to laugh at you (jajajajajaja) and shame you, yelling at you in spanish and portuguese. but if you keep at it, if you do nothing but play, you will have more of these moments where the real citizens start to treat you as one of their own. even complimenting, nay, commending you from time to time. on that long road to being a citizen of this new capitalist jungle if you succeed, you will be praised and glorified. you will given wealth and fame. people will watch your every move and pay you money to learn to be you. if you already live in america, and don't want to learn what it feels like to be an immigrant, then you could continue to sit on your entitled whiteand play heroes of the storm.if you like this review, check out some of my other reviews: wunweg's reviewsor check out my blog: zeemodernnerdblog[zeemodernnerdblog.wordpress.com]",1

9060,"i just reinstalled and retried planetside for the first time since it came out, and i can say with unwavering certainty that its one of the very worst new player experiences ive ever had with a game. it was mesmerizingly terrible at giving a positive first impression.- despite having just installed what one should reasonably assume was the latest version via steam, the game still required a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup, as well as a third party registration, without the ability to sync with my steam account.- the tutorial is stretched over a needlessly expansive area, and the narrators lines frequently bleed into and play over one another if one moves along ahead of the plodding pace it wants one to. needless to say, this renders any help such lines could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless, leaving one to flail about and learn through trial and error, rather than instruction, instead.- the very first thing i experienced upon connecting to an instant action is getting spawn killed with an airstrike not one second after setting foot on the ground. fan-ing-tastic.- the ui is one of the very worst ive ever encountered in terms of giving mechanical information to new players. i know it shows information on controlled areas, flashpoints, how many friendlies and hostiles are detected in an area, etc, and thats all nice; however, there are some much more practical questions it seems intent on not answering. where can i spawn? how can i change respawn locations? why, when i attempt to decipher the help menu tooltips for the map, and find that i must use warp facilities to change spawn regions, am i greeted with an insta-death restricted area message upon attempting to reach one of those facilities? who knows! im just constantly told to click the instant action tab, and let the game carry me off to wherever it thinks im needed, regardless of whether i want that region or not. - when i attempted to ask other players in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill, i was greeted with the following automated message: the dead cant speak. i actually uttered an are you ing kidding me? aloud in my office at this point.i know planetside is a well-respected game, and im sure, once one is familiar with it, that theres some reason for that. this isnt about that. this isnt a comprehensive review, nor is it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game. this is simply a commentary regarding the initial impression its current version gives to new, uninitiated players. the short version is this: i felt unwelcome, not by the players, not by my squad, not by my faction, but by the game itself, as a newcomer to planetside . at every turn, it seemed as though i was getting punished for not knowing things that a proper tutorial should have taught me, for not realizing the answers to questions i didnt realize i even needed to ask. it felt as if it were deliberately obfuscating critical information that it just expected me to know without proper instruction. ill make this as clear as i can: my initial impressions of planetside were so negative that ive no desire to learn the lessons necessary to further understand the game. im sure the answers are there. im just left with such a poor impression of my experience that ive no inclination to pursue them. im leaving the game - again - and this time, im not returning.",0

10126,"i am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.*** gameplayi tried this game and liked it so much that i purchased a one-year membership after a few days. the relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. you basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. there are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. you will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. tracking gets easier the more you play. with the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. it also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. this game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time. *** membershipsall players start as guest and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. a membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. a permanent license is not available.*** hunting groundsthe reserves in the western part of this world resemble of american continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in europe. currently seven reserves are available. each has its own charm and of course its animal species. at the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. you can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. the maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.*** animalsat this point the game features species. some of them can attack the player. many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. for many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. shooting animals in thehunter quite demanding. the animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.*** weaponsa host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. using the open sights can be just as much fun though. depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. there is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals. shooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.*** equipmentthere is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. there are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting. *** in-game moneyall game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. it can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires. *** missionscurrently there are a total of missions available. most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. you will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.*** competitions & leaderboardscompetitions are run around the clock for all animals. players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. the top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. in addition em$ can be earned. all animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. the best players will make their way into the hall of fame. *** multiplayermultiplayer parties are client-based, there are no mp servers. in the game it is possible to chat with others. players can hunt as team or on their own. it is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.*** things i don't like- the website's style is not outdoor-like. also the font size and the line spacing are too large. there is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store.- the large antlers of the red deer are completely unrealistic. the red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being european.- some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. the most obvious ones are the brown bear and the roe deer.- it is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them. sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.*** conclusionthe game is constantly being enhanced with new content. it remains one of the best games i have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. it is unique with its lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. there is a great random factor and unpredictability, which i think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. i keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old.",1

177,"after seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,i wanted to make a review talking about what a great horror game this is.first of all,it's free.i really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.karamari hospital (the dlc) costs just under $,but if you enjoyed the game i would recommend the dlc.now,i'm gonna get into the main review.the game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.the game doesn't feel like it stole these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references..if you find jump scares scary.get this game..if you are unsure,try watching markiplier or someone play it,that's how i found out about it.just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises..i found i rarely died from enemies,but that was because i was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.time to talk about the enemies!!(i won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(possible spoilers)specimen .the main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,i began to fear them more then the actual enemies.they jump scare you,but the do it all the time,and it's terrifying.specimen and chase you around,they aren't the scariest.i skipped a bit of the game,(i'm gonna replay it all soon),so i missed the specimen and parts.they still look spooky though.specimen is well...the bane of my existence.specimen is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.his death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of zelda references,which i quite enjoyed.just,when you play the game,be ready for specimen .specimen isn't really scary.but it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters much harder.specimen is the deer god.things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then shows up,and the terror begins.although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.specimen randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.i have never encountered him before,[spoileri] he re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.it is fun,and similar to the ganon battle from loz:ooc.[/spoileri] specimen is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.i don't entirely remember him,but i remember he is very hard to run away from.specimen ,who i refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.i remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe i was just nervous when i entered his area.the area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.there is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.specimen the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.it takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.it was very fun,and scary.specimen who i call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to kaernk from 'amnesia:the dark descent'.you must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.it was really fun,and the area before was very scary.that raps up the review of the monsters,but i have a few more things to say..the game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror..the game has a lot of references,which is one of the best parts of the game..this game is terrifying.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :)i would definitely recommend this game./",1
15343,"business tour is a monopoly variant. the game plays the exact same way with some additional changes like festivals, air ports and world tours. instead of just making your opponents go bankrupt, there are additional objectives. own all the property on one side of the board, own land of each colour or have the most value at the end of the game. the game will default end in minutes.gameplay-wise, you still roll the classic pair of dice for a roll and move mechanic. however, there is paid cheating here. for coins, you can get to reroll your dice results. for coins, you can choose to ensure both your dice are the same number. these coins can be paid for in cash. whenever you land on a location, you can either buy the land and build houses on it or pay the rent and repurchase it from the current owner.conclusion, skip this game. it's a pay to win clone of monopoly. there is nothing new and the ability to use spend cash to buy coins to gain in-game advantages is just disgusting. if you play the tutorial, you know that the results can be rigged to show numbers even before they rolled. also, you need chips to bet with to play the game.note : business tour is done by floor games and gaf media.pros. it's free if you love bots, you can play it solo all the time.cons. pay to winjust pay cash to optimize your dice moves. gold for $.. for ,, chips. clone of monopolywhere's the originality?",0

(cough)of course, it is not a perfect masterpiece when it comes to pvp and inventory management, but come on, it's a free game that you'd probably still pay a considerable amount of money if it were priced.everything in the game is obtainable by farming and spending time, there is no - pay win - associated with this game. of course, there is - pay advance faster -, but it's totally up to you if you like the game, therefore you decide if you'd like to support the developers or not, with a little buck.i rate this game /, because it could have been better. though, i believe that it's engine doesn't allow it... and it's a little repetitive once you've got the basis of it.do not hesitate on playing this game! it is definitely worth a try. but, hear from me, it could bring addiction. play safe.",1

14129,"infestation | the newzbefore you read, i would like to say that i have over hours on this game before steam release.infestation | the newz, is an official rework of the original (and bad) title infestation | survivor stores, formerly known as the warz, the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called fredaikis ab, there is not a single dev from the original iss on this development team.everyone knows the warz and how bad the game was. it was riddled with hackers, it was seriously pay to win, loot was rare, so it made hackers even more populated, it was full of bugs that devs did not patch, and lets be honest... there was no content. all there was to do is pvp.now... on the other hand, fredaikis ab, the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did, they are listening to the community, and trying their best to make a game that you guys want. they have released an anticheat called mlg anticheat, this anticheat was designed just for this game, i have over hours before steam and i have only got cheated once. i repeat once.due to the lack of content the previous game had, they made about different pvp server maps, so you can hop into it and pvp right away, they made a custom br, they added airdrops, (these drop about every hour) on official servers, they have revamped the ui, they have added alot of guns that the original iss did not have. and armor,helmets etc. and they added skins < traders dream! they have completely removed the pay win aspect of the game, now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market. they have not removed (gc) gold credits, you can use this to purchase a private server to loot, or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place. this is just to support this game and keep it alive.some of you guys need to understand, they need to have a few things they can make money off of. a game is not free, they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that , people are playing on.",1

(hopefully soon)as far as the combat, the combat system is fairly week for the moment, being limited to only / buttons.the graphics are to be expected when playing any ae game. monsters are pretty badass.crafting system is iffy, taking awhile on some things to craft a piece of armour that you need, sometimes being days long. leveling also takes a while to level up, but for me thats no problem as i enjoy the challenge of leveling. but you should know this if you're a fan of battleon.overall i think the game is good right now especially for a beta. will only get better in time, i hope. but for now if i hate to rate it, definately /.

3054,"product received for freeedit, nov : wow. just... wow. if you're here for ship-to-ship combat, i gotta say that wows does it better. sorry, but it's true.edit, may : i have almost hours in-game?! why do i keep doing this to myselfedit: with about hours played at the time of this edit, clearly i am not paying attention to my own negative recommendation. i do enjoy the game, and recommend it to anyone playing wot as the next step in tank combat games. wot feels pre-pubescent in comparison. if you want air combat or to blast people with tanks, or both, try this out. many things have changed in war thunder since i began, good and bad, but i keep coming back. the gui is still garbage, but i know how it works now. i'm going to keep my recommendation negative, because wt is very hard for new players to get into.::: what follows was my first impression after about hours of play ::: yay, planes. yay, tanks.boo, matchmaking balance. boo, one of the most unintuitive gui's i've ever seen.it's fun the first few matches. the matchmaking system is merciful, and takes pity on the noobs. suddenly, once you get a plane that happens to not be a biplane, regardless of whether you select a biplane to begin with, matchmaker decides that you are an elite ace pilot, and makes sure to never disappoint you by giving you any match that's too easy. or fair.i can't for the life of me figure out this interface, either. if i want to do something like change a crew from plane to plane , i apparently need to go buy some sort of manual for the game. coming from certain other free games of this variety, i just cannot tell what they were thinking when they designed this thing.if i want to play in a match full of biplanes it seems i must send any higher tier planes on holiday and then go into the match so i don't get placed in a game with jet fighters by accident. problem? if i mysteriously decide i'd like to fly a higher tier plane i've sent on holiday, i must do some sort of 're-purchase' of the crew, as if they'd all died in a barracks fire or perhaps choked to death on their bloody tea and crumpets while i was out. can i decide which crew goes to which plane? seems not.i like the gameplay. i absolutely abhor the gui. matchmaking needs help.enter at your own risk. godspeed.edit: after over hours, i'm still learning new things about this gui. stockholm syndrome has set in. i see the reasons they've done things in particular ways, but there's still a ton of room for improvement.i still can't really recommend the game unless you're at least mildly masochistic. come, join me in the darkness, but don't say i didn't warn you.",0

3047,"the greed of these devs has always been impressive. they do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. at tier and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.and worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. so once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.with ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.but of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.coming back to the game, i wanted to try out this new pve tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. the problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. and to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.on top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total a . rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. in air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have - times the weaponry. in ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. in naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0

2289,path of exile has to be one of my favorite games of all time. i've put a decent amount of time into the game and i've still got alot of things to learn. i'm a huge fan of hardcore and i think it really adds to the game. when you first get into the game it feels slow and you have a lot to learn. if you take the time to get past that hump and stick with the game i'm sure you'll learn just how good of a game it is.,1

16025,"ive been playing artix entertainment games since and ive grown up with the company.ive played every single one of their games to some extent yes even pony vs pony. now fast forward years and their first d game is in open beta. now aqd is a fantastic mobile game it has allot of things other mobile games fail to offer or can only offer so much of. as for pc game its kinda meh i guess you could say. it does lack allot of what other games have to offer and i do think/hope itll be better in the future. now dont get me wrong ive put allot of time into the game on the pc version, roughly hours now. considering how small the aqd team is you have to give them props the games been being developed by less then people and its incredible how far theyve come in terms of a game so you cant really critisize the team/game too much and considering its only been in development for not even years its incredible on what theyve accompleshed , however i do wish they would grab the staff from all of their other games and have them work on aqdand that could cause th game to be updated and have twice as much content at a faster rate. now i wont list the pros and the cons because what ill say is essentially copy and paste of everyone elses reviews.just know they are listening and theyve made a ton of changes based on player feedback in the past and will in the future.i do reccomend you support them to help the game reach its full potential",1

15582,"(from pc and android)so ive expected this game since it was announced.can i recommend this game ? yes and no...ive played adventure time, dragon fable and adventure time world. all of em are awesome games and its nice to see everything d coming to life in d.but and its a big but. the game isnt finished i cant really say its even in open beta... too few locations only starting classes excluding the guardian which is premium class. unneccesery crafting system that takes real time...aqw had crafting and it was fine and it didnt require waiting... the wait time is probably just to extend the game as much as possible at this stage. im kinda use to the game being unfinished cause i played in the unfinished (beta) version of aqw. still worlds had way more classes available at the beta phase more locations more quests everything more. for the time this game has been in development i expected a little more.this game is a good time waster tho, there isnt much you can do in the game at the moment but i expect a lot more content in the future. i expect this game to have the same amount of content as aqw cause that game is absolutly briliant. aqd only has the name the feel the humor and its a true cross platform ( i play it on my phone ) a potato can run this game but thats all about it for it.it has stupid unneccesery crafting wait time and gear is focused more on grinding materials now (which isnt that bad)it has too few locations and key locations dont exist the town isnt even finished half of the buildings are still coming soon.back to my question do i reccoment it ? yes if you love adventure time and you are willing to waitno for the new players to aq games cause this is bare bones game with very little content at the moment ( just wait )go play aqw till this is finished.overall for this review ill say no.//.",0

16363,the idear is good but sadly it doesnt realy execute the term unlockin the dlc means you can work out the skill tree but not that you alrady can work with them also keep in mind for the steam version you need internet conection if i knew this i didnt even buy the starter kit and read a book or the concept works but that is sayed with it if they improve this its a good game (simulator?),0

14197,"i would't recommend this game just yet!it's really hard to connect to any server (+ tries) and the servers spew you out quite often. can't remember last time i had more than mins of uninterrupted gameplay, and then you go all over to the connecting part.as for gameplay part ... players shoot on sight regardles if u have a weapon or not. it's pvpve in a nutshell",0
4648,"does smite need any more word-of-mouth than it already has? probably not. but i'll throw in my two cents into the well anyway.before i even mention anything about the game itself i want to talk about the community that plays this game... word here is toxic. absolutely vitriol and toxic. so much anger and hatred is oozing from the vast majority of the player base polluting what could be an otherwise enjoyable experience. out of matches will devolve into a shouting match like the screenshot above. and this isn't even a smite problem to be honest, it's mainly a moba problem and the type of games that just attract this sort of crowd. be prepared to be yelled at, a lot. oh and yelling isn't even the worst of it. also be prepared to get reported. there's nothing more sore losers love than to press that report player button after almost every match. this game is not friendly to newcomers.with that out of the way i guess i should touch up on the game itself. it plays like any other moba out there; there's towers, minions, jungles, and an hq. but what makes smite stand apart from the crowd is it's unique perspective. instead of a typical top-down moba view smite will have you play via third person. so instead of having your camera roaming all over the place at all times you're invested in your character at all times. it's a nice breath of fresh air from the typical formula.now there is one final thing i wish to address before i call it a wrap here: loot crates. that god awful scourge that's rotting the gaming industry down to it's core. smite is waist deep in loot crates. granted it's not pay--win because everything is purely cosmetic. but with that said the prices are outrageous. the chests cost gems or $. and usually have total possible items in it. the catch? only to items in said chest are skins (that you probably actually want) the other + items are generally stupid emotes or other worthless trash you don't care for. so think about that for a moment, $ emotes, how do you feel about paying $ for an emote? someone who spent nearly or over $ on these damned treasure chests i regret every moment of it and wish i could take it all back. sure i got some of the skins i wanted but more often than not it was some lame avatar or emote i could care less about. and so i had to buy another loot crate until i got a slightly more favorable outcome. it's gambling, it's gambling at it's worst. and they make this problem a whole lot worse with exclusive and limited content. it's all about that buy mentality and falling for the hype and the marketing.if you're sitting here and debating if you should give smite a try i'll save you the trouble and suggest you look elsewhere to spend your time and money. but if you absolutely have to play this game be prepared for the toxic players and the irresistible allure of loot crates.",0
9905,"this game is extremely fun when you play with friends or a guild. however most people quit right away for specific reasons. one of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. in order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. then decide if you want to pvp or pve or both. at the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. as far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money.there's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. you have to buy a b slot so you can use your other skills. elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.negatives are:-half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids.-costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though.-grindier at the higher levels-not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. guides are nice but everyone has a preference.-events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.positives are:-fast paced side scrolling action. it's not a point-and-click game. it's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based.-every boss is different and unique.-new content continously-when you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts!-getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. el shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ed from dungeon runs.-pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so i would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot.-my favorite reason for playing elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!as for typical ratings here they are!/ for gameplay/ for content [we usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on na server]/ for community [good friends are a jewel and people always come and go]/ for affordability [cash shop super over priced]/ for customization [tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes! mounts were recently released so there aren't many yet!]/ for customer support/ for gamepad support [better off using custom keys on gamepad]",1

24770,"another problem, and this is going to sound like victim-blaming but i dont care, is that a *tiny minority* of women respond positively to these sorts of interactions, whether they like the attention, are trolling, or just being nice, which sort of opens the floodgates so to speak...some men are willing to wade through/piss off % of decent people who just want to play the game to find that one girl who will send them a picture of someone else's boobs and claim they're hers.again, i want to make it clear this is a very small minority and most of the onus for this problem is on the people being abusive, but if saying nothing is being complicit, so is playing along. that tiny fraction of hope is what keeps this behavior going",1

17373,"product received for freei think we can all agree that school of dragons is nothing more but a scam of a kids game. and it's all because of gems. gems everywhere. you need gems to get dragons, you need gems to open rare chests, you need gems to buy more stables, and you need more gems to buy coins if you don't wanna do quests, and on, and on, and on! this game is demanding for you to spend all of the money that you have in your wallet so that you can enjoy the game. sure, there are ways you can obtain gems, be it invitations, watching videos, stuff like that, but this is just nuts. that's why we've got hackers all over school of dragons. because gems are very costly. you want the max load of gems? you gotta pay $ dollars. you want membership for a whole year? pay $ and you'll get your wish! even psn isn't this bad, with only $ for a whole year. sure it's still expensive, but that's to be expected from sony, not a company that made those little pc games for little kids. bugs, glitches, hackers, the works. it's all because jumpstart is nothing but money grabbing monster, robbing both you or your money and of your sanity with all its flaws.. don't let your kids spend all of your money onto this game, else you're gonna try calling them, and they won't even respond to your call, or just say something completely different, ignoring your problem.. which, i'm pretty sure they don't. i pray that after the release of how to train your dragon , can we get a game like this, but less tedious, more visually appealing, more freedom, and most importantly of all, not being a pay to win game.but knowing how movie based console games usually are, i don't think we can ever get a game like that,burn in hell, jumpstart.",0

11824,"rarely write reviews but this time i really felt compelled to do so, therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably boring.short story: you should really give this game a true chance, without the pregiudice of any review (good or bad).i am so disappointed to see so many bad reviews from people that have played this game hours at max, and from people that still need to get to finish the story (and/or get a decent gear).this game has potential, it is not like every other game out there, it gives you a true free-to-play option; the in-game shop is just cosmetics and you can get the in-game shop currency just by playing the game! (dungeon grinds and conversion of points in currency.)there is an anti-cheat now that has killed all the cheaters (the ones that are leaving bad reviews i can bet on it).you'll have open pvp everywhere in contested areas of the huge map. there is a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rushing end game and complain that there is no content!pvp and pve is balanced and, the pvp is truly that as most games have arena duels and matchaking bs.this game has a lot of very well done content but, as every game, has things that need to be improved.it is your choice, you can see only the bad things or you can see the good ones too, and acknowledge that nothing is as you'd wish it to be %.the game has performance issues as every mmo game out there; the graphics are in range with every other mmo as well.now you'll need to tweak your own .ini file to get the best out of the game graphics (it can be annoying, i understand that, but, there are hunderds of guides out there that can help you do it in min) and you'll need to go into your nvidia control panel and switch the game's vram from integrated to dedicated.this game messed up badly at launch, this is very true, but at the same time, the dev team behind this game, is not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about. the dev team listens to the community and strives to improve this game every day.keep in mind that the people playing the game make the community, if the cheaters that bought this game want to leave a bad review out of spite, i cannot say anything more than to stop reading at the reviews and give this game a true chance. it is free now.nevertheless i'll keep buying my premium membership (which doesn't give any pw advantage) to support the devs, because this game deserves to be succesful more than bdo (owned), tes:o (owned) and whatever mmorpg you can think about (i have played them all).p.s. even though most people got refunded the purchase of the game, they still complain. you'll have to decide for yourselves who's in bad faith, but for as far as i can tell it is not the dev team. i am just tired of people donwvoting games that deserve tho shine while upvoting trash games.",1

(.)this game is great for those who like adventuring games and for those who like competition games. there are in-game modes, such as pvp or shadow towers. (.) explore new worlds taking on new dungeons and as you level up your character level and gear you can go to higher and tougher difficulty worlds getting access to worlds with gems (to further upgrade your character's stats) and new items. (.) daily challenges to earn rewards and do dungeons to earn rewards and loot. (.) make your own club or join other in-game clubs, start gathering materials to make your own legendary dragon mount, or take on shadow towers to get lots of loot. (.) the trove devs have life streams on twitch, if you have time watch them to gain knowledge on upcoming updates or changes to the game and if your lucky enough you may win really rare in-game items or mounts, such as the rare legendary bird ganda. (.) team up with others to make your game easier. only downside is how the devs keep changing the game mechanics, this would become a great game if they minimized making frequent changes (most of the changes in-game become beneficial to you) cons:(.) many people who have played this game may agree that they have experienced this while playing this game. which is known as lag. this has been a problem for awhile in trove. even after some patches and fixes some people still continue to experience lag. if you do not like lag this may not be the game for you.(.) there are some toxic people in this game who may target you for being a person that has just started the game. expect some people to say insults to put you down.(.) there are also scammers and spammers in this game. they seem to offer you a good deal but once you hand over what they want, they will either not give you anything back or give you something you did not want.(.) the game does have major updates once in a while and can impact your gameplay. some people dislike this.(.) the game over time has become more of a pay to win game. this had a negative influence and is drawing some people away from playing the game. (ahh did you miss the free items we gave back awhile go? guess what you can still get it by paying real money for it!) (oh do you like this? well you are going to need money for it). for example, characters previously were able to be bought with in game materials (it was very easy to get more characters), but now you have to pay real money to obtain classes you don't already have or you can make the classes but that requires many materials and that brings up the next con.(.) grinding/farming. this has become a foundation for this game. this annoys many people and may be the reason why the person does not play this game. if you want to become at the top of the game you are going to have to go through this. want to reach the max level? guess what you are going to fight enemies for a few hours just to level up once. want a mount that you like? you are going to have to spend some time getting the materials you need to get it.information:(.) trove does not offer refunds for things bought with real money in game. you could possibly get in contact with them.overall still a fun game to play despite the cons.",1

13683,"this game is highly addictive if you play it right! and what i mean by play it right is to actually be creative and build things, alongside discovering recipes, exploring, acquiring materials for your builds, creating gear to aid you in your quests, and above all... doing all of these things with your friends. i've gotten many of my friends to give this game a shot, but very few of them actually get the idea of what to really do. instead of being creative and building awesome structures, exploring, delving through caves and the things i love to do, they just get the best gear in the game and say i'm bored now... can i go play something else?. that, in my eyes, is not how creativerse is meant to be played. despite being in early access, creativerse is now one of my all-time favorite games. there is so much to do if you think real hard about it and set good goals for yourself, and once you do that, it gets really fun and you get hooked. just like i did. even though creativerse looks so much like minecraft, i think that if you compare both base games (and what i mean by base games are games that have no mods installed, they are completely vanilla, etc...), you would see that creativerse has far more potential than vanilla minecraft. i bet it will be even better if modding support comes out too. i highly recommend this game to those who need a break from minecraft, terraria and all those highly popular sandbox games. creativerse is an excellent game with excellent features. if you're the exploring / building type like me, there are a wide variety of neat land features and a bunch of awesome biomes, with their own creatures with each biome that are themed for the said biome. then there are the huge amount of blocks, furniture, bombs (i love the bombs, lol.), devices, crafting stations, weapons and tools, and so much more. if those who read this review consider getting the game after reading, just get it. it's boring if you don't set the right goals for yourself. take my word on all of this. just get the game.",1

14851,"my how far this game has fallen.i've been into this game since pretty damn near the beginning. back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. that sense of yeah, i built that when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.those days are long since past.the tiering system is gone entirely, and it is so easy to level up, that when i started the game after it was first changed. i jumped from to instantly, and i heard you could jump from even further back than that. the game's menus are so clunky now and they're hard to navigate... i still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. the colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. oh, no more tech points? there goes the fun in unlocking things too.the community robot factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. also, how much are these weapons?! ten million rp for a single top-power weapon? get stuffed i ain't payin' that i only get like -k per battle!!!medic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. if you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. what a load of and the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.i really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. that was actually really fun and it was balanced too. guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.worst of all, the game crashes a lot more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, see ya no reward for you we just wanna waste your time bye! i swear the amount of times i heard a player has disconnected in one match was frightening, just before i crashed myself.i remember the days when i used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. complex, in the sense that all those cube variations; inner slope, edge slope, what? what are these for?at least they refunded all those new garage payments i made so now i have thousands upon thousands of free gc. so there's that at least.update time:so, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. fine, that's alright, it's a good start. what isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of rp whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. to quote, our intent was to help boost the rp income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable.so now what? now there is zero incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of rp just for participation. this just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game... if you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. if you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will earn that reward. but no, everyone gets similar amounts now. it's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day robin hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical wage-gap that no-one can prove exists. there's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so goddamn expensive. even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?well, at least they tried. they killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. i know some of you will call this nitpicking but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...update again:ok. they reverted the reward changes. i take back all that i said before. good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. let's see where the future takes the game now. they still have a bit to fix.",0
727,"warmodethis is a quiet good first game from warteam. this game has its ups and downs, but in this review, i would not judge this game too harshly. this is an online fps game. a great range/variety of weapons to buy to use against the dangerous enemies. what i find is that the damage the weapons do is not that much, unless you get headshots. but like i said this is warteam's first game and they should keep on trying. speaking of the developers, they should really keep an eye on this game and do updates/patches.there are a couple of good maps. but the map that really catches my eye, is the one that they ripped off of counter-strike. developers, if you are reading this, i wouldnt recommend to rip off maps from other games because you may get copyright strikes and negetive reviews because you ripped the map off. but i see that you made a couple mps of your own and i quiet like them.the last time i got onto this game, the multiplayer was dead. in patches/updates try putting something into the game that make the game even more entertaining, like more game modes, for example.overall, i think these developers should keep on trying to update/create games, keep up the good work!./",1

9027,"construction is stupid, new weapons are broken, implants are broken, new server was handled poorly. older development team was better. bring back lord higbylet's get one thing very clear first and for most, jumping into this once excellent game, it's gonna be filled with fully decked out veterans on every front. so expect to die a lot within the first few hours of playing this game, no matter where you go. however, it still fails to quell the satisfaction of saying s of players a side trying to duke it out over a single capture point for the deciding base in an alert, which could turn the odds of winning in exponentially in your favour.however, this game is far from its glory days of the past, where i feel that questionable design decisions have been made in order to improve this game. i've been playing this game ever since its launch and i have seen how this game has grown under both in population and in standard under its previous developer soe. during this period, it truly felt like this game could be something unique. the ambitions of the old development team were high as they pushed out new weapons and a new continent as well as the user cosmetic system. i have seen my old server, briggs, grow from just a few hundred players a night, to well over a few thousand, all occasionally clashing in on one base simultaneously. it was during this period, where for me, even dying a hundred times over made the game experience a lot more endearing.once the new team, daybreak, took over however, the game was quite literally flipped on its head. with the old team, you could feel that they were trying to make a good game, but the new team just feels like they are trying to make a quick buck. first off, with the current construction system, it feels a lot like just filler content for the rich and real-money spenders to get a couple of kills with a nuke, compared to when it was used as tactical objectives. the nuke never really contributes anything tactically towards turning a battle in your favor, other than holding the enemy back for a brief period. next, with the introduction of the newer ns weapons, which are more powerful than faction specific weapons, its giving people more incentive to not use their faction specific weapons and playstyles anymore, as anyone who does is basicallyon by an ns weapon. third, the current state of the implant system is basically broken right now, as there are only real implants that are actually useful in the current meta. if you don't have either of those or you aren't a heavy, you're basically out of luck in almost every one on one. the worst part is that you can buy implants with real world money, which gives year old rich cry babies the ability to go on killing sprees without having to do much prior work!!!the one thing i can commend the new developers for is the introduction of the newer server for the asian region, allowing a large proportion of their players an opportunity to play at a lower latency. with the introduction of this server, they gave veterans the opportunity to transfer their characters to soltech, all except briggs. so, those of us who have dedicated thousands of hours on briggs, had to basically kiss our progress goodbye!!!the culmination of all these design decisions on behalf of daybreak, have driven quite a few of its veterans away, almost ths of a server population in some cases. plus, it fails to give newer players an incentive to keep playing this game. add that to an outdated, soon to be updated (hopefully), graphics engine, i could potentially see this game, which still has so much potential, eventually dying out before it has a chance to fluorish.",0
6929,"lets be clear, the full game costs $+ and this number will climb rapidly over time. do not buy in or you will just continue to encourage the pay to buy cards buisness model that compromises balance and player enjoyment to squeeze as much cash from players as they can tolerate.believe it or not, it would be possible to make a strategic card game that respects the player and prioritizes game balance and player enjoyment. too bad it will never happen because players keep giving in and funding this abusive buisness model.the usual trickle of daily quests disrespects the player by urging them to form a habit of logging in to get a pittance of gold. balance isn't as bad as some other card games, but it won't be long before you'll get hopelessly stomped by players using decks you could never make without dropping a significant chunk of cash.",0

4267,"in short: pay to win game. (pay to get much better cards that can flat you out like truck hitting a bug)it's fun and gameplay really based on your own style. however, in order to win, you need to have the best cards, at least much better than your opponent. so basically to obtain these cards manually is to use your own money or obtainable hardly thru in-game diamond currency (obtainable). it seems very unfair when someone has or better card than you, easily destroys well planned strategy just because they have that one card no one has obtained. point is you need very good card in order to win another player. your basic or normal cards wont do. but the thing is you can get those cards by pouring as much money as you want to obtain fast and easy cards, then you can win against other players who have less good cards than yours.in a word: its a bit pay to win if you play for competitive mode (against real players) but if you play casually, for fun or nostalgic visits, this game might be good. warning : there's a difference when fighting versus npc and player. there will be a huge gap. fighing npc is like fighting a toddler who knows nothing and very straightforward. whereas fighting real player is like you fighting a world championship ufc fighter where they use combos to beat you down and you cant doabout it, and because your gloves are made of cotton and his are made of spiky steel and will beat you down and you will be stunned all the way.",0

15184,"product received for freeearly access reviewrecommendation: not recommended.. hrs on recordearly access reviewso i will begin with the description of the game robocraft, it's purpose and what you do in it. brief description so... robocraft is a multiplayer game in which teams must battle it out until the final survivor from team. what makes this game unique? well you don't battle with cars or any other things, instead you battle with your personal created robot. this robot you create will matter highly how you create it if you want to survive long in the battlefield. how it works: you start off with a few tier blocks as you do in the game, you build your basic first time robot and go into battle in order to get some credits. after a bit of grinding you have enough money to buy more things to add onto your robot like guns, wheels, rocket boosters, more blocks (blocks are classed as armor so the more and better you setup your robot the more hits it can take) and so as you keep adding things to your robot, you reach a robot reputation level if i remember correctly and once you pass a required robot reputation you tier up and unlock higher tier guns, blocks, wheels, boosters and at later game, wings, shields, propellers, helium tanks etc..so doesn't sound too bad right now does it? multiplayer game with custom created robots which can fly, hover or drive whilst fighting with guns, destroying other robots. but... at the beginning you couldn't notice a lot of pw factors fbut there were some minor ones which didn't make a lot of difference, the one feature which many people would pay for are, custom created robots created by the developing team for different tiers. however after a few months things have started going slightly uphill with the amount of pw things being released. so much that you can tell that the developers must be in a struggle. here's where they went really wrong. what they did wrong this is an honest review, and i honestly will tell you to stay away from this garbage. don't get me wrong, the game used to be good, it used too. now it's a terrible game and that's as kindly as i will go. what's wrong with it you ask? well they started bringing out absolute terrible and useless updates, i never saw worse updates for a game than that. it first started with an all of a sudden level boost for every single player for no reason which meant that all those players that spent a lot of time trying to reach the max level () wasted their time when they could have reached lvl and have their level boosted till like lvl . then they brought out a new game mode, that game mode was so stupid that if you was not level + you was wasting your time playing, this is because you was playing against over tiered enemies whilst you could be a hugely lower level. another thing, they made it so that you pay to win different colored blocks for your robot.. yes, blocks that have a different color. you have to pay real money for that now... oh and i just found out that they added a way for you to open crates to get super cool legendary weapons for no reason. yeah, this game was good it had good level progression, fair match making due to different tiered robots get tiered with similar tiers making it a fair match. now that doesn't exist and it all depends on how much money you got in your bank accouunt.i recommend you stay away from this game, it's annoying to say this because i would have kept playing this game if not for these updates. but hey, the game is free so if you're not conviced by this review, you can see it for yourself as the game is free. overall ratings uniqueness: ./entertainement: ./graphics: /difficulty: variedenjoyable: mehpay to win level: / personal recommendation . must get. . recommended purchase. . recommended purchase during sale. . not recommended unless heavily discounted. . not recommended.",0

1011,"product received for freeearly access reviewfor those who want to know a little more before getting this game, here is a basic overview of what is going on:-the game is a v conquest style, the objective is to control key strategic areas in order to gain access to the enemys base and ultimatly capture it-strategys are very important, there are two left and right side wings where you must work up to the enemy side in order to capture a key jump base to get to the enemy base, this plays very well as they are effictevly two seperate maps.-in order to get between the maps you must jump to them, it takes one jump to return to base and two to cross to the other side (ignoring the middle gamma for now), this is very similar to games such as league, where there is effictevly a time gap one can use to make pushes but also allows quick defense, depending on what the other team is doing.-on each side of these two wings are resources you can capture to help buff your team (like a leveling system) - hence control on these is also important-behind these two wings are the bases on each side, which also act as basically seperate maps-finally there is a middle map, that every few minutes will open up. capturing this gives your team a strong buff. battles for these are often heated and are a great way of turning a losing fight around or making the final strike to win a battle. if your team controls one of the enemy's base jump points you can also jump directly to the enemy base.the ships-you play with massive space ships (this is simply the coolest thing ever)-there are three manufactures, each with thier own designs letting you pick/choose your prefered ships-each ship has a role, the basic three being defense, support and attack (with many permutations, but for simplisity these are the main three)-at the begining of a match you can choose your ship and as well talk with your team on your prefered ship and find a suitable team composition-the ships play very well, i find many enjoyable and balancedoverall i am very impressed with what the devs have put together. i personally enjoy balanced competitive games where there is little luck or dice rolling involved and that victory is because you have played better than the other team. so far the community has been great as well, which is fantastic.final comments, the game is free and probably the best space game i have played in a while. just awesome.",1
10618,"even aside from the fact that this game is legitimitely free-to-play (and very generous), this is the best digital card game, bar none. an active competitive scene with weekly tournaments, limited and constructed ladders to grind, fun decks to build, and good mechanics reminiscent to an improved m:tg, there is little to dislike about this game.the only downside to starting is the cumbersome tutorial, which i (like many others) are hoping will be reworked at some point. absolutely worth putting in the time to finish it and experience all that this game provides. if you like the genre, you're nuts not to give it a try.",1
16272,"looking at this game at first i could not for the life of me figure out how it would be entertaining, to be honest it looked stupid and boring. boy, was i wrong, it's basically a puzzle, memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery. once i found out what the game had to offer i was hooked. i find it quite good and a little addicting. it's very casual too, hop in for minutes or hour. it's not like most games out there that really impose on your time to get something done.the game is free, you only start with one gun but it's easy to get points to unlock other guns. so it's no where near a payplay. i have around guns now and enough points to probably buy two more guns depending on what i want. i actually feel quite guilty because i have not yet paid for on of the packs the game does offer which are around $. i mean it's so cool of a game that i'd like to support the development team.i don't know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it, learn from my mistake. i thought the game was stupid looking and almost passed it by but once i tried it i found out how great it is. don't make my mistake.at the very least yoou can learn how to take apart and then put back together an ak assault rifle or colt handgun :)",1
26910,"okay, but why? can we reasonably say that's because of actual difference in biological sexes, or is it possible that's because of the way society treats men and women differently? do women play fewer video games because they're inherently less interested, or is it because of the different societal pressures they face? young boys playing video games are treated as normal, while young girls who show an interest are often discouraged. here's an interesting bit of information: the primary reason men dominate the field of software development is because in the s, when personal computers were just becoming a thing, [they were marketed towards boys]( even *to this day* i see it all the time. young women who show an interested in computing, video games, or any other traditionally male hobby are often turned away from it, if not by adults than by their own peers. no one likes being told they're weird or stupid or abnormal for liking something, and young people especially will give up on those hobbies instead of pursuing them and tolerating the ridicule. it might be the case that there's some inherent difference in the way male and female brains perceive video games, but right now there's so much cultural bias getting in the way that it's virtually impossible to tell.",1

(hex, while a beautiful and intricate game, lacks the 'accessible' and 'intuitive' aspects that hearthstone and eternal meet)+++ the gameplay in eternal is rock-solid, taking core ccg mechanics and tying them to colors similar to mtg. currently the colors are not as stratified as mtg, which allows for more versatile single color decks, while offering expanded options for multi-colored decks. eternal (after my hours of play or so, so take it with a grain of salt) seems less focused on defining the metagame itself, unlike hearthstone (and to some extent mtg), where the meta (minus minor tweaking) is established within days of a new set coming out, largely by the developer. this is for reasons; the core mechanics introduced in hearthstone expansions are usually the most efficient (jades, single-copy bombs like reno and kazakus, etc), and the limited card pool simply doesn't allow much experimentation. although i'm just starting with eternal it appears that there is a decent range of creature removal, larger creatures and the like in each color, along with some strong (but not 'forced') themes like echo and void-play.++ while eternal has a mana mechanic, it is automated. this means the game sets your mana curve for you, limiting your optimal mana ratios. however, i assume they did it to remove complexity from deck-building, which is a good thing when trying to bring in more casual players. the game offers a plethora of mana-fixing cards as well, in both colorless and colored cards, to allow better control of your mana-flow. so far, i've only been mana-hosed on a couple of occasions...in most games mana has tended to be plentiful, often to the point of excess (as my early games tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient decks).+++ eternal thankfully does away with the tiny card packs of hearthstone and hex and has cards per pack, very close to the (minus the land) in a mtg pack. at $/pack, not counting the ability to draft, guantlet or forge for free cards/dust, the pack size/value ratio is exceptional compared to hex, mtgo and hearthstone.currently, the game modes available are gauntlet, forge, ranked and draft. as someone who likes to play mostly solo as i build a collection, the game modes are very close to perfect. gauntlet is a free pve constructed tournament mode and can be used to grind gold and some (usually common or uncommon) cards, with a perfect -win record earning a card pack as well. the ai modes seem well-designed to offer players good rewards as the player base could probably not accommodate pvp in each.forge is eternal's arena, a sealed-deck format where you build a deck from random sets of cards; again, the game assigns your mana. it appears (though i've only played once (but did get a perfect wins)) that once you have chosen colors of cards, all remaining picks are of those colors. this is a very nice feature and prevents someone from getting pretty far off-track into colors (though i am certain there are some who would actually like that). arena's cost gold to enter; the -win run earned me gold, a couple of cards, and card packs, so a little more than - value. you are allowed losses before your run ends; as you are playing an ai, it seems this mode offers a pretty fair chance to hit wins if you are good at sealed in ccg's. if the decks the ai is playing don't get more challenging as you rank up in forge, it should be pretty easy to go infinite.i've only played a few games of ranked, just enough to get a win for a quest, as i doubt i'm prepared to face constructed decks quite yet. the mode works fine, and even with only about k players online at any time, the matchmaking only took a little longer than hearthstone's. the 'casual' mode is currently offline, i am guessing until a larger player base means it won't cause extended queue times. i haven't drafted yet, but i will update my review when i do.overall, eternal is a great entry to the crowded online ccg market, and outside of hearthstone, might be the one to succeed with players who want something a little deeper than blizzard's game. the nitpicks i have with the game are minor...i think the art looks a little small on the play table (and i'm on a monitor), though it is fine when zoomed in. as a once-upon-a-time competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness, i prefer a hearthstone-style consistently building mana pool. however, it's not a game-breaker and i haven't noticed it being as much of a problem as i had in my ptq-qualifier days. if you are a magic player that wants deeper mechanics, but still slicked-up hearthstone-style experience, eternal is your game.",1

25170,"you are treated with respect, certainly more respect than your average man experiences online. the problem is that you choose to treat male attraction/attention as disrespect, or somehow feel entitled to a male-free and anti-male gaming spaces. maybe you just feel somehow above others and feel entitled being treated better than everyone else. either way, these are your own personal hang-ups and prejudices. >and honestly men like you drive the women away or force them to not use micsthere it is again, that gaslighting bully fallacy. women are not driven away from gaming, but they do come into gaming with a lot of pre-existing prejudices. you are just using whatever excuses you can find to justify your own misandry, toxic behaviour and attacks. vilifying men you resent for existing is a very easy way to do this.the fact is, most women do not like gaming and men who game(typically a hobby that is viewed as unmasculine, uncool or counter-productive to men's traditional gender roles of provider/protector). your own negative attitude towards male gamers is driving you away from using mics in games. not men. the excuses you come up with after the fact don't really match the reality of the situation. >that's half the reason it's such a boy's club in the first place, you scare more femme noobs away with your toxic bs.right, because i am addressing your prejudices, which are pre-existing, i am being toxic. and, no, women are not being scared off by men who are, in all reality, incredibly supportive and welcoming to women. you are literally attacking men right now for being attracted to female gamers and trying to engage them. most women are already taught to have a negative attitude towards gaming, and men in gaming, before they even pick up a controller. this is why men are usually excited or surprised when they meet women who aren't, and why women look for every reason not game(and then blame the men they are already taught to hate for it). i could easily make the case that hateful, petty, entitled and misandric women are far more to blame for women having these prejudices or driving new women away.",0

14493,"really want free jam to read this and new players to understand that i am speaking from a veteran's pov. this isn't meant to be a harsh. i want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. i can't recommend this game yet but i do encourage people to try it. robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before i can safely recommend it (i really enjoy the game, i want to emphasize that... i also want to emphasize that with each update, i have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). i want to give an overview of how i feel about robocraft and i will try to give an effective outline of what i want to say. this isn't me defending or bashing the game. this review is meant to be fair.i want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how i feel about it. i want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. i want to briefly mention the factory. i want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). i want to talk about some issues i have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical it sucks or i love crushing noobs or i get crushed by every meta/ pro user) and offer a solution. i want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. i want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. i want to talk about robocraft's community (there is might be some salt in here. be warned). finally, i will finalize with the largest problem i see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (if this is resolved, then i think it will help the game as a whole).the current movement system is very player friendly. you can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. i am not even joking. i made a ugandan knuckles fly. you can make tanks as well via tank treads. mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ rd person point of view games. camera controls are set as default to help people out. keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). i don't advise them in tier . heli-copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very overpowered. currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. my solution is that hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. insect legs are very bad. they don't do as their were originally intended to do. when i use them, even when i don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. they don't cling to ceilings. as a solution, i made insect bots that do these things but i had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (if interested, look up block widdow or the hanger in the factory, use keyboard controls). the hanger demonstrates perfectly what i want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. the block widdow demonstrates what i want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like the hanger is able to do. if insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. the current weapon balance in tier is... terrifying. the mega plasma (with the help of the trusty power module) can completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. the rail impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a rapid fire precision based weapon. the mega smg gun, well, its fine. the flak cannon is seriously weak. the loml deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. the mortar got nerfed hard, which i don't know how i feel about that since i started maining it until it got nerfed. the shotgun (ion distorter) feels useless. until weapons are balanced in way that is satisfying to free jam (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. i feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. i am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (i consider block spam as the control group in this position). p. s. t smgs need an increased fire rate.the factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. the factory made a war between fighters and builders. the fighters obviously win. i see far less builders than i do fighters in tier . the same goes to t. i don't think there should be t/t bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. i have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.in regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, i feel like they are too small. the old maps from the beginning, were really cool but i think free jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. i think there needs ro be more maps. more maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.in regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but i think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. when this game gets its player base up again, have a league mode where all teirs are meshed together. keep the current tier system the same. in regards to custom games, i think there should be a public/ private settings on it. i mean like allow people to random join. people will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. the matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. for when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.the community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. this will turn off new players to this game. i don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. when free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. free jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of the game is dead. other than that, the community is cool. lots of people are willing to help out. also, new players shouldn't be able to get access to t parts so easily.now to get to the root problem that plagues free jam. the main center of conflict that free jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. solutions? well i think if free jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. for content ideas, i would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. i would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. thank you for your time. i encourage free jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. again i can't recommend this game yet but i encourage people to try this game and share their views on it and to share ideas.",1

1975,"this review may cover both dota games, dota and dota . dota , in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, dota . i have played dota for more than years before transferring to dota . however, i only played this game because i thought it was far better than the previous game.it is, but it's partly not. -gameplay-the gameplay is just like any most other moba games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. personally, i have been a fan of moba games back then because moba games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.before moving to dota , the gameplay on dota is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and i got into it pretty fast. dota on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. in dota , the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to dota which requires right timing to actually execute a good play. but they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.not to mention, dota needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in dota , its just download, install, and play.-controls-dota basically has the same controls as dota , but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. you can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. back in dota , all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them. -community-well, its like in any other moba games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. but honestly, what really makes the dota fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-other things-since dota is a valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. the game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in dota itself. (i still watch on twitch though.) with these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for steam wallet. you can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.also, dota has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the dota community.(back in dota , you can only download the maps made by others.) certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-final notes-although dota is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes dota itself. i mean, how do you play this game without players, right? even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends. dota is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.i recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/moba games. i guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring.",1

7020,"the free campaign is great, greatly narrated and the choice cards are good, but the dark brotherhood expansion is a rip off.i spent money on having that expansion only to find that the computer cheats and the developers designed the challenges to be ungodly hard.for instance, oh warning spoilers though i'll try and be brief.you go to assassin's house, you either kill or talk, i chose talk, and you show him your skills. he not all that challenging.he gives you his contract and you get to go too two places, because he has to be at either places, i finally found the right place after a difficult battle. you go to assassinate him.turns out its a timed battle! which i hate, but oh no they don't stop there it gets even better! (you can't see the sarcasm but its there!) if you play in the left lane your shackled for a round, if you go on the right you can be knocked into the left lane. add a timer that cannot be removed or sent back to his hand! and the battle becomes a chore, i got him to of his health and he regens it back with health cards and minions that give him health. once again i say this to someone you shouldnt have time limits in a card game! especially because all strategy flies out the window, every deck is useless because if the time hits , you lose immediatly. and the way his ai is set up he dosn't attack your minions at all unless their guards, speaking of which he had all guard cards mostly, i nearly one but he cheated, and i'm serious i don't know if its a glitch or something but he pulled out a th version of a card that was a guard and i lost because i didn't have enough minions, it dosn't take ten turns to win a match unless the player is a even match against the cp!despite...all that i still reccomend the game, not because of the dlcs but because its still a good card game overall, just don't buy the darkbrotherhood dlc unless they post something saying the've nerfed it so people actually win.rant done. go play the free part of the game.",1

9177,"i have hust recently switched to playing the game on steam. with me having over , hours on the game with the client based launcher i highly admire all the effort that the team of the game has put into making this game a better experience for newer players. it is hard for a new player to get into a game like this because of the amout of people that are better than you. but it is different in this game when you go into a fight you are not just v ing someone all the time you have a part to do to be in a bigger team. it also makes the returing player experience better to with the introduction of the a.s.p system players have the chance of unlocking different playstyles that make the game more interesting. this gaame is not pay to win because all weapons can be purchased with certs also abilitys can also be purchased using the same curency. implants are items that can be used to give smaller perks to the player and make them more useful on the battlefield. the game still makes me fully emersed in the battles and i rarly get bored of what is going on. that is what i want to say to get new players back into the game, something we have been struggling to do in the pasty years. all my job is to help new players in the game and guide returning players into the meta. see you on the battlefield!!!",1

2116,"this is my absolute favorite arpg to play. i loved diablo . this game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique diablo / titan quest arpg. the rng is real, the challanges are fun. the content doesn't get dull. progression is limitless. knowledge is never ending. mechanics are so well done. the skills in this game are interesting. the ability to make any build you want is just simply the greatest. my cons: poor optimization, an ssd and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable fps.the highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. it's doable but likely expensive for solo players. not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.there is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. the lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't gamebreaking unless you have a bad pc.overall, if you've never played an aprg like this before, it make come off as too hard. the hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. what items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. all of this stuff simply takes time to understand. i've played this game since closed beta, on and off. i learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.this game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. this game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. this game is super competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.the content updates are constant, the gaming company, grinding gear games are simply the best of the best. on par with valve and sorta kinda blizzard--years-ago. there are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.if you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. but you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. this is always the biggest issue i see with new players. this is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to diablo . it isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.if you're my friend, hit me up, i will do everything i can to make you realize this game. it's fun, i love it. oh and it's % free to play. there is no pay to win. extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. that said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what stash player can compared to a fp stash tab. but it does make life easier.",1

8181,"oh where to begin with neverwinter. now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.neverwinter is a fp mmorpg published by perfect world. now a lot of perfect world games tend to be pay to win to the extreme. neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. the only thing to win in neverwinter is pvp, but pvp isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp. of course neverwinter has an in-game currency called zen that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing zen lets you buy are fashion items, dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. now of course like many other mmos, in game currencies like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. is that pay to win? no, it is not. what are you winning? a race to the quest area? people do not like spending real life money on mmos, but the game is free is it not? so complaining is silly. anways, the main currency in neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called astral diamonds. you don't want to spend real life money on neverwinter? have no fear, with ad you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. though for a price. k ad is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a % chance of obtaining a purple item. purple items sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to k or mill. so really, earning ad is not an issue. me? i've played neverwinter since beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items i desired. i just played the game and earned ad, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. the point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. but many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. i also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade ad for zen? isn't that nice that neverwinter allows you to do that? they give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. i don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a free game. in game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! now lets talk about the workers behind neverwinter that are really a great group of people. they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. the employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. its very important for a game to have that. they also play neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. how cool is that? they also stream on twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like t-shirts. so overall, neverwinter is one of the best free to play mmos out right now. there's a reason i've been playing this game since beta. it even has an epic story line unlike many other mmos that don't. like everybody else, i skip dialog, i don't care, i just want to play. with neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. don't believe me? check out my screenshots and look at my neverwinter ones. you'll also see that i have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning ad.like mmorpgs? want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? do you like dungeons and dragons? then take the time to play neverwinter",1

3023,"/ - yeah's pretty good.i guess i should probably say something about this game since my play time.i'll try keep it short but here goes.positives:-lots to do, lots to achieve. over vehicles. if you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as warframe or runescape (not as crazy as runescape though) this is a great time sink. it's kept my interest for a while now.-best pre-ww to cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soon) out there. it has its faults but compared to other free to games out there i honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. it becomes fulfilling -good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. runs well on most systems too.-free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. the options for free to play are quite forgiving.cons:-is. (hate that thing) in all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. it's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. updates are frequent and the pr has gotten much better, gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-you must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with american mid-tier planes (my god.) be prepared for people you can't rely on.tips:-you must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-don't claim russian bias when you die to a russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. i guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-is-'s, t's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -the youtube community is great for tips, i recommend slickbee, theorangedoom, napalmratte, phlydaily, squire, mcchickenbites to name a few.it's hard to condense what i think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then i do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. if you've played world of tanks or other free to plays that are around ww era this will stand out for you.thanks for reading this far. feel free to murder me in the comments.",1

5698,"excellent flight simulator. i have hundreds of hours on this game total, however switched from steam to the official launcher instead for better beta access and access to many more purchasble aircraft.some things to note about this simulator are:) this is a flight simulator, not an arcadey flying game. there are options to make the game easier, but i have not used them so i cannot speak on how it plays with those settings enabled.) as a flight simulator the learning curve is pretty immense. it takes many hours to get comfortable flying a specific aircraft and learning each specific thing it has to offer. this isn't even counting the time it takes to get used to the combat aspects.) the level of detail in the clickable cockpits is quite simply, amazing. having nearly every switch and system functional is something no other game offers to the extent dcs does.i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, yet rewarding flight simulator. would not recommend to anyone looking for games like ace combat (nothing wrong with those games, but it's not a simulator). i would also recommend anyone seriously consider buying this game to invest in a decent flight stick, as you pretty much need it.",1

14377,"the game was a lot better back in but the development team are amatuers at best. failure to learn from their mistakes (and there are many) which has been proven again and again over the years of updates i've suffered playing this game.match making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players. the outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design. the problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in (battle arena update) which broke the game (overclocking mechanic) and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times. the removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system, just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together. this relates to the poor match making.mega bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them. mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve.failure to add key features for the community like clans (this could make the game if they bothered to implement it)they treat the players/customers with little consideration when they release major changes. often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws.they only care about new players who spend real money. membership exists but it offers such poor value i suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer. if you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year. spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility.the most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item. the items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price. effectively you can grind the free to play model, convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crates/items for real money at extortionate rates. they have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players. this game is now looking more like 'free to install' and 'pay to compete'",0

13102,"this game is both fun and stupid. i recommend this game because you can play its full potential without paying*fun, cute little graphics with a familiar fallout theme. a slight tiny tower type of dweller management and room upgrades. an addition of quests, funny dialogue and sometimes difficult missions makes this game pretty dang enjoyable.i played this game as long as i did only to complete all achievements with that being said, i'm going to help you get them all.note: there is almost no way you can earn all achievements without paying (or cheating). i was able to get / by with some patience and allowing the game timer to run overnight and during the day. im only listing a few of the non-obvious achievements, or, some difficult ones with tips that might help you get them a bit faster. keep in mind to check your vault in the morning and at night. should take several weeks to complete them all.quest achievements:---big pharma (collect stimpacks)---decorator (collect all pieces of themes)---survivalist (complete quests)the key with these is to constantly have dwellers on quests at a time.time-consuming achievements:---fashion statement (collect legendary outfits)---armed and dangerous (collect legendary weapons)---interior designer (craft of every room theme)with these, keep x outfit and x weapon being made at all times. they must be legendary and keep in mind what type of special is needed to make it go faster (this depends on what you are making.) also keep the crafting room themes going at all times as well.the two hardest achievements:---get off my lawn (stop raider attacks)the reason im stating this as a hard achievement is because if you progress too fast, raider attacks become very few and far between; raider attacks depends on the quantity of dwellers you have. - dwellers = raider attacks. - dwellers = raider, ghoul attacks. + dwellers = raider, ghoul and deathclaw attacks.with this being said; + hours in, i stayed steady at about dwellers and completed all but the blast from the past and get off my lawn. i was at / attacks and i was only getting attacked by deathclaws. i saved my game, made a backup and evicted all but dwellers. i got attacked by raiders times within an hour. (changed the game to windows mode swapped from chrome to the game every min) a pain i know  but i recommend staying around dwellers until you get about raider attacks, then im sure youll get them all later---blast from the past (collect legendary dwellers)*ok, honesty time here. at about hours in; i was about to give up hope. i had two achievements left, get off my lawn and this one. also, at this point, i didnt spend a dime on the game. i researched how to get legendary dwellers and, besides earning or from quests, you can get them all from lunch boxes. so i thought to myself self, you threw down hours of free play, buy a few lunch boxes  however, $-$ bucks doesnt get you much, and what lunch boxes it got me didnt help. so i obtained a save file with lunch boxes and went to town opening- with lunch boxes, clicking to open them for several hours and bam, lunch boxes later, i got the achievement. so this means: (from my own experience) / = approx. .% drop rate per box * = , cards (there are cards per lunch box) / = approx. .% drop rate per cardthe reason im saying all this is because if you plan on buying lunch boxes just for this achievement, then you may want to rethink it. i also feel cheap cheating to earn achievements, but bethesda has earned enough of my money over the years. they can take one for the team; i sure the hell did with fallout",1

8270,"just started this game today and to be honest i wasn't really impressed. so far it's not really a bad game per say, it's just it seems so... dull for me. the action combat isn't all that actiony. not like other games such as dragon nest or tera.for me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. neverwinter simply did not thrill me. i dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. what is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? combat seems very clunky. i stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, it's just not for me.on top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily paywin as levels progress. while i may not have witnessed this first hand, i have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. boss mechanics consist of mostly cone / aoe then spawn adds. repeat process as difficulty increases. really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. check youtube videos, it's obvious.don't get me wrong, while i may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put me off from the game. there are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. while it's obviously harder for them, if you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. it's just annoying how much of an advantage paying does give you. overall i think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an equal fp experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else.",0

5739,"i am not an expert on flight simulators by any stretch of the imagination, so fair warning, i may be naive or ignorant in my assessment of this game. that said, by far i believe dcs world, and what i have seen of its addons including dcs: a-c warthog, to be the most comprehensive and realistic modern combat flight simulator series i have ever seen. many thanks to the developers for making the base game available for free on steam. there's a lot included in dcs world to appeal to both the hardcore flight simulation crowd and to educators.there are some minor omissions and simplifications from dcs world's default aircraft model, the su-, compared to its dlc packages in terms of the compexity of the cockpit's controls and graphical complexity, but what is available is so impressive to me i can't complain. even this simplified model is more complex than many flight sims i've experienced in the past.it's a good sign that some of the original companies which designed aircraft featured in this series are assisting with the development of the game/simulator, alongside the usual industry veterans. the sound design, user interface design, controls, mission editor and scripting system all seem to be quite well-executed. the game supports flightsticks, hotas and trackir, as well as (a rather inappropriate method of control in my opinion) the microsoft xbox controller alongside a mouse and keyboard.i've not yet completely explored what the game has to offer in terms of difficulty levels, or rather, aircraft simulation settings, but my advice is that people who are looking for a casual, pick-up-and-go flight simulator should do their research or probably look elsewhere, as the game may be far more complex than expected. that said, you can't beat the price, so i would insist that you test the game out and see what you think of it first. there's plenty of tutorials in-game as well as available on the internet to help you become accustomed to the su-'s basic startup/taxi/takeoff/landing procedures and usage in combat.if you are interested in online multiplayer, there is a thriving community of dcs world players online these days. i bet there's a wingman available to help you out.overall, at a first impression i consider dcs world and its expansions to be an excellent value for its cost. i look forward to buying the expansions.",1

16418,"i think this simulator has a lot of potential. gives you the info on how to disassemble and field clean your weapons. classes on how to disassemble weapons that are not your choice, cost a lot of money. $ is an amazing deal i think. you get all the weapons you could only dream of. cons: they do make you choose lower grade weapons and you have to spend your exp points to purchase some new weaponary. i have not purchased any of the items yet. pros: this simulator for weapons is very deep and teaches you everything you need to know about every weapon, or even a personal weapon you may have.keep in mind that this is a virtual simulator. you would be surprised on what some people think. it's not toilet reading material.",1

2004,"so currently i only have around hours and i am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.path of exile is fantastic. every steam owner should at one point or another try this game. however, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around hours to get there (for me at least). this game is basically the paladins to diablo. personally i think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.art stylein act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. i personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act being the nicest looking act thusfar. diablo i think should be a keymark for this. just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. poe is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. progressionok this is purely opinion based but i will try to be as objective as possible. diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. in this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. in poe it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. that being skills are merely items that you equip. this system allows for much more creativity but can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. in my personal opinion i think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. howeverpoe wins in the costumazation department purely because of the passive skill tree. holy crap. this skill tree. no barriers locked behind class walls. all classes can have any passive. that is so. refreshing. rarely ever do i see games do this and i still have no idea why. gameplaythis is an action rpg. meaning prepare yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. overall this is a must play. i intend to progress farther and play for engame content.",1

12690,this game would be great if it had mulitplayer.. or more then a single track and car to use. % of this game is micro transactions. everything costs money and even while i played with the only car you get for free on the only free track i still wasnt very impressed. the game is difficult to use and the menu screens are a wierd circle design which looked cool but made it very hard to read anything on the bottom because it was placed upside down. by the time you spent enough money to make this game worth playing yiu would have been able to get a much better racing simulator. if you want a racing game that wont break the bank i reccomend race it is under dollers on steam. its a much better value.,0

8976,"downloaded it a couple days ago, played hours straight, it's very smooth, addicting and huge mmofps, it isn't just a fps, the game works a lot like real war, infantry need air support and tank support to take locations, in total they're hundreds of locations to take, faction choices are more preference based then gameplay changing based, you get some different looking stuff and some factions have better stats towards items that there faction is advertised to be.you cannot log into this game as an experienced fps player and expect to go / score's like you might in cod or other related games, this game is about teamplay and stratergy, they're different unit types all of which can counter or push or '' sneak '' the enemy to help your team/group/unit/outfit (clan)/faction take an objective.i still don't fully understand the game which is a surprise since i'm one of those kind of / players when it comes to fps games on the pc, however this isn't a game where you call people noob or get godly scores, infact most people don't get good scores, the game says you can die a hundred different ways and it's practically true, the game is about the real-war vibe, soldiers attacking objectives, dying over and over until air and tank support finally take over.sound: / - very realistic and immersive, makes you feel like you're in an actual war with the lights off :pgameplay: / - can feel unfair at times, but the over-all goal and experienced is more then achieved by the game.combat: / - again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalanced, luck can help as-well as group play.air combat: - / - so realistic and responsive, requires a lot of learning and practice to dominate.tanks/etc - / very realistic but can't be effectively fired using third person, shutting you down from your surroundingpaywin? - this game is free to play, some guns are  cash only but a lot of guns are in-game credits, you will find yourself somewhat grinding here, i was only able to unlock some gun attatchments and upgrades after hours of gameplay, however the '' beginner '' guns are very good, they're not made crap to force you into buying, you could happily and easily use all the beginner items forever and be a good player, however i feel some cash guns do offer advantages but it's strange, the pace at which someone can die is never changed by the gun, some guns just assist the person, meaning if you're a good fps player it won't matter, if you're a new fps player or a bad one, you will often find yourself over-powered by cash users, over-all not anywhere close to pw.- ps, the sniper unit can cloak small vehicles and fire from them whilst remaining cloaked, sniper units can also use some rifles, being stealthed with a rifle for me is a broken aspect of this game and one i do not enjoy or support.- sniping, it's nothing like call of duty or other fps games so if you're a quickscoping fanboy don't bother with this game, sniping is very realistic, you have to aim where your opponent will be, bullet travel time and distance vastly affects your aim, also most beginner snipers do not one shot unless headshot, but do lot's of high damage, which is how it should be, like air combat, sniping actually requires practice.over-all rating: / - completely free to play, no hackers that are overkilling the game, lots of stratergy, groups and action, not paywin, addictive and balanced, feels like cod + battlefield, best of both worlds, with slightly less graphics compared to say battlefield, i'd say on max settings this makes any cod game look '' simular ''.graphics: i have a msi nvidia gtx over-clocked at maximum overclock and i get - fps with very high settings in fights of - or -, i get about - fps in fights of - and - in fights of - and +the textures of the game are somewhat '' ugly '' compared to other games, but this is often misunderstood as a bad thing, you have to load about - players in one somewhat small objective area at one given time, including the sky, the tanks and turrets, mines, the map itself, the rocks and map design and fillers including helicopters etc all moving at once, i feel the textures are bad for a reason, the game is unplayable on any standard/none gaming gpu, (amd/nvidia) is required at atleast about + per gpu ( gpu's) or + for one gpu to run the game at an eye pleasing level.",1

2251,"might just be the best fp game i've ever played. looks gorgeous, sounds pleasantly, runs smoothly, feels very good to play. there is certainly a cathartic oomph to the combat and the killing. also, the fp model is possibly the most honorable. the only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.there's a choice of classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' diablo : templar, shadow, marauder, ranger, duelist and witch. unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. the latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for dexterity, red for strength and blue for intelligence.each class has initial direct paths of skills. a ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. and at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail.this might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out.lastly, i've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.heartily reccommended to any diablo player!",1

2636,"the good: game is marvelpiece from technical standpoint - beautiful graphics, good sound and all is well optimised. tank and aircraft models are very detailed, there is considerable customisation as well. plethora of vehicles, real and paper projects to toy with.the bad: balance isn't the best, with worst offender being top tiers, particularly jets. aircraft gameplay resolves around destroying ground targets, so if you're up for fighter to fighter combat, you won't win many games. tank gameplay is one shot in nature, as often single penetrating shell is enough to kill crew and/or detonate ammo racks, which leads to rather campy gameplay. arcade mode with its respawn is both boon and curse - if one team collapses, it inevitably leads to spawnkilling. realistic is aquired taste, unfortunately driving/flying for few minutes only to die in boom isn't exactly my flavor.the ugly: grind. on positive, you can research entire tech tree using only one vehicle. in theory, in practice its unlikely to happen before heat death of universe. player progress is deliberately slowed down by need to research and buy at least vehicles of current tier before progressing, which doesn't stop less competent players from playing more advanced toys. obtaining your oh so expected new toy, be it tank or plane is only the beginning - after all you've bought junk of a vehicle and you need to upgrade it and with tanks (and upcoming warships) its especially bad. you can't repair your tank and you can't extinguish fires without researched spare parts and fire ex. while on low level vehicles its matter of few battles to get these, on top tiers it can take well over battles to get anything, with hundreds of battles needed to unlock all upgrades.pw - while there are no premium vehicles that are straight up overpowered (at least i'm not aware of them), there are plenty of options to gain advantage with open wallet. first - instantly buying upgrades for vehicles, its not so much pw as its sanity saviour, especially on high tier vehicles. second - crew. for gold eagles you can level up crew considerably, especially in sensitive aspects like vitality or reload speed. third - increasing vehicle rooster. free player can bring up to vehicles into battle, paying player can bring . so should arcade air prove so hectic, paying player can in theory outlast non paying ones. arcade tanks are limited to vehicles, so no issue there if one can prepare his/her lineups correctly.tl;dr if you can accept grind and/or limiting yourself to early vehicles and you're willing to learn basics (especially air combat), go for it.",0

14525,"i got this game as a gift several months ago. when i got the game, i encountered a game of creativity and of combat, which i liked. the game's ranking system made sure you were matched with comparable bots with comparable armaments, which resulted in fairly intense matches with two nearly equally matched teams. however, as of the latest big update, the game suffers from a horrible game balance issue. weapons are now handed out at random, and 'rare' weapons are able to unilaterally dominate battles. the new crate system intends to reward good gameplay, but the tiering of crates is largely cosmetic, with the highest teir gear being practically the same rarity in low tier crates as in high tier crates. their rarity is hardly a justificaton for the weapons' power, especially since for a few bucks, people can buy the highest tier crates. robocraft discourages new players by pitting them against the power weapons with little to defend themselves. robocraft discourages the creative process by making roughly three styles of vehicles the only survivable ones, and by making the power weapons so costly to add to a bot (in terms of pflops, the game's unit of bot complexity) that if a bot is to be effective, it must be extremely basic with a power weapon on it. robocraft discourages veterans of the game by making the level system and robot rank system nearly obsolete, turning the game's tech tree into a game of chance. the power weapons were originally only available by purchase, so the update did do good by taking previous 'pay to win' weapons and making them at least remotely accessible for free. but robocraft is no longer a game of skill and creativity. its balancing points have become a wheel of fortune, a wheel that can be greased by money (that runs a risk of being wasted since rarities still exist in the purchasable crates).in short, the game used to be fun. once again in gaming history, crates corrupted the game.",0

7004,"overall pretty good game for a card game, similar to hearthstone but based off the elder scrolls world. so if you know that world better than wow, this might be the game for you. the pve side of it is pretty good as well, provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you dont want to, thanks to the pve arena.biggest downfall which i very dislike, you cant create the cards that are in special bundles. so of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game. the reason i want to highlight this out is because they have a description for the madhouse bundle stating: we've added some cards thatll really help balance out certain decks and help the game. but you have to pay $ just to get a bundle of cards.regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help maintane a competive advantage with exclusive/op cards, the games fun in its simple form. also im sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said op cards. i give the game total a / due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap. (cuz revenue is always better than player experience, we all know how the business world works). if your ok with spending money on digital cards, the game deserves / for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games.this last paragraph is edited: as necrophagist pointed out, u can use your ingame gold to purchase said content above. which is a good alternative, it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content. so i've decided to change the total rating to / due to that alternative.",1

3873,"i have one very specific complaint now.the new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my tf experience. introducing the forced bo format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. and most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.now why do i hate this? the old tf was unique to me in that when i went into a game, probably on a server i knew and had in favourites, i could meet or make some friends or rivals. and the rivalry has been the key concept of tf since its beginning -- might i remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.in the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if i'm going to be playing with different people minutes from now. but marekk you old , why not go to a community server if you like them so much? well tell you what, community servers are dead, and not without help from the official servers' availability. of course, official infrastructure is a blessing. and it was working perfectly well for a long time before this new matchmaking arrived, and it was great.but what did we trade that for? the god awful meaningless badges that you can tap on in the menu to make a funny noise?i feel like we're all strangers now in this game... ;_;",0

7374,"tl;dr - it's hearthstone, but with all personality removed.tes: legends falls into the same trap so many other ccgs have - it's not a game anyone actually wanted to make, so they just took some mechanics from existing games, slapped some differnt pictures on the cards and called it a day. mechanically, it's perfectly functional; the interface is clean and works nicely, while games flow pretty quickly and will usually take no more than - minutes. the single-player campaign serves as a tutorial that introcudes the mechanics for those who haven't played similar games, but if you've seem almost any ccg before you'll quickly get bored as you're forced to play an hour or so of easy games just to unlock the rest of the game.as for the mechanics themselves, it really is almost all just a copy and paste of hearthstone. you gain mana each turn with no need for lands or similar, you play mainly creatures which can choose to attack either each other or the hero, you also get spells which are the usual damage, debuffs, and so on, and you have extremely minimal interaction during your opponents turn. pretty much all creature abilities are taken directly from hearthstone (charge, deathrattle, etc.), with the exception of trample taken from mtg (mtg itself has far more abilities, so it's clear which game was being copied here). you even start with health and have decks with a default of cards.there are precisely two things in the game that aren't identical to hearthstone. firstly, the board is (usually, although not always in single player) split into two lanes, with creatures in a lane only able to attack other creatures in that lane. in single player sometimes the lanes will offer different effects, but in most games it's simply one normal and one that gies creatures stealth for a turn. in theory this is supposed to open up more tactical choices, but in practice it really just brings the game more similar to mtg by opening up a bit more freedom in attack and defence. it at least makes things a little different from hearthstone, but it still doesn't bring anything actually new to the table. the second part, which might actually be original, is that each time you take damage (relative to your starting health, so healing will delay it), you draw a card. this makes rush decks slightly less powerful and opens a bit more possibility for comebacks - a player who falls behind early can end up with a card advantage which is quite a lot in games like this - but it doesn't really change the game in any significant manner. related to this is the equivalent of hearthstone secrets which give the sole interactivity during an opponent's turn. when drawing a card due to damage, if it has the prophecy ability you can play it immediately at no cost. unlike hearthstone and mtg, neither you nor your opponent have any idea if or when this will happen, so while this can be quite powerful, it's extremely unpredictable and impossible to plan around. it's at least the one thing not ripped directly from another game, but it's really not an improvement.there are no heroes as in hearthstone, but rather classes that combine two card colours. each colour focusses on certain things, such as big creatures for red or spells for blue, but other than restricting which cards you can put in a deck that's the only effect classes have. if this sounds similar to mtg, that's because once again it's essentially identical, other than restricting you more than mtg does in exactly the same way that many recent ccgs have done. the influence of hearthstone can really be seen with some of the colours, such as yellow focussing on summoning lots of small creatures and then buffing them, to the point it couldn't have been any more obvious what they were copying if they'd actually name the tokens silver hand recruit.as for the game types and free-to-play model, again, see hearthstone. you have single player tutorial/practice mode, adventures (one available so far), online ranked matches and arena. packs and arena even cost exactly the same as in hearthstone, and you can disenchant and craft cards in exactly the same way. as a new game, it's not really possible to comment on how fair progression is; there are nowhere near as many cards available as older games so the ability to get a decent number of cards early on doesn't mean much. this question can only be answered over the next few months and years as it becomes clear if (and how much) money is needed to have a decent chance of competing, or at least having fun as a new player.finally, where the game really falls down is its utter lack of character. the strength of the tes games has always been in the writing and the interaction of the player with the world. the world itself is just a rather generic fantasy setting with your standard elves and cat people and so on, and since each game has been set in a different time and covered different events, there aren't really any established characters, places, famous weapons, and so on. this means that unlike hearthstone, where many cards are recognisable and themed arpound their lore, and legendaries are well known bosses and important characters, cards in tes:l range from generic elf to the legendary slightly different generic elf. the lack of animations (plenty of particle effects but no actual movement) just makes it worse - instead of dropping ragnaros with a big thump and burst of fire, you just place a card with a picture of an elf on it. if you care about tes lore, this game won't offer you anything recognisable or anything new. if you don't already care about tes lore, this game is certainly not going to get you interested in it. it's a functional, generic fantasy ccg with mechanics copied directly from other ccgs, mainly hearthstone with a bit of mtg, and a total lack of any character or anything of interest to recommend it over the many other similar games currently on offer. it doesn't offer new and interesting gameplay, it doesn't offer interesting characters or gripping story, it doesn't connect in any way to previous tes games, it just exists for the sake of having a ccg with the tes name attached to it.",0

7181,"i've been putting off writing a review for this game for a while. i felt, as a tcg, in order to get an accurate grasp on the game i needed to play a lot. i've gotten to level of , own all dlc, and have collected a good portion of the cards in the game at the moment. here are some notes:value. you do not need to pay a dime if you do not want to and you could (hypothetically) get as much out of this game as someone who pays to win. there is in-game currency in the form of both gold and soulgems; the former is used to buy packs, decks, dlc, enter drafts, ext. it can buy most things (aside from some promo content). you rack up gold just by playing the game, or even watching streamers play it on twitch. the soulgems are used to craft specific cards, allowing you to avoid buying hoardes of packs just to get a couple singles you are chasing. along side all of this, you now get daily rewards just from logging on, along with daily quests you can complete for gold. all in all, very satisfied with the ingame currency and microtransaction system used for this game; balanced, fair, and well worth.content. even though the game only has sets out (excluding dark brotherhood and other promo/dlc content), the variety of gameplay along with modes of play is vast. it is a brewers paradise for constructed, and the draft system in great and very easy to get the gold to play. there are even quest story lines which implement various gameplay changes to make the experience feel unique and fresh. my only complaint with the current meta is it vastly favours the late-game. aggro is very hard to make work, usually relying on the other decks inconsistencies and luck. prophecies, while a good idea on paper, do not help with this, resulting in one of the only succesful aggro decks in competeitve right now to also bank on prophecies. hopefully in the future, as with many other tcg's, more cards will eventually lead to more viable early game and thus better aggro in the meta. for now, expect board wipes, ramp, and boardclogs.flavor. god i love the elder scrolls series and the universe it encompases. every card is beleivable in regards to tes lore and feel. if you like the idea of getting into a strategy card game and love tes, this is your opening.all in all, i like the game. i still think my tcg of choice is magic, but this still takes a good cut of my dedication and resources due to the uniqueness of it. very standout game, worth a few hours of your time to give it a try.",1

1022,"i really liked the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ships so overall a fantastic space shooter that i've been looking for, however two things i found lacking on a first impression and limited play. first off in general i felt it was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. and second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability. of course i only played about an hour, so i may be missing some of what the game has to offer, this is just first impressions.",1

3293,"for a fp battle royale, this has a surprising amount of polish and is surprisingly fun.before getting into the game itself, you have an indepth character customization system that allows you to very slightly change the way your character looks. unfortunately, you can't make your character look not asian which is a bit disappointing. you also have cosmetics which you can unlock using crates that you can purchase pubg style without the need for keys. these crates can be purchased with the credits you earn by playing the game.let me say that this is one of the more fun oriented battle royale games. aside from your standard battle royale fare, you can also do any of the following; go snowboarding, climb mountains, paraglide, drive monster trucks, drive snowmobiles, ride trams, and go sailing. when you find yourself in those boring moments moving between areas, you might be able to get the chance to do any of these things.into the game itself, you can spawn wherever you like without the fear of someone nailing you immediately, unless you choose to spawn right beside someone else on the map. once you take the spot, the spot is yours and yours only. personally, i don't care too much for this since i enjoy the surprise encounters and bloody deathmatches that comes with the classic battle royale formula of parachuting onto your spot of choice. however, it makes sense within the context of the game's lore where you're a tourist trying to escape a deadly snowstorm.the gameplay is very solid, but does need improvements. each type of weapon has its strengths and weaknesses. smg's are extremely powerful close range, rifles are best suited for mid-range, snipers for long range, and shotguns to make close quarter combat situations end quickly. the balance is lost due to how the weapons work. most importantly, the mp and the mpx are stupidly powerful. if you or someone else were to go up against another player in a close or mid range combat situation, the smg will most certainly win. with full armor, the mp or mpx can take someone down much more quickly than with a rifle. the smg's lack of recoil also makes it superior in mid-range combat situations since it doesn't appear to have any damage drop off from a distance. this dominance by the smg's make the rifle class weapons the most suitable one at very specific ranges, or for picking at moving targets from a long distance. i'm not a fan of rifles not objectively being the best weapon in the game, but if i were to play devil's advocate, i'd say it makes the game more balanced and encourages players to have all of their weapon slots filled up with a close, mid range, and long range weapon.although the game has many of its own features, it does lack a few others, such as upgradable inventory space, free leaning, being able to look around while running, and others i can't quite think of at the moment. the way the map shrinks is also strange, instead of having a big circle it takes specifically outlined pieces of the game world to become danger zones. while i might prefer more traditional battle royale game design, roe's take on the genre helps it stand out of the crowd when it comes to its core gameplay.which, speaking of gameplay, is something i have come to like a lot. it's not as tactical as pubg or as arcadey as fortnite, but it offers a fine balance between the two. it manages to juggle fun game concepts while providing competition worthy movement and shooting mechanics. if there's anything to criticize, its the way recoil works. maybe it's because i've only spent ten hours in the game so far, but the mechanics of controlling recoil doesn't seem to be clear aside from simply tapping the fire button to keep one's accuracy, which even pubg doesn't force players to deal with.the map itself is very well designed, probably the best designed br map i've ever gotten to play on. each location on the map is intricately designed to utilize the three 'classes' in the game; the hang glider, the snow boarder, and the rock climber. there are many inclines to snowboard from as well as mountains and buildings to climb or hang glide from. the varying areas also have their own identity. while games like pubg and fortnite will reuse buildings and assets, the different areas will, more often than not, have sections where most buildings are completely unique from the rest of the game world. as i've stated before, moving around in the game is much less of a drag considering the many ways of travel i've listed in the game.lastly, being an early access game, the netcode and polish this game has surpasses pubg by a large margin. i've probably ran into maybe two bugs and one moment where i felt like a shot i fired off should have hit when it didn't, whereas pubg feels more like eurojank despite it being developed in the usa and korea. so far i'm very impressed with how smoothly the game runs and i have high hopes for the game's success.this is a battle royale i feel has not only a very unique identity, but is also a very fun take on the genre compared to its slower, more tactical counterparts, while still retaining serious competitive aspects that more casual br games don't posess.it's free. play it.",1

14949,"i genuinely used to love this game when it was first brought out. it was fun, innovative and hilarious to see some of the creations players came up with. it was a good mix of builder as well as fps. i don't know what they were thinking when they made the more recent changes but the game has definitely lost a lot of what made it fun.one of the aspects they removed which i particularly liked was the way their premium worked. it used to be that anyone in your battle who had premium would increase everyone's reward by %; this was very, very sadly removed. this made buying premium feel like it was worth it as everyone benefited from it, but now premium users only receive more junk in their crates, which is more often than not just as useless.the new loot crate system they have in place feels a lot like its starving players. as an established player i can't imagine how anyone new to this game will be able to make anything capable of standing up to other established players. barely anything of use is rewarded meaning you have to spend a lot more time in game to be able to even earn simple upgrades for your bot. salvaging is a painful waste as well as you receive so little currency in return for anything you might not need, and even then you're scrimping through your supplies to find something you can spare to salvage. everything is stupidly expensive from this perspective as you make so little from salvaging that even purchasing building blocks is painful. you really do need to rely on whatever rewards you earn making it difficult and very time consuming. you can purchase the best crates from the store but this is a money drain as they too aren't guaranteed to give you anything of use.the weapons feel highly unbalanced as anything with high power has a very high cost of energy, often leaving you defenceless. there isn't a tech tree anymore either, so (in my opinion) levelling feels very tedious. i have no desire to level as it feels like i'm not being rewarded and often just feels like work. you don't often earn much in the way of experience from the battle modes, making the most effective means of levelling the solo player mode which strips it of its multiplayer aspect. you can earn a bit more experience from the arena modes, however, due to the weapons, these too feel very unbalanced. more often than not you are up against established players with much better weapons and the more elite items available, e.g. the power shields, so beginner players often don't stand a chance.the megabots were one of the best parts of the game and they too were removed. they offered a direction for battle which was good aspect as it felt like there was a leader. having someone to follow and support more often helped the game's direction. their components however remain in game but at stupidly high costs for both in game currency and pflop requirements which makes them almost pointless, as you often can't afford to equip them even if you could afford to purchase them. so established players also hold this over beginning players as they have these mega weapons and beginning players are less likely to ever get them.from the outside it seems a lot like the developers are trying to cater to the more negative comments from players and the robocraft community. it's been stripped, twisted and turned into something that feels almost like an entirely different game to how it was. it's a shame to see what it's become, as it really did start off going from strength to strength only to hit this very disappointing low.summary- paid premium is almost useless and only gives premium users an extra chance at useless junk in their loot crates.- loot crates offer very little of anything useful and purchasing premium crates doesn't guarantee useful equipment which is starving new players. it's near impossible to build or upgrade bots unless you put in very large amounts of time.- salvaging for currency is a joke; salvaging only returns a very minimal amount of currency making it nearly impossible to purchase items. this along with the very random, often useless returns from the loot crate means nothing you receive is worth salvaging, and if it is, is too badly needed to afford being salvaged.- megabots were removed, but their components are still in game but aren't cost or pflop efficient. this took out a big, fun part of the feel of robocraft.",0
13191,"i'd like to give this a neutral review but since that's not an option, i'll give a slight recommendation.first, i'd like to address the elephant in the room. this game was originally developed for tablet, which, as you should know, means that if you expect a real game, you're gonna be disappointed. if you want a real game that you can play for at least two to five hours without taking a break or getting bored, you may wanna take a look at sheltered or something similar. generally, it's a good idea to stay away from fp or tablet games if you want a real game. also, obviously, the controls are mediocre at best and annoying at worst, it really shows that it wasn't originally designed for pc.ok, now that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review part. the core gameplay mechanics seem pretty generic, as it can be expected from a fp game. that's not really a bad thing though since it's basically a waiting game which means it is expected to deal with pretty basic mechanics. click on things to collect resources and items, click on people to let them level up, and so on. if you want to loose, you have to try very hard (if it's even possible to let everyone in your vault die, unless you play on survival), if you want to win you have to spend money or play for a very long time (what i mean by winning is having built everything that you want to build). nothing new.the game will continue to run if you are logged out, and obviously while you're not online, you won't be able to collect anything. that is also not really bad though because after a short while, the resource consumption will be halted. so you will have a little less resources when you log back in but they won't be completely depleted.generally, if you don't want to spend money on it, it seems to be a good idea to just log in every couple of hours, collect everything, send some people on quests, start a new weapon/armor production, maybe use speed-mode a couple of times to get a few caps and fill your resource-storage faster and once everything seems good, you can log out again. just don't forget to check your statistics-screen every once in a while, to make sure that your production per minute is still higher than your consumption per minute.also, there are a couple bugs, crashes and other issues. if you decide to play this game, maybe you have already played some early access titles where the developers simply stopped to care and never fixed any bugs or anything? this game will remind you of that. there is absolutely no communication from the developer, certain bugs have been known for years but no one cared enough to fix them. after a simple look at the discussions you will also probably find that you shouldn't get too attatched to your vault and definitely shouldn't spend any money on it. almost every day i looked, there has been at least one thread on front page complaining about the game being unplayable due to crashes/freezes/etc or the save file being corrupted/disappeared. so it definitely is a bit of a gamble.if everything works and you are lucky enough to not run into any game breaking bugs it can be fun but that is definitely not guaranteed. so if you like waiting games you can definitely give it a try but i would strongly suggest to not support the developer by buying anything in this game until they start to care a little bit more and fix bugs and other problems.",0

12776,"drives well, feels good. had lots of fun with the hill climb! many little details that i could appreciate, much love. however, dodging a bunch of handicapped people who managed to flip their car every qualifying session's t, making you swerve and get your lap invalidated gets very tiring after not even a day. i started off with a pad, then upgraded and it feels great with a wheel but there's so many bad drivers around i've uninstalled the whole thing, which brings me to another point (gb for only a few cars and tracks you can actually use). in races you'll just get rammed off and you can just sit through minutes of practice and qualifying again. afterwards, no matter where you start, you'll get hit. good game, bad players and bad measures against them. i've encountered some very sportsmanlike people as well, both in victory and defeat in terms of yielding or just cleanly passing you with superior pace. i suppose the fp model cuts both ways, you can give it a try but it attracts not-so serious players that'll ruin your experience. getting the other cars and tracks to escape the fp camp is probably more pricey in the end than getting a full game so this is a no for me in the end.",0

9229,"having only put hours into this game, i thoroughly enjoy planetside . if you're into a more futuristic fps, then this game is right up your alley. i love the big battles that you can get into sometimes. i also like the different factions, although i feel the new conglomerate is underpowered at times. i've only played as the new conglomerate and the vanu sovereignty, but i enjoy playing as them (maybe the vanu sovereignty more :). the gameplay feels authentic sometimes. there's just a thrill that you get from the constant explosions all around and bullets whizzing past. the one problem that i have with this game is the grind. it takes a long time to get enough certs to buy what you want, and then get them all back by grinding again just to get another item that you want. planetside does have a membership that you can pay to get more xp and certs, but you don't need to necessarily buy it unless you don't have enough time to grind. this game isn't pay to win, most of the items that cost currency that you can buy are just cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon skins, voice packs, etc. all in all, i do believe that planetside is a great game that everyone should give a try, and then put an hour or so into the game and see how you feel after that. i hope this review interested you in trying out planetside . thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. :)",1

8917,"oh, planetside . how glorious you are. massive , player servers, spread across different continents and across warring factions, oh glory be.being a fp game (free to play), you don't have a reason to at least not try the game out. that is if your computer can handle it. previously, the game was extremely poorly optimized for amd cpu's, and t hat has recently changed. where i was once getting frames in large biodome fights, i'm now giving it bonus points.now, the game is an infantry-vehicular combat game. the factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains. every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier, you use infantry resources, same goes with c, personal med-kits and the highly useful and badass max suits. vehicles take the apropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it, cost more.now, the three factions are all similar yet very different, both aesthetically and performance wise. the new conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the vannu sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy, no bullet drop but dow low damage. each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane, heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well.now, planetside is a free-to-play title, but don't let that scare you away. most games have a pay-to-win model to be more precise, whre as long as you just dump money into the game, you will have much improved gear over others, and this is why most fp games fail, but not ps. the only thing real money is good for in ps is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowence of sc (station cash) per month and an xp and cert bonus. certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while sc is used to purchase weapons skipping the arning of certs as well as customization options such as camos, helmets, and emblems on your soldier and vehicles.you can not buy certs outright, which is where the balancing is. each weapoin can be moddified heavily with weapoin attatchments which alter their performance drastically from x red dot sights to x sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips. it all depends. these are purchased using certs. you earn cert per xp in game. while the weapon may be bought with sc and skip the cert price point, the attachments must be earned through play.i know this review is all over the place, but if you like fps's on a massive scale, skip that battlefield player nonsense and jump right inot an amazing free game, planetside .",1

5339,"i've been playing the world of tanks series of games (started out with normal world of tanks for the pc, calling wotm for now) for almost years, and wotb is quite a fun replacment. i lost my interest in wotm because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, i used the arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but i am skeptical), and when i was watching videos on wotb, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and i desided to try it out, and i found it to be quite fun, and i have been playing it non-stop ever sense. pros: smaller matches compaired to wotm means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. new equipment system: many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. and i will say, at first, i absolutly hated it. the new system allows players to mount different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for spare parts. many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind igc (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the gun stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier + tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:there are tons of tanks in here, just like wotm, bar arty. if you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. if you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. if you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for tank destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. and as the game is still improving just like wotm, more tanks are in the future. good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as hd as wotm, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but i am not into games for fancy graphics, i play for gameplay.cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.cons:smaller matches compaired to wotm. although it has it's perks, if you come from wotm, you might have some withdrawls from the old v and have to deal with the v .spare parts system: although the new equipment system is good, i will say that the spare parts system is somewhat flawed. we should at least earn spare parts for a victory and maybe for a loss. i've only won about for a victory. this makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. the only way to get more than k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every - hours (forgot which lol) to be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - update . claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. overpowered tanks: although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a tiger ii in real life would blow away a sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. some notable tanks are the leopard light tank of tier , kv- of tier , lttb of tier to name a few. what makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the leopard only had varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. the kv- in game can shot anything at tier and below when using the mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. lttb reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. the lttb is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has mm of hull armor. i don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) however, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. kv- has an insanely long reload (upwords of + seconds), and the lttb is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.there is also somewhat of a russian bias with this game, and many of the russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the german tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the german tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. and yes, i am parcial to german tanks, but i also use british, american, and russian, so this is from personal experience. the new millitary honor system:absolute *** in my eyes. i've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and i don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily i might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of this new millitary honor system, you're honor stars go down because random players think you're botting, or afking when you could have issues like i am experiencing. in my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. and my final and main issue with the game: no three man platoons like normal wotm - i understand that v might be difficult to have man platoons, but we need something cause man platoons is just too small. all i can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on wotb for man platoons for those that agree with this.another thing for new players is don't judge the game until you're at least at tier , and this goes for wotm as well. i've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. it's not just point and click and get a kill (unless you're an old arty or kv-, then it sometime is). there is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called sidescraping, and many other things that will help you survive in battle. learn you tank too. a panzer iv will have a completely different playstyle than a t heavy or kv- (these are all tier s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. note: these are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. and that concludes this long winded review.",1

antichrist will be crowned in this temple; during crowning, he won't read the belief prayer correctly (rejecting christ and acknowledging himself); when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show), many people will see his big nails and will reject him; patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist; antichrist will kill him. also, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the th wolf council; others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. roman catholics, satanists, and buddhists use the same mudras; if you see these mudras on an icon, then it's not orthodox icon; orthodox icon has ic xc symbol (jesus christ). roman catholics pay drunks and strippers to pose for icons; passions of drunks and strippers transfer to those who pray to these images. normal orthodox icons are inspired by the holy spirit. gaad in ruski = satan; hence, americans = blasphemers because they always say: oh, my god!. santa (word for saint in satanic languages) = satan; hence, spanish + italian + portuguese = blasphemers. anathema to satanic languages; triple anathema. learn church slavonic; no curses in it; curses = prayer to satan. all religions except orthodoxy worship satan. on bread for communion: ic xc nika (jesus christ conquers) plus cross = orthodox; hexagram plus dusha maya = antichrist. jews and muslims pray head down (either standing, bowing, or kneeling); this is satanic prayer. orthodox look into the eyes of icon; energy goes their way; they get healed; head and shoulders come together to reject satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to christ and not the devil. hands cannot be on groin or behind back; either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. clergy who will not put buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood will be killed; only churches will be left as pelageya of ryazan predicted. in and at other meetings, fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same supreme being; triple anathema; don't let heretics tell you what to do. america will be last country to switch to euro. three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; st big earthquake in russia; nd (bigger one) in china; rd (biggest of the three) will be in america. nato will nuke ukraine to blame russia for it; then nato will nuke russia from scandinavia. china will attack russia; but will not get past ural mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against chinese soldiers (they will run back to china and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze siberia to - celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). russia will destroy turkey and america. china will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. only eurasia and alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and greenland melts. move to ural mountains or inland alaska. sionists wanted war between russia and germany from june th to october th on their holidays because ( times )+( times ) = (in their twisted logic). tube people = demons. clones = demons. human costumes that demons wear = demons. dinosaurs and ed people have triple stranded dna; normal person can't swallow ed food (designed for ed people). demons live inside clones. bacteriologist alexandre yersin (who discovered bubonic plague) is depicted on the shroud of turin. there is another shroud (shroud of milan) on which blasphemer yosef (who was crucified on a pole in ad) is depicted. menachem mendel schneerson, lenin (el=deity in hebrew, nine = no in german; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the creator), and yosef were possessed by azazel; now, rico cortes is possessed by azazel. ww happens; % of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. isis stands for israeli secret intelligence service. next false flag: statue of liberty in order to attack iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis km high). wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. all metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug dna, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru ivs, implants, fillings, etc. if - nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. seraphim of sarov and sergiy of radonezh will be resurrected after ww for a short time; seraphim of sarov will show the new ruski tsar who will fight the antichrist for about years and months. those who go see seraphim of sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. earth is flat; stands on pillars (the most holy trinity); pillars stand on water at zero kelvin. zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. sleep fully clothed; pray the jesus prayer. pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. humans were created about years ago. ruski orthodox christian vyacheslav krasheninnikov was the last prophet before enoch and elijah return to preach against the antichrist. birds participate in time creation. it's a sin to kill birds. dinosaurs live under our level. they will get out through sinkholes and lakes. to kill them, go for their nerves. save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. first dinosaur will come out of volga river in russia. demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. demons will invite people to be healed inside their ufos; those who go will be like zombies after. gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. if you're being abducted, slowly pray the jesus prayer. don't panic. demons use diamonds and souls to power their ufo craft. the bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. demons have ufo bases: )moon )inside fake mountain kailash in tibet )in lake baikal in russia )in atlantis which is underneath the mariana trench in pacific ocean. there are no aliens. nobody lives on other planets. airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight jesus. antichrist is pale with red eyes. he's possessed by satan since he's years old. he flies very fast; deceived people will say that christ is here; christ is there. sometimes, he wears blue robe over left shoulder while red robe is underneath. he wears gloves to hide long nails. he's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.",1

1879,"i'll give a thumbs up only because the game itself is pretty good, but this is not an actual review, its more like a short summary about my over hours spent into this game (lol nb cant write until kh noob). i started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum i post on play this. so i started playing it both with my friends and solo. today at the end of my very last match(which i lost) i realized that i have never had fun in this game. i mean, out of hours i can only remember like, - really funny moments where i actually laughed.oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. i was earthshaker top dire in lane with warlock against death prophet and batrider, we got first blood like seconds after the : mark, i spotted dp warding our jungle, i used fissure to block her escape way and warlock used shadow word. while we were aa her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early xvi century in france, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes i know, my interests are ed up), and that actually made me laugh, that to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that dp started dancing while we were beating her up. this made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! focus!there's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, mmr, trench tier match; me without blink until :; our drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of pc problems, lina with aghanim and no meka; wards only for half match(i'm guilty of it too); we lost roshan two times, over kills of difference for the radiants, lina and storm spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul don't evel let me start on that one, and so on.at the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to ff gg wp ez qq ms ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between lina and storm, i asked myself some questions: am i having fun? is this game making me laugh? how many funny moments i can remember about this game? is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <kh scum nb)? the answers to the questions were: no, no, not even , i don't know. in that instant, i realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. how many times have i actually enjoyed what was going on screen? why am i taking this so seriously? why do i want to win so desperately? why do my teammates want to win so desperately?...how many times have i smiled while playing this game?...these are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! this makes me sad. i've heard yelling my whole life, i play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. games really help me, they help me a lot. please, guys, stop, dont get mad, im serious! this is a game, right? games are meant to be fun! please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, its not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! its just a videogame! enjoy the little things you can get out of it! remember dp dancing to death? wasn't that fun? remember pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? and then the radiants team wiped us? yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? sorta fun? even a little bit? yes we lost this match but cmon! don't hide in the fountain! lets do something silly to them! lets annoy them! storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain! lets watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you! isn't that fun?

4187,"okay for starters this is not yu-gi-oh. and with that being said, i both enjoy and loathe this game. also the pay wall doesn't personally bother me too much because i grew up playing card games.what you need to know: . twenty card decks rule the game, and these decks are usually loaded with the best traps and spells money can buy. so if you play this game pick a card box with the best spell and trap cards in it and keep using your free gems on those boxes until you have two or three copies of said cards. pro tip, reset set the box after you pull the cards you're going after.. you'll see the top meta decks so many times that you'll beg to see some originality... lol, you'll never escape this, even in unranked.. farm mai for amazonian cards because amazonian decks can be mostly built from card drops. amazonian decks are pretty powerful, even in ranked. you can also get solid plant/water cards from the card trader. (google this for more info). the game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyimao:. honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.. deck sizes should be increased to minimum. card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the fp ultra rare card discrepancy.. i could list more serious problems caused by konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things i hate the most about the game.in closing, if i see one more fully loaded blue eyes deck i'm going to vomit!",0

22241,something like this happened to me but with the guy looking for gavin. i started talking to him when i found him in the middle of nowhere to see if he had new dialogue. he started repeating the same thing he said last time i saw him so i got back on my horse and started galloping away. suddenly. he started yelling again but it was getting louder. i turned back around and he was running at the same speed as my horse through the trees and rocks to keep up next to me until he finished his spiel and finally started walking slowly again. it freaked me the fuck out. i have it saved on my xbox if i can find a way to upload it.,0

25938,"well, it's that way for life in general, isn't it?if people respect you, they'll treat you better. and then there will be a few people who you either need to work harder to earn their respect, or who will never give you respect because they're just toxic by nature (mean to those they see as below them, and jealous of those above them.. so mean to them as well. haters)in a game you earn respect in two ways: your attitude and your ability to play the game. one of these is more important than the other, but both help.unfortunately, women get less respect out of the gate from a large number of people. there are many reasons for this and i don't personally agree with any of them. but, again, respect can be earned (and lost) within the gaming communities based on attitude and skill. with many games, like cod and lol, the games are short enough and player base large enough, that you usually only have the course of that one game to earn respect.. and then you'll rarely see those players again, unless you're on the very top or the very bottom. (thanks matchmaking) once you're up top, the toxicity tends to fade away, because everybody gets to know the others and can acknowledge their skill.. at that point respect difference is almost directly related to attitude. if you're on the bottom.. well holy shit, i've seen some things on the bottom. literal cesspools. (my ex was hard stuck bronze v in lol.. what a nightmare). she received negative comments every game and it was a generally terrible experience for her. so, i jumped on her account and played games (- record.. i remember being proud about that for some reason) in order to drag her back up to silver. in my time playing her account, i received negative comments at the start of almost every game, and praise and excitement later in the game and in future lobbies from those same players.. because i was single-handedly carrying them.for the record: she used a typically male-assumed name (ichigo), while i used this name (often assumed female). the toxicity directed at her was worse and more frequent than at me *by a long shot*. she responded poorly to it, often raging in chat - something i typically don't do. this caused her to play worse, get flamed more, and it's really just a downward spiral at that point.all this said: skill is the primary factor toward respect levels. attitude is the secondary factor. and sex is probably the tertiary factor (though ability to spell/type well could possibly be above that, if we're honest)..very similar to life. if you're successful, people give you more respect. if you've got a good attitude, same thing but nowhere near as impactful. and if you're a woman or person of color (games usually don't have an indicator for this one), then you start at a lower base value. *and there will always be haters*",1

(not a problem with my network btw. it handles all other online games including bf flawlessly). i'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that i was just playing on a bad server). all in all, this is a really fun game. the sort of game i've been looking for a long time. it's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars. i'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it. i would definitely recommend it!",1
13811,"let me say that right now many reviews left for this game have been due to very little experience or express sheer negativity due to what's expected to be temporary issues during the shaky steam launch. as such, the opinion of many have only scratched the surface of what a gem this game is. i'm sure the server issues and other feedback received will be put into effect soon enough.with that out of the way, onto my perspective of the game; i've been a semi-veteran player of this game for a long time and i've seen the rise and fall of dreadnought phases prior to steam. i assure that when the game is out of the current funk, it is an absolute blast. i'll say now that dreadnought is graphically a rather appealing game; the explosions, particle effects, and general environment all feel well-designed. each class of ship is unique and all are worth playing. i would say that % of my games i've played have had people playing all roles by desire. the progression in dreadnought is slow and steady but it feels proper; early progression playing in the recruit fleets gets you a good feel for the game and you learn a lot of stuff from your experience here as you grind out your ships to get to the next tiers. most of your time and grind will be in the veteran fleet as this provides the most diverse and immediate gameplay. you're rewarded for trying new things and whether your win or lose, it's a fun time!i will say that the integration to steam came with a few flaws outside of the current server problems; a couple of troublesome bugs are still existent in the game though they are not necessarily gamebreaking. also, the new ui is cumbersome to navigate and some of the new sounds in the game are less than stellar. some sounds that sounded great before are questionable now, but also on the flipside, some sounds lackluster before are now much better!in conclusion; before you pass on this game due to the constant reviews talking about what is mostly temporary problems, consider spending a few hours trying the game out, especially after the servers settle. if commanding a spaceship to go into battle has been one of your desires, dreadnought will not disappoint!",1

4196,"i played this game a lot on my phone, so i can say that for yugioh fans, this game can be fun at times as long as you build your deck carefully. you get to play as a lot of characters from the anime, though some of them i question as they don't really fit the whole 'legendary dulist' catagoery. kinda like bandit keith... he's only been shown in a few episodes and frankly... he's kinda underwhelming at best. sure he uses machine type monsters, but he also cheats at times just to steal a victory. not really something a 'legendary dulist' would do. as for weevil underwood, while having a few interesting cards of his own you can play around with, he's also not much of a 'legendary dulist' as bug brain also cheated a few times. once by tossing all of yugi moto's exodia cards off a boat they were on, and for when he tried to fight against joey wheeler. i'm actually surprised that we don't get to play as tristan taylor in this game as he had the -headed dragon card as a boss monster and while some of his military themed cards weren't the best, he could be kinda fun to play around with. other characters you won't be able to play as in the game i can think of off the bat, chumley, syrus&zane trusedale, rubecca, tyranno hassleberry, atticus rhodes, and even if he was for an event, jesse anderson, and maybe just for fun, duke devlin.this is also a good chance for the makers of the card game to look over some of the old archtypes in the game and give them some much needed updates. like the neo spacians. we need to have nex be more usable with the chaarcters shown on the card as it only affects a few of them. it would also be nice if the normal battles we have with the npcs actually had some 'good' card rewards... as well as a list of cards we can look at when we battle them, it can also be said that we can use more characters to play as, even if some of them didn't do a whole lot in the anime or comics of which they are from. overall, the game can be fun at times, just don't spend too much of your money on it unless it's for the special sales they have every now and then. all that's needed to make it better, new cards for the old archtypes that haven't been touched in a long time like the neo spacians i mentioned before, or any other archtype that could really use some new cards to give them a much needed boost and relavance in competitive play as well as letting us in the game be able to use the banned cards outside of the pvp when dueling competitively as well as possible lifting the ban on some of the cards that don't really need a ban on them as the newer cards of today outside of this digital game... well... they can absolutely destroy some of the banned cards without much effort. take a look at gaurdians for a moment and you can tell right away that they need some help, as well as a certian spell card un-banned so that we can use the monster it's supposed to let us use in the first place. the same can be said for a few other archtypes as well, other than that. i suggest checking it out and hope that in time we'll be able to get some of the cards we really needed for the archtypes that caught our eyes, but didn't have the tools needed to be useful. on another note... whatever you do, don't use the auto duel function. the a.i. for when you're set to auto duel can and will make so many mistakes. it will fail to play certain cards that are in your hand that could of and would of given you a victory if it had just played them, or at the very least gave you some breathing room in your duel against your opponent. take any field spell card or magical mallet for example, you have a good monster out on your side of the field and your opponent has two monsters out, one of them being stronger than the other and yours unless you play the field spell, you have a field spell card in your hand that can help you out. the a.i. won't play it if you're in auto, instead it was attack whatever it can and end your turn, leaving you with a monster you could beaten if the a.i. was smart enough to play it first. another example for magical mallet, let's say you got a bad hand, but have the spell card magical mallet to shuffle it all in your deck and get new cards, if you're in auto duel, the a.i. won't play it and just end your turn, leaving you wide open for an attack that could very well lead to you losing before you even did anything.",1

15727,"trying to recommend this game is trying to tell me that i should kill my palico on monster hunter world: it's impossible.many of artix entertainment's adventures into lore have been interesting, from the ever-nostalgic adventurequest, to the dragon-infested dragonfable, to a lore where every kid who can't pvp uses void highlord on adventurequest worlds. now we have the most linear and most boring of these lore adaptations, not to mention the most toxic of communities.i started playing, got the name chronicle, got the chronomancer set, and i was happy not spending any money on the game. reached the graveyard where everyone else was struggling, and regardless of the many people that are in the area, nobody was interested in helping each other. i do admire, to a full extent, of ae's intention to pull away from the ease of doing everything yourself, to relying constantly on teamwork to push through. while this would normally work, it doesn't when everyone you meet is a constant jerk. even some of the most recognisable faces in aqd would rather brag about what items they have over helping the newer players who haven't a clue. it's become so biased and it's hasn't had a long full release yet.let's not mention a lie that has doomed the game from the very start. it had been started that as we have always said, micro-currency will never pay-to-win power but will be used to (among other things) save time, which was intended for the crafting system, but the rest of the game is reliant on being as rich as a guy with a burning flames team captain on tf just to catch up from level without missing out. the kickstarter rewards, not to mention, are nonsensical. instead of physical items that can be souvenirs from a time where you provided monetary assistance to get the game out, you're instead treated to virtual items that may/may not provide a headstart to a game that was meant to be free of the pw stigma. instead, they've since welcomed it. it's the typical steam mmo we hoped it wouldn't be.it's such a shame. as artix von krieger's friend and fan, i'm utterly disappointed with how aqd turned out. sad to say, there's no way to fix it.",0

16331,"at first this seemed really cool... before i downloaded it. then after spending an hour or so i found it to be a total drm p.o.s.. i mean, you have to frigg'n be online just to play this thing... wth?every time you want o play/ disassemble/assemble a gun, the game has to redownload the model... why?? suppose you live where the internet conenction is bad, or your camping and want to goof off after a long days hike on your laptop. nooo...even the shooting ranges are limited, cause it's only for one kind fo gun. you can pick the kindof shooting range you want, choose whatever gun you want and start popping off shots. no. it's whatever they want to give you, and only a small fraction of guns get to be used in the shooting range.the game is constanly telling you how much more exp you could have earned by buying a booster pack, and even forking out $ doesn't unlock every item (good thing i only got the free version.)disassembly is dumbed down too. oh sure, some models require you to remove every screw, but, only for that region. even then most guns assemble+disassemble as an assembly, meaning a group of parts com apart at the simple click of a button. i really don't feel like you learn much.textures range from realisic, to flat out lazy. the ak and are very pretty, but guns like the tech sport few convincing textures (especially the barrel assembly.) the game goes so far as to tell you can unlock any gun at any time... if you pay money...while the multiple x-ray modes, attchments are cool, there's really nothing redeeming about this at all. if i were to actually get a copy that didn't require the internet to even use and still required money to buy, i'd might consider it. but inthe end, it's really a modern-day corrupt app. and i don't are if the devs say: well, we want to preven piracy. to heck with that noise, this exact philosophy is what made sooo many gamers ticked off about the original features of the x-box . so... why bother with games like that at all. i don't care if this is more of a simulator than a game, i care about integrity, and i find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practices.--- real gamers don't need their wallets to unlock features. nay sayers can go suck a lemon.",0
11338,its a good game i have been playing it for a long time its a lot of fun i adore this game except all the boxes am opening i aint gettinglol xd all of my skins are,1
16397,when i first got the game i was a little skeptical but after about ten minutes i was impressed with it's realism and accuracy. i'm kinda a firearm fenatic and this game is a great learning application as well as a fun addicting game. it seems as if it would be a great tablet game but so do some of the graphics during the target shooting. but over all the educational aspect over weighs this for me. all in all i would totally recomend this game for anyone who want's a challange and addicting gun simulator.,1

6309,"product received for freeearly access reviewthis game, has potential. this can be a fun game. and i hope, that this game is fun when it is finished. but, the beta lacks balance. in the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. that is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. some may say,oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon. i would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. the first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. to hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then. i haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. most of the maps, i've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. only five to be exact. however, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective. the lack of progress is irratating. because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. after about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. you then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. plus, the first american smg is significantly better than the german counterpart because of its lack of recoil. after almost twelve hours pf gameplay, i still can't afford the smg, i'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and i'm frankly at wits end. i will say that at first it was fun, but now i find myself getting annoyed. i am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like i haven't made any progress. i think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. if you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. but their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.",0

14812,"came back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that i no longer endorse this game. they had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (tl;dr alert) i've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why i don't play anymore. i used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. the removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. all of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. shooting said weak spots and watching % of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. it was the highlight of the game. the second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.how did this change? the removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. this absolutely destroyed the enjoyment of the game for me. i regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below % health, and this was due to having working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. the poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy % of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. it used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. i got destroyed all the time when i first started playing, but i did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about kills per game (no respawns when i played)i honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but i hate when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche. rip robocraft.",0

1079,ok so i saw this game for fee on the store for the weekend so got it under the asumption of well cost me nothing so worth a try. i am recomending this game however there are some bad points which i am going to get out of the way first. when first loaded i did have some major bugs one crashed my pc completely and another was if i tabed out i could not get back on without restarting the game both seem to have fixed on their own. another problem is limited content and microtransactions the bane of a gamers existance however its mostly to speed up getting ships or getting skins and there is more content on the way hopefully a few more maps as well as a new gamemode. i have just played over hours in the last two days some with a friend some alone and have now come to the end of the exitement phase and the next ships i want are hours of gameplay or real money away so will not be playing all the time next week but will pop on for a match or so as it is very fun.now onto the good stuff..the combat is simple and entuative but rewarding flying a massive capital ship into battle is awsome.the ships are amazing they look good and they do play differently so you can play a variety of roles as well as the starter ships being competative so you can get on fine from you first game.playing with a friend you can comunicate with makes you far more combat effective and more enjoyable would be nice to have the option of being a team of but that may be unfair.finally the value if you can get it on the free weekend just do its free fun if not its not overly expensive and it works not like half the alpha junk you find on here begging for full price for nothing. suffers from a few alpha problems but fun and plays well.have fun guys.,1

14556,"if we were back in time around -, i would recommend this game. now, it deserves to be un-recommended. as you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. i only started playing around mid- and personally, i thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. i got the majority of my hours of playtime in the first year since i got it. now, the game has just gone downhill. freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the random loot crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. before, you couldn't win a battle arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. now, there can be one or two enormous mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. their recent update with the random loot crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. also, what they call the best player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best k:d ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. this increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates. from the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a premium account for the game. in conclusion: robocraft was awesome. because freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not premium. now, robocraft is horrible. because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. this game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.---update: after months on end of ignoring the game, i forced myself to boot it up one more time just so i can see what's new and how the community has changed. now i would like to declare that robocraft has officially died. it's just not what it was before. everything is different, in a bad way. this is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money. rip robocraft!!---",0

3506,"people have been referring to this game as the free, and better, pubg. could this be true? is it worth your precious mins of download? let's see... core gameplay it's...a battle royale game. i didn't expect much from it as i felt it was trying to copy other games just for that sweet popularity. i'm pretty impressed about how this game actually performed.you start off with a view of a map. you pick where you spawn, and you can see where others spawn. you have classes, glider (you can jump and glide from high places) snow boarder (you can snow board fast down hills) and climber (you can climb mountains and use the various zip lines placed throughout the map.there are an...okay variety of guns. it's not a lot, but it's pretty decent. i've encountered like different guns. the loot spawns in predictable places, i think they're set to spawn there every time. details the graphics are okay. i mean, there are particles of snow that pop up when you drive/run, and you can leave footsteps in a certain density of snow. different textures have different sounds, and i'm shocked as of how realistic they sound.the gunfire has realistic recoil, and the guns are pretty detailed.the textures have settings, low, medium, and standard. none of these really make a difference, however. optimization sadlly, this game is poorly optimized. the game stutters a lot and i encounter frame drops and rubber banding, even with an i and ti and set to lowest settings. the game's minimum requirements are just basically what you must have to get to the main menu. overall well, the review can be summarized short and simple. the game is free, however it really exceeded my expectations for a free game. i can't really complain about the little things, the only real problem i have with this free game is it's poor optimization.is it worth your time to download and play? i mean...yea. it's pretty fun, and it pretty much is the free, better pubg.",1
15464,"yes, hours have been spent on this game with recurring problems - the prevalent one being graphics not loading completely upon every start of the game client.this problem has persisted since the beginning and gets worse as more crusaders are added. without graphics you will likely be unable to deploy crusaders or change formation by pulling benched crusaders.given that this problem still persists, i would not recommend this game to players outside of north america as that is where their servers hosting the game's assets are located. if you are geographically far from said region then you may experience inconsistent loading of the game's numerous graphics resulting in a frustrating, and close to unplayable game.** edit - jun **the developers discreetly pushed an update and a lot of graphical assets were added to the local directory being used by the steam version of the game client.it seems to have greatly helped in sorting out the missing graphics. at the moment, no official update has been released regarding this so it is still possible that more long-term fixes may be further down the line.",1

3801,"i made my steam account specifically for tf back in the day, and there was a long time i'd just play this game for hours every day of the week. i loved tf to death, i can still remember how happy i was when i first found a hat or when i uncrated something good. the best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. it seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. it was great.those days are completely gone though. this year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. i feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. the last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. the war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. what about the new content for pyro? pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. team fortress just feels dead. in the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much i hadn't even tried yet. now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.i have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone i know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. i know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. i know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. step up your game.",0

10769,"pros:+ the few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ similar to magic the gatheringcons:- most games go into top deck mode- mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- legendaries are very expensive- stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed: think this is very misguided. ccgs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. take league of legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. as far as i am concerned, every match where i'm mana screwed is the same. i have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.since the playerbase is comprised of mostly magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.another praise i often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why i became interested in the first place. again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.verdict:overall, eternal is a near exact copy of magic. to me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. however, i cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from magic.",0

4018,"meet your match is a mess of an update, but i believe that tf will pull through, like time and time before, again.many balances have been for the better, and for the not as well thought out ones, underlying them lies a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward.to all the minor class and weapon rebalances,i appreciated spy and pyro buffs, valve recognized that pyro and spy were underpowered.a health buff for pyro () instead of or in addition to its dps buff would be better suited to its current role in tf i believe however.natascha and huo long were nerfed and buffed nicely.sun on a stick might actually see some use now (maybe).other good rebalances include widowmaker, short circuit, disciplinary action, eureka effect, overdose (as a medic main, i get and like what valve is trying to do here).the point i'm trying to make, is that from all the rebalances, one can see that valve really is taking the time to understand how this game is played.with that in mind, here are some of the major problems i see and how valve can fix them.casual: it's a good idea, the only problem being it is no longer casual.you cant join friends in the middle of a game anymore.and the servers they assign you to have terrible pings where i am.all the good players who like to mess around stopped playing and all the terrible players started tryharding.an easy way to fix this is bringing back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by looking through server list or the join game button and voting systems to extend current map/match-up.comp: should be available for all players who have played above a certain amount of hours instead of just for those who paid for the game.if one or two hour farmers get through it wont matter because valve could easily use their ranking system to pair people with similar skill levels together. if you arent good, doesnt matter how much you game the system, you're stuck at bottom.comp needs class limits.maybe for each assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as to keep the game dynamic.(read up on the metagame and watch some matches before you ask why)medic speed buff is stupid. increases survivability of medic, encouraging stalemates in comp (medics feel safer, less urgency to push from winning team).reduces the fun in playing medic because you get to be sloppier in your positioning, less good at dodging which is basically all medic is about.scout did -not- need another buff (or whatever this was to scout)it sounds like it makes sense travel at the same rate of the player you are healing but it's actually really gimmicky, basically boiling down to heal scouts to go fast because they are only class faster than medic.despite the above, potential players, dont be put off. tf is still a miracle of a game: the chemistry between all the classes work so well, it is incredibly fun to play and getting good is really satisfying.besides, there's always community servers to tide this over (cp_orange, jump maps, mge, / dustbowl hightower)",1

7939,this game used to be amazing i played most of my time on xbox one and i still think its a brilliant game but my review is based on how it is now and not the fun ive had in the past.effectivly all the content before you hit a platau is to get you hooked in the story is pretty unimaganitive its all about better loot as are all mmos really. once you cap you have weeklys and dungeons/the real campaign but to really get anywhere in this game its hugly pay to win. want a decent mount above % speed how about pound minimum spend...how about a new decent companion? yep pound minimum spend. expansion for the game how about pound and theres a few. i bought the dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other things and realised even then i was nowhere i end up spending pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expected me to pay - pounds. the game is infact verryyy expencive and it tries to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i cant go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune. you cant even make that much in game money that yes is transferable to real money to buy stuff but untill you have spent to much the more you spend the more you make.very pay to play if you want a game you can keep playing without having to spend more and more money then id not recomend this game at all.as my old mate admiral ackbar said its a trap!,0

8877,"planetside is one of the toughest games to review. the sci-fi theme is rooted in a lot of s media and aesthetically superior to most futuristic fps games, held down only by fp items and inconsistent faction variation. the gameplay is reminiscent of older battlefield games, just on a much superior scale. outside of that franchise, there's so little competition that planetisde stands out even with many glaring flaws. providing a slow burn with teamwork and co-ordination valued above any silly k/d stat, perpetual war means little downtime, and hours can be soaked up. i wouldn't really call it immersive but as platoons are large enough to consist of combined arms fronts one can take position in all aspects of the war experience. the four main continents upon each addition started dividing up the player base , so they eventually (finally) added continent capping to keep it to only two continents, one with actual battles and the other with ghost capping squads. additional server mergers helped mitigate a loss in playerbase and server biases towards certain factions. this is the only fp game to my memory i directly spent money on so for all i can say, the cosmetics are overpriced. back in -, they ran a month long sale in december where their chosen cosmetic or weapon was dirt cheap. i would say without any doubt the game was not pw, but so much has been added since i stopped playing actively in . the new implant system is both limited and potentially too rewarding for those that luck out in rng, but less annoying than the old limiting system. additional disappointments include an overall graphical downgrade (old high is new ultra), questionable content upgrades, and a dev team that's missing the real spark the og team had. i enjoy the larger facilities but fights seem increasingly focused around fun points instead of them, with a huge lack of major facilities, cities or fortresses.indar stands out as the best map, with iconic points, three unique biomes and objectively the best vehicle and infantry fights. gun play is wishy-washy, some providing a satisfying dink, others feel floaty. medic and engineer provide mmo grinds for xp if the forces killing you in battles seem too external. sadly, this game is dying and i don't believe market trends or daybreak games can save it. issues preventing this from running on toasters already hurts much of the potential fp market. all in all, few games have the true wow factor or give me a desire to learn everything as does this game. remember to live free in the nc, and bring many friends or find them quickly, as only a few grunts won't provide a major difference against a trained platoon.***endnote***there's no way in hell this game is pay win for any combat purchases. if you're whining about having a terrible k/d there's no reason why the carv, saw or orion can't carry you. git gud or shut up. my k/d shot up after making sure it was only using raw input on my mouse, turning off smoothing/vsync and lowering my sensitivity to a fraction of the default.",1

2121,"of exile: an action rpg similar to style and feel of great titles like diablo . path of exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other arpgs. from the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of wraeclast itself, its a unique enough experience that i havent encountered anything quite like path of exile before. its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of arpgs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement. the game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. the story and lore of wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most arpgs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. the game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other arpgs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. overall the experience of path of exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. personally, i would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. as a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully i can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these wont feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. path of exile is a great arpg, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers + of content for a first time through the entire game and its all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -double thumbs up from royialvideo reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/royialnetwork",1

7130,"// - . hrs last two weeks / . hrs on recordi found this while meandering around steam looking for new/different stuff to play.i've played hearthstone and magic: the gathering. i quit both because i did not get enough fun proportionate to the cost.this game shares the resource pool mechanics with hearthstone and the artistic beauty of magic: the gathering. it doesn't look as expensive as either of them. given the game is in its infancy, it makes sense that there are no special formats based on the release date or release set of the cards. the rune mechanic strongly influences the metagame and sets the elder scrolls: legends apart from its spiritual parent, hearthstone.deck building is based on a maximum of two of the five attributes plus a neutral pool, which might as well be called colors by mtg standards or classes by hs standards. i see this aspect as a direct upgrade from hs's system, even though (and perhaps especially because) tesl offers no class abilities. this also removes the pigeon-hole effect from class-only cards by essentially allowing you to dual-class. i think class abilities make the game less about the cards themselves. in a card game, i hope the game retains an undiluted focus on the cards.the intro story mode was riveting with its special game modes and meaning-lite choices, and helpful as a tutorial. i look forward to the opportunity to explore the current dark brotherhood segments and future story chapters, with the in-game currency.it's a card game. no matter how competitive or wise you may be, there are randomized elements that are both the intrigue and ultimately the achilles' heel of the game. luck may have it that you win some and you lose some, or that you win many and you lose few, or that you win few and you lose many. winning feels good (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when i could be faced with opponents of wildly varying skill levels and deck strengths. losing feels bad (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when both players in a match are subject to draw both useful-at-the-time and not-so-useful-right-now cards. winning or losing too easily feels unearned, and while the rune mechanic alleviates some of that problem, it also introduces some right back.i will hold onto my wallet for now. i've taken a look at some of the starter and one-time-purchase (?) packs available, and i could easily see myself spending $. i've spent much, much more than that on magic, but i'm not here to spend money; i'm here to entertain and validate myself in a competitive environment. i believe many of us are.whether or not you've played other card games, i recommend giving this one a try. just remember that it's a card game, and like real life, there are aspects of it that are out of your direct control. never feel too good, or too bad, about the outcome of a match; just play the game, and if you aren't entertained, find something else to do. i write this for myself.~~~follow up update //~~~it's incredibly easy to burn out on this game. might as well just show up for the daily quests and then leave, since the rest is heavily based on luck for a newer player without enough full sets of cards to make a more reliable deck.it was quite fun for the first day or two. it really was. now there's nothing left but a bucket with a dollar sign on it. it really isn't worth my time to grind for gold/exp/gems, because it will never be enough and it will always take too long.my next review will be in one year after i've accumulated the * gold that should yield. maybe then there will be a game for me to play. yes, it's a free to play game. i don't much like disappointment, though, no matter how much it cost.i can't recommend the game in its current form.",0

15666,"as it says, this is an early access review. in other words, the game will improve over time. if you don't wish to play the game when it's incomplete, you aren't suitable for beta testing or any testing for that matter. stay away from this currently incomplete game. (you have been warned).just like every other ae game, this has the same concept. farming. it's extremely grindy, like seriously. if you hate any form of grinding or too much grinding, then stay away as well.there are new features such as crafting and now even the pumpkin lord armour is farmable. which is a great step forward for non-pp players. in other words, it is more farmy and less cashy. just like how an ae game should be.for anyone that complained that the pumpkinlord armour is too hard to farm due to low levels joining in the dungeon, they have capped it and is now much more easy.a new area has been released and guess what? more farming! before anyone starts complaining that the hard area is too hard, it's probably because you're too low level. (basically a newbie. not an insult here.)i take back my previous statement about levels being less important though. they are super important because the best armour currently available in game is level .if you're new to ae games, i really don't recommend this because the story does not flow. yes. ae games are made in such a way that if you never played any other games made by them, the story will feel very weird and rushed. as a long time player of all their games, i can say that their lore is extremely deep. for example, the plot twist about artix and gravelyn actually makes sense. if you looked back at their past storyline, you'll actually see why. sepulchure's backstory is personally my favourite (and the way he died t^t)basically, if you want to start on this game, play all of its prequels.if you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how ae games work, you will have a % chance of either loving it, or hating it.",1

4814,"this was once one of, if not, my favorite games. the base concept of the game is amazing. it is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. the problem lies within the developer, hirez (or titanforge whatever they are called now).if i had to give this game a rating on just the base game and how fun it is, i'd give it a ./yes, i still play very frequently. but it's only ever with my friends and never alone. i have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but i don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. i've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. i've simply learned too many things and played so much that i would say that i am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.the matchmaking is just a joke. honestly. i don't need to say more than that. matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get yourpushed in.there are very frequent patches, one or two a month. a new god is also released everyone .-ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. the problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for litearlly years. yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since and was fixed only recently. years! and even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in seconds or something like that.the skins in this game are amazing to be fair. they look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. there's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire year.again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. certain gamemodes like siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. the game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.it's also frustrating that this year hirez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on mixer instead of twitch. this is when i realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on mixer than there would be on twitch. not to mention that the smite world championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to smite through twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.i think i have put more time into this game than any other game i have ever played. i love this game, but i cannot stress how terrible it feels to play it. i enjoy it far less and sometimes i'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. i feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. i have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest. the problem is that i am in the majority.overall, i just couldn't reccommend this game to anyone in the current state that it is in. i have k+ hours on steam alone but i played before it was even on steam. i love this game so much, but hirez is not a good company for smite. they don't know what they are doing.thanks for reading my rant lmao",0

2762,"to start, i should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. when the community is good, it's great! i've formed many lasting friendships, and i'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i met through the game.but war thunder has a problem with women. not all players are like that--not even the majority. but enough s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls i know, and we as a community can do better.i'm a woman. i like to play comp, and i get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. for the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy j somehow gets me every push.) but there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if i'll send nudes, or if i'll perform an obscene act for you. (even if you're joking, it's really not funny, i promise.) it's grating to be continually asked if i'm a bomber main since i'm a girl, or for you to demand that i pocket you. (i don't play bomber. sorry. how about naval planes?)it's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them trolling me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and aand much, much worse. i've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. when playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.and despite all this, i still get on mic and speak. partly because i'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. time and time again, i've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. they say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. people say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.i know most of you are decent people. i'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. but we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. more than just reporting it when you see it (although i wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. even a simple hey man, that's not cool can both () let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and () let the harassee know that decent people do exist. the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.so please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!eta: thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, i appreciate it! it means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. like i said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.a couple people have said things akin to this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc. i'm well aware of how the internet can be, and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. it's not me i'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as i am who really suffer. just because i'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.people have also said things akin to if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating. aside from putting the blame on me (which i think is unfair), i don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. it's not like i announce to everyone hey guys, this is my girlfriend! we are dating! (although i really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). what generally happens is one of us will refer to other as babe during a game (e.g., nice pilot knockout, babe), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.also, every person who responded to this post with shut up bomber just proved my point. i know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit.",0

(or, y'know, an almost-fully-lit-up cave, keyword almost)crafting:pros:it's cute and simple.take a thing, shove it into a machine and it cuts it up, or cooks it up, and then you come back later and pick up your finished thing.cons:extremely gamey recipies. a level diamond digging glove takes diamonds (ok!), pristine feral pig skins (???), ice cubes (???) and some other stuff. why? because those are all tier materials! many other items have similarly stupid and pointless reagents needed, for gamey reasons!too much stuff, too little inventory to manage it all.exploration:pros:the built-in map is a nice touch.teleporters are easy enough to make, and there is a player waypoint touchstone which you are given for free, that functions essentially as a spawn point and teleport locale.caves are large and vast. it was not often that i explored a cave in it's entirety.cons:not much to explore? the surface had perhaps or biomes total. grassland, forest, canyon, snow, and... maybe one another? maybe there were more, i don't know, i never found them. i explored quite a bit on the surface for a good or hours, and i just found these same repeating over and over.the caves weren't much better, since it was entirely % layer-based. between and -? surface caves.- to -? stalactite caves.- to -? lava caves.- to -? corrupted caves. yawn.no structures, no nothing worth your time, unless you like looking at large and empty caves full of infinitely spawning monsters.- misc:multiplayer was easy enough to do. i just started a world, and a friend joined me right away.physics are kinda jenky. sometimes monsters would 'pop' really high into the air and then fall down. sometimes **i** would fly into the air when placing a block, killing me.not really a fault, but i felt like the cash shop was too in-your-face too early. before i had even gotten in-game the very first time, i was bombarded by the cash shop suggesting i buy stuff. maybe hold off on that stuff till the nd launch, maybe?overall, it was not that fun of a game, but at it's current price of free, it was worth the cost.",1

5963,"if you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game. like others have mentioned , the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying , it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying. but then the experience is really rewarding. if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process. now in my book there are types of fans when it comes to flying games . lets see ...- the first type only want to grab the stick (or keyboard) and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else. if you are from this type then go for battlefield series , hawx or war thunder..etc. don't bother with dcs . you will have hours of fun with the other titles that i mentioned. and trust me , there are some really good ones out there and i've personally tried most of them . - this type of fans love flying and don't mind getting into some details about planes but they don't want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details. if you belong in this category , look up flaming cliffs on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading. - these are plane nerds. they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane. they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so. if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading ? go download dcs and have fun . thank me later. now ... if you are the first type ... don't bother with dcs. there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun. dcs is for the other types . if you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. dcs has non-clickable cockpits in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. but here is the thing. you can by fc and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for dcs you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but keep reading .finally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where you actually need to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because dcs not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to fsx or fg and see the difference. as a final note , some say the planes are expensive. i believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the dcs' website. usually you can by all planes for % off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . i say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with dcs:fc . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.",1

11201,"well, in short, the game is pretty meh, it has some cool ideas, but messes it up by not having good fundamentals. they increased the variance (which was already the main drawback of games like magic the gathering) to such an extent that most games are simply decided by rng/topdecking. some cards are also kinda like that, that they can win the game in a turn, if the opponent doesn't have the exact right answer at that one turn. being mana flooded for a few turns is pretty common (it's almost impossible to avoid with a decksize of ! statistically speaking)so, yeah, all these factors lead me to believe that the creaters fundamentally don't understand the basic mechanics (and more importantly mathematics) of card games or they jsut wanted to make an ultra casual mtg clone (which is hard, since mtg is alredy pretty casual in some ways)",0

4109,"i know a lot of people don't like these types of games that show up because mobile games belong on mobile, however i would like to try to convince you guys that this one is an exception. i played several months of the mobile version of this game and hope to at least make those of you on the fence curious enough to give it a shot. yu-gi-oh! is a pretty reknown franchise that struck most of us as kids, some younger some older. for me, i was about years old, getting ready for a cheerleading performance (i do not miss being a cheerleader -_-), and i had enough time to watch the premiere episode of yu-gi-oh! on tv. i've enjoyed the series and games ever since, although some of the more complicated types of cards disappoint me slightly *coughpendelumscough*.yu-gi-oh! duel links is effectively taking the mobile games generations and bam! and combining certain attributes to get a surprisingly entertaining hit from konami for the first time in a while (outside of console games). effectively cutting the base yu-gi-oh! game in half, by limiting the field of monsters and spell/trap zones to , deck sizes from - to - and everyone starts with less cards, save that you start second as per the new rulings. beyond that and a limitation of certain cards that made the original game a fixed meta, and you have a surprising hit with some special cameos from well known characters that plays out as the original would otherwise.play as your favorite characters as you want. i was sold by my ability to play as and start as seto kaiba himself. some may prefer yami yugi, or mako, or mai or joey, or hell even friggen bandit keith. (in america!). and with the recent release of the ever so popular yu-gi-oh! gx series characters, cards and map, you have more options to play, and for the most part, next to no limitations in which cards you want to use for which characters.now to the imporant questions like, what about ban lists? yes, konami is in the process of adding a ban list for certain cards, now that there's a large pool for players to work with. however, it was literally patched in a few weeks ago and may take time for them to adjust to the current meta. what about *insert archtype*? - they get added in usually when a character known to use said archtype appears in the game. most recently they had jesse anderson running around with obtainable crystal beast cards. your favorite archtype is likely already there, if not, on the way.is there a strong deck type right now? - yep, the common ones i see a lot are blue-eyes white dragon decks using seto kaiba, warrior decks using joey wheeler, fire kings uses by whoever you think would utilize them the most. i personally have been using chazz prinston's ojama deck, recently with flying success, followed by using yugi moto for geminis.are there any major problems with the game that existed before the port? - sadly, yes. thankfully it's the only known problem to mention, and you guessed it. spam bots in the chat. konami recently updated their tos that made me think that they might be considering a stronger action against these illegal spam bot promoters, but i've yet to see any action yet. however, removing bots from a game or any other platform can be an uphill battle, especially if they've been there for a while.are there any issues with the steam version of this game? - no bugs that i know of. konami seems to be frequently keeping an eye on the game's status and bugs and is active to update and fix them. i personally wish they would allow for me to fix the screen resolution. i'm currently using a x resolution, but the game screen is slighly larger then that with no option to resize or anything.i was playing on the mobile version prior as well, but i don't wan to start a new game. can i sync my data? - yep, just click data transfer on the start screen, and make sure you have a konami account from the website that the game redirects you to. i've already synced mine and it works really well.is it pay-to-win? depends on how you see it. the game uses a premium currency of gems as a means to buy cards. however said gems can be earned pretty reliably by just playing the game. paying for things like duel orbs isn't even necessary in my opinion, or extra decks slots. the card packages that can be bought for real money however, is up for debate, because while they offer the same cards you would get for playing the game normally, they can be obtained faster by buying them, and there's certain package deals that reward you gems and sometimes an sr card certainty for buying them. i personally don't think it is pay-to-win because you can earn all the same cards that everyone else can, some effort and time required for event-only cards. not everyone feels the way i do though, and it's understandable.if you guys have any other questions and concerns regarding the game, feel free to ask, and please be sure to give this game a fair shot, it's worth the time. promise :",1

7261,"played this game long before it came on steam.if you are fed up with hearthstones limitations and money grabbing then you won't find a better alternative in elder scrolls, for that you willl need to look at spellweaver.the same goes for gameplay, they tried to be different with lanes, but they forgot everything else. what makes a card game great is gameplay and the ability to enjoy it in a balanced environment. elder scrolls does not offer this at all. in fact it is the same old crap, where players who have played more or payed will have the advantages. leaving you with a terribly unsatisfying choice of buying your way through or leaving the game or painfully grinding as fodder for other players who paid.at least in spellweaver you can grind cards vs the ai to get your collection up before facing people, in elder scrolls, this is not an option. so you will be faced with the decision to either get smashed vs people or pay.the free campaign offered a really nice introduction into the game and if only the momemtum could have continued from there. but it didn't, the fun abruptly ends when the campaign ends, and you realize the pay wall between you being able to continue to play more campaign or becoming competitive. the alternative is playing the ai for no relevant collection reward or doing the solo arenas that increase in difficulty without an equally scaling of draft choice strength.the game desperately wants you to pay money, that is the sad part, it just isn't worth it. unless you somehow fall in love with the gameplay, but in my opinion there isn't enough in this game to differentiate it from other card games. so because of this, would rather enjoy another card game like spellweaver that actually has many more advantages to this or other card games. would recommend you play that instead. if you really want to play a solid card game. go with spellweaver.",0

3081,"tl:dr; great game being tarnished by bad development practices (fpe/parts debacle as of late is a good example of it)to start, this game is fantastic. currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat, and ships/helicopters entering closed beta testing. no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone (arcade for 'casuals' and realistic battles for more 'hardcore' players)engine is utterly fantastic for any game, moreso a fp game. absolutely amazing performance on any system, can almost run on your microwave, while having great graphics on the highest settings. only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the config file but it's pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally isn't neccesary. i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is, in my opinion, one of the best fp games on the market. but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others, even if i continue to play the game.why? because gaijinthey have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up, and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them. outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle, such as the ru-. they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with ge purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it. special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection (fp), which parts are needed to repair your tank after it's damaged (which happens alot) and fp is needed to put out fires. these parts can each take - battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock.for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome. a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for gameplay and grinding were mentioned, and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind. this video then, unsurprisingly, received ~k downvotes versus ~k upvotes. comment section filled with people calling out gaijin and saying parts/fp should be free and not ground out for.then anywhere it removing the grind for parts/fp on a gaijin operated platform the discussion is censored. this parts/fp isn't the first nor last time gaijin perform a practice like this. i can not recommend people who haven't played this game to do so, you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into gameplay hampered by greedy practicesif gaijin ever turn this around, starting by somehow reducing/removing the parts/fp grind then i will change the reccomendation to a yes",0
7980,"to be honest, i don't really care for mmos; i tried to give this one a chance and it just confirmed my bias, but that just means that the genre isn't for me, and that's fine. therefor, i can't really judge how good neverwinter is as an mmo, i hardly played it, and me not liking it all that much isn't the reason why i give it the thumbs down.the reason is that when i tried to uninstall it via steam (since the game's own client doesn't appear to offer such an option), steam only uninstalled the mb client and left the + gb game folder untouched, blocking space on my harddisk. of course, i could just manually delete the folder, but that wouldn't restore any registry entries the client or game might have made. i couldn't find any solutions online, neither on the steam forums, nor elsewhere, people who adressed this same problem never got a helpful answer anywhere. so i wrote a detailed support ticket to perfect world entertainment explaining this issue, and they just gave me a copy-paste answer to fully deinstall a steam game, please deinstall it via your steam library, ignoring that this is precisely what i had done, and also everything else i had written.tl:dr so my advice is this: if you're planning on checking this game out (and who knows, maybe you will come to love it), don't do it via steam. use the arc installer instead, so you won't run into the same troubles i did.",0

8984,"ps is a great game, and i highly recommend it, if you've got a strong enough pc to play it smoothly. been playing on and off for the past couple of years, not on steam (i had hours in on the miller european server before i switched to the u.s. west coast server, for a grand total of as of this writing).a big thing for me is that the player base tends to be considerably more decent than that of a lot of other competitive shooter-type mmos i've played. and dbg seems to be really on top of hackers and cheaters lately. they tend to announce in-game when they've booted a cheater; i recently saw a broadcast message to all players a few sessions ago that ding dang dong has been bing bang banned for cheating. i guess the guy's name was that, or something like that, and the admin online was feeling frisky. got a kick out of that. anyway.but, of course, the real kick of the game is the massive battles involving - players, with bombers and fighters sparring overhead as the tanks and sundies (troop transports/mobile spawn points) roll across the battlefield amid the blips of players on foot. it really accomplishes something there, and the feel is great.as with any free-to-play game, progression is painfully slow if you don't spend *some* money on the game to get a few important goodies, like a heavy pistol, anti-aircraft guns for your max and light tank, and some heavier weaponry for your heavy tank, but the beginning weapons are noted as being competitive. in all honesty, i really don't know if i'd continue to enjoy the game nearly as much if i'd never spent a cent on it (and i've been pretty cheap -- we're on a tight budget, so i've spent $ total on it), but i suppose it's a matter of patience.i can say, though, that if you can, the game is worth the money you'll spend on it.unless you're on a core duo or something. in that case, just... no. you're going to be very frustrated with this. i am not sure -- i think they have optimized it better, but it is still very heavy-feeling, at least on our gb core duo clunker.those caveats aside, it's a great game, and i highly recommend it.",1

11235,"don't waste your time on this game, go play hex. hex doesn't have the resource screw or starving like here, and they have really good resource cards to where there are no problems. there you can have card decks. they don't limit you to how many troops you can have on the field. they have an auction house where you can buy and sell cards. if you really enjoy solo play, hex has a very large campaign and you can have a party of characters each with their own decks and there are dungeons that you take them through and you can select which character/deck you want to use for each fight inside. and they have an arena that you face ai opponents, but the arena really tests your skills.this game only has the gauntlet and that's mainly for new players to get some cards but their belief is that the money is in pvp so they discourage solo play in the gautlet by increasing the difficulty after each win to the point you can't win anymore. so if you want to keep playing you are forced into pvp formats. the hex community is friendly and helpful. here, everyone is alwaysabout the resource screw and the other things that there is a lot of negativity.don't invest your time or money here. it's fun at first but you will end up hating this game.",0

3946,"woo boy, this is gonna be a fun review. tldr at the end.this is a good game. it really is. there's so much i want to say about it, so i'll get started.graphically, this game is amazing. not because it's hyper-realistic, but because the art-style is unique to a point where it's almost impossible for it to look aged. this game is ten years old and still looks great. gameplay-wise, it's fun. you run around, you shoot people on the opposite team. it's not always shooting bullets though. there are classes, each with their own unique weapons. there are rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers. there are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well. even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use. the different classes are played in a variety of different ways, so there's probably a favorite class for everyone. and then there's character design. i could probably gush about this for hours, but i won't. each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette. they are all very unique, to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears. then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme. the scout's main weapons are all scatterguns, the heavy's main weapons are all miniguns, etc. these characters not only have unique designs, but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too. just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities. it's so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality, and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free. the characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous, but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable. there is probably something to be said about diversity here, especially because of its competitor, overwatch. there's no dancing around it; this game is simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as overwatch is. however, the characters presented in this game have far more personality than the characters presented in overwatch. i have played overwatch before, and unlike this game, was not enthralled by the characters. with this game, i was almost immediately drawn in because of the characters themselves, not just the gameplay. sadly, however, women designs were once upon a time made for this game, but for whatever reason were scrapped. they were very unique designs too, and if the team actually had followed through on making them and had applied the same effort they did for their male characters, they would have made some of the best dang female characters in gaming.i'm gonna apologize about the overwatch comparison, but i'm still salty about blizzard making half-baked female characters and then being touted as progressive when they're really just playing the middle to attract the most players. the tf character designers could make women characters that would crush overwatch in every way, if they ever decided to do that.there is also something to be said about the community. it sucks. big time. if you're a woman or have a high pitched voice, you're probably better off not using the voice chat, at least in casual mode. if you do, you'll probably get sexist comments hurled at you, or if they just think you've got a high pitched voice, called a squeaker and might even get kicked. a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist, sexist, homophobic, and every -ist and -phobic thing in the book into the chat. it's painful to read, but hey, it sure is fun getting dominations on homophobes and then taunting after killing them. so that's something you can do.of course, it isn't all bad. and most games of this nature end up with a community like that anyway, so it's no surprise really. there are a bunch of good folks out there too. i've met some good folks through this game, and if you play it for long enough, you will too. just don't be surprised about the bad folks. plus there's a bunch of different sub-communities that are usually full of nice people.tldr; it's a good game, and it's free to pick up and play so you've got nothing to lose but your time. it's fun, has a bad overall community but nice little sub-communities, unique and fun characters, and a lot of cool maps. play it and have fun.",1

1397,"honestly, this is one of the best fp game that exist bar none. the grinds are not bad and the rewards are decent. the best part about this game are the developers which i have said about no other game ever. they read the forums and will react to feedback sometimes responding to your post directly. i have literally only had issues with the game and after submitting a ticket they were resolved in less than hours. the gameplay is good but not overly complicated. the graphics are good but again strike a good balance for my machine aka i can run everything on high but not ultra. this game is a great fit for me because i do not have a bunch of free time and just want to unwind for a couple of hours and get in a few co-op matches and snatch a few drop pods. so if you are a casual gamer who doesn't have a ton of free time i highly recommend you give it a spin. it is easy to learn but not so easy to master so there is depth. the maps look good, the ships look good the ai is decent. if you are more competitive it can accommodate that as well. the only thing holding this title back is it needs more players so install it and give it a try. if you like space combat/sci-fi then it will not disappoint.",1

8940,"this is a sheer spectacle, unmatched in its execution of warfare. columns of tanks, careening airships and neverending explosions, all contained throughout huge landscapes. there's nothing quite like hitching a ride in a dropship, watching your entire air fleet being riddled to shreds as the pilot desperately thottles towards his destination. or when an idyllic base on the outskirts suddenly becomes a screaming meat grinder during an overwhelming attack. and hey, there's even those moments when there is nothing to do but patrol a recently claimed continent, driving around aimlessly in the hopes of an upsurge in enemy activity. so, yes, this is an amazing package all wrapped up in a pure multiplayer format. given the scale, it's fairly amazing that the servers hold up well enough to accomodate hundreds of players running amok on a huge playground. but, is it fair? no. being free-to-play, it is obvious that cash will quickly upgrade your pitiful vehicles and mediocre guns. sure, you can play to earn these things, but it is generally an uphill battle that requires tons of hours, all while being smacked back from lock-on-missiles and advanced max units. generally, this isn't a huge issue anyway, since all fights are usually won by sheer numbers. one-on-one fights won't be fair to you, but you and thirty others versus one will make you feel a lot better. the game isn't about fairness anyway, so you can easily play this game and think to yourself, i can't believe i didn't spend any money on this. because even as a lowly grunt you are still a part of an amazing battle.",1

26270,"i mean, that depends on what you mean by this. insofar as oppressive gender roles go, you're correct in that it's ancient, but hte specific dynamic of men being breadwinners while women are housewives doing domestic work is actually relatively new, getting its start in the th century alongside industrialization. the idea that women can't or shouldn't do hard labor would have been utterly laughable in, say, the th century where women obviously were doing a lot of farmwork right alongside their husbands. and even with the industrial revolution, a lot of women did factory jobs.the breadwinner dynamic could only have existed under a very specific set of circumstances, namely a) capitalism, because the entire concept is predicated on wage labor and not, say, a self-sufficent agrarian community where the whole community is taking care of each other and raising children communally b) very high wages that humanity hasn't really seen before or since that enable one man's income to afford a house and support not only a wife but multiple children, none of whom do wage or farm labor (though the wife would have been working her ass off maintaining that property, a lot of drug abuse happened during this period by middle class white women that just kind of doesn't ever get acknowledged).the whole two-story house paid outright on one man's labor thing in particular came about over cold war fears of nuclear war. suburban sprawl was seen as a way to counteract the damage a nuclear strike would do, as dense urban centers were seen as unacceptably vulnerable and would have wiped out too much of the workforce. so that cheap housing on the outskirts of cities was kind of subsidized, with massive infrastructure projects (in parrticular highways) undertaken to enable a man's morning commute.a lot of modern bigotries really didn't exist in their current form hundreds of years ago. hell, in the 's *whitteness* didn't exist conceptually, nobody thought of themselves as white or someone else as black. racism's a relatively recent social construct, predated by sorta similar concepts like foreigner or barbarian that missed crucial elements like heredibility (so a child born to a barbarian could be seen as fully roman, whereas someone born to a black father would be considered black no matter what). the world really hasn't looked much like american culture for very long, and odds are it'll radically change again.",0
9967,"while i do love this game, there is a few problems with it.pros:*fast and fun action, especially with teammates.*the graphics, while not groundbreaking, is pleasing to look at.*every character is fun to play as and brings something different to the table, with ara and rena being my favorates.*there are a lot of good tracks in the game.cons:*the game will often encourage you to spend some real money on the game. things like costumes, extended skill slots, pets, etc.*game can get grind-heavy later on, not like maplestory grind-heavy, but in the very later dungeons you'll need to do a few dungeon runs before you can move on to the next mission.overall, i do like this game, but i can say the microtransactions can be a turnoff for some. if you are interested in trying it, play the game for a few hours, maybe go to lv or something, and then deside if it's worth investing a few bucks.*update*: okay, taking a look at the prices and i can say that some of these are insane. i think spending around $ for a single costume set is a bit much. then again, look at what we're paying unusuals...",1

9742,"i've read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguning because they look similar. because both characters have red headed swordsman, female elf archers, and purplehaired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other. but where the difference ends. story: the story is that a stone called the el were stolen by bandits and its up to the el search party to get it back. the story moves on to each village to move the story. the el stone story ends at altera when you finish the quest tunring everything back to normal. then story goes to feita with an demon invasion. the story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or naruto. ./characters: there are currently characters on both versions. what suprises me about them are that / characters included demons. chung, ara haan, and elesis. the character are elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, cung, ara haan, elesis, and the insane add. i like add the most because of his backstory, gameplay, and personality (reminds me of lasercorm from smosh games). i feel mad for raven, chung, ara, and add. raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers, his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who u can fight in the first dungeon in altera. chung's dad got possesed and almost died from severe injuries. ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon (final boss of hamel) and add family got killed (not by demons), sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation. the backstories suprises me with any way. (thank u south korea) ./gameplay: by comboing your enimies to oblivion through special/actives skills. when u reach level you'll be able to choose multiple paths. for elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, and chung. for ara and elesis and currently for add at the time. you will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend k-ching and you'll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the nd job at level . either quest line or pay k-ching you're pick. what i really love about elsword is he final dungeons. the final dungeons supply you exp for you to level up and a challengin boss. there's a dungeon called henir's time and space which actually a boss rush mode. i've seen videos of player beating it with they're best time. there are also secret dungeons when u get to the level cap (). however there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields. when all of the stamina runs you can't dungeon untill : a.m. ./pvp: the match making... is absolutley broken. my level elsword is set with a max level elesis. you start playing pvp at level its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later. ./community: the only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms. ./cash shop: i can't get enough with the cash shop. costumes. check. quick slot extensions. check. pet adn mounts. check. inventory expansion. check! /final verdict: i love this gams with a passion. i have over hours in to this game and my highest level is a add. combo monsters to oblivion. the gamplay is good. pvp is below average. the stamina can get annoying but who cares. ./",1

15068,"just any other free to play game, you should pick this up for an hour and give it an open-minded go.in this game you build a tiny vehicle (i say vehicle, because robots do not require a pilot, because it is esstentially it's own pilot, but vehiclecraft doesn't sound as good, so i'll call it a robo) and then fight using it against other players who have built their own robot.you can build whatever you want. if you have the parts, it can be made. i've seen people make literal spider walkers (are usually seen in challenge mode or late into the game, like % into it), an smg car shaped like a person, a heavily armored box car, a car only describable as a quad from dune , even a flyingthat one time.you can make jets, hovercrafts, drones, actual drones, helicopters, tanks, cars, and you can get to the end of the game's current progression to make gigantic versions of these where you can either pit it against tons of smaller, weaker enemies, or fight in a battle filled with giant robos!i have only gotten % into the game, tier , but already i can make hovercraft, cars, tanks, hybrids of either of those and stuff.there are indeed weapons, and they all have their own uses and strengths and ways of using them. indeed, this isn't call of duty where tons of weapons exist, but all of them in a category all work basically the same.you've got weapons. smgs, plasma cannons, railguns, and nanotech disruptor which heal allies and deals damage to enemies in a straight beam.the game abides by physics most of the time, so if your robo is not properly made, then you can expect to find problems, luckily there is a practice mode that has no penalty or reward, filled with enemies you can test your robo against, some of them potentially player-made (that needs to be a thing if not! <)this game is fun, just... don't get discouraged if some turd with a railgun goes into tiers , or . it happens a decent amount even though tier really should be a cut-off point for tech being below the tier it was meant for (aka railguns below tier battles, or helicopters below tier . walkers below tier isn't much of a big deal honestly because they're cool to the point i wished there was a tier version of them).you won't be able to make the robo you want to from the get-go (i personally have an obsession for walkers, sometimes bordering on fetish-territory if you throw on some missile launchers and beam cannons onto it xd).the only real downside to the game is the inability to mix and match weapon types. i suppose it helps for balance reasons, but it'd be cool if you could have two weapons at a time. though then you could have medic guns on railgun planes, which would be a tad unfair.each different item has its purpose and use, th only thing that is really much of an exception are the blocks, but they are instrumental in being tough to destroy as without them... well you're not tough to destroy as the original blocks are free for a reason.spoiler: they're garbage above tier .there's also electro plates, which are indeed shield technology, but the precursor to it.feel free to download this game and give it a try, it's really quite fun! personally building the robo is my favorite part, let alone actually using it, which is even better.it's really fun.i also give this game a /, which says alot for it's current state. there's not alot of bugs left and the devs have taken time and actually tried in their endeavor to make a great game which has probably very little content in comparison to the finished result, and bugs or glitches pretty much.ps: this game has support for us ocd buggers who have to symmetry everything in the mirror mode. press x or map the key in the controls menu under buildhappy building, and merry killing!",1

8576,"so...i started playing this game about a week ago. absolutely loved it. it's important to note that i usually hate battle royale games. but not this game.this game took (emphasis on past tense), all the things i hated about the battle royale genre, and threw them out the window.it was colorfull, without being minecraft. it wasn't a camping simulator. and the rgn in this game was limited.you were encouraged, no, required to fight, if you wanted to have a good chance at winning. the best weapons and equipment didn't randomly drop somewhere, you had to craft them at a forge. crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player. this, and the fact that you got a reward (shards, which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general) whenver you killed another player, made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights. because fights were encouraged, and they were worth taking the risk.people couldn't just drop somewhere far off, loot everything and then camp.that is, until a few days ago. ignoring every bit of community feedback, the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out, and unique, and good, and threw it out the window.it's the same rng infested, camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now, that every other battle royale game already is too.you can find dozens of similar games now, with the only difference between them and this game being, that they are less colorfull, and their developers probably don't ignore the feedback from their community (unlike this game)",0

1651,":did not play much for this year due to work.:after years of dota , all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, monkey king is coming out in december this year.dota has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as basketball and football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win. through the recent gameplay patches of . and ., there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely scans and cheaper more defensive items.new items such as echo sabre and hurricane pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.everything can workas a whole, dota has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand. no particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. be it eg's methodical lane dominance and calm style, mvp phoenix's all-in teamfight style, ehome's strategic drafting style, or ti winners - wings' anything goes style.valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for dota and virtual reality support for spectating. overall, its been a good year for dota , the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.:over the course of a year, dota has slowly introduced its source game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of warcraft 's battle.net. the international tournament is also a huge success and has a record $. million, of which $. million were contributed by community spending. valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.it is also clear that dota will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being december holidays, chinese new year and halloween. with regards to porting over dota 's legacy, there are only heroes left: arc warden and pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.at this point, the longevity of dota is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to valve's steam client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.icefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with valve for dota 's future back in . i hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.:dota just keeps improving over time. at the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around - years later. the community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. the cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. as a competitive game oriented towards esports, dota 's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and the international's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. it has grown exponentially from $. million in , to $. million in and is projected to hit $ million in .dota has also recently implemented ranked matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an elo-style rating. while it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. it is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.:valve inc. has proven that they will continue to support dota in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. the game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.matchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.:dota requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment. free to play! all heroes are free and available. items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit dota 's medieval setting.:this is a game for the competitive pc gamers. dota , the sequel to dota features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. the ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make dota a complete game experience. no two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other aaa pc games out there. this game is a definite buy for me. what will it be for you?",1

15796,"a developer from artix entertainment had requested reviews from players after only being in open beta for one hour which is a bit of a joke but i have enough to make a review so here it is.quick review for those with more time on your hands.is it worth playing: not really there are better games out there for free unless you intend to play on tablet or androidhow would you rate it out of ? : a solid its a game equivilant of meh would i recommend to others : nope id suggest playing adventure quest worlds instead is it a lot better constructed considering it is a sider scrolling web based game.---the first and biggest issue is the fact that this game was originally aimed at pc players of aqworlds as the next aq game and yet they spent so much time making the controls work for mobile/tablet users that they have forgotten how make it interesting for pc players. character customization : it is pretty standard and not a lot of variations even with the added barber shop into the game so not alot to talk about there.the pathing and quest system are a joke because as of right now after you finish the tutorial you and just smack bang in this town that you are expected to know the layout and locations of everything with just random npcs offering you quests for npcs that you cannot find by a tracker or even in the quest information. so you are literally screwed from the word *go* and if you have no prior experience of the game you are screwed.now onto monsters : at the moment of writing this it is in open beta so its to be expected that things need to be worked out, but currently i was dealing /th of the damage i was being dealt by monsters of the same level as myself and for the sake of arguements i was a fully geared warrior so it makes zero sense that i should be getting destroyed by one monster as the same level as me.combat system: this is where i believe that artix entertainment has done quite well for themselves because the actual animations of the attacks are quite good so in that regards i commend them but due to the long drawn out animations it would seem that where i as the player would get one special move off the opposing monster/s will be able to get or even attacks off therefore rendering my damage pointless because they have caught up to my damage spike and even done some more which inturn requires me to demolish my supplies of potions that i have/had.ui/menu : again i honestly think artix entertainment has really done well on the ui and menu system, for a phone or tablet game, there is no need to restrict pc users to such a simplistic and just empty screen and weirdly enough they have locked the chatbox to the topleft of the screen even though ther is nothing else on the bottom left, which is another indication that they only thought about phone and tablet users.sounds and music : i think the music is alright not the best but what the hell its better than nothing am i right ? but when looting or attacking it suddenly gets extremely loud and every time you loot a monster it is preset to make the sound of a chest opening when your opening a bag, now thats just lazy because it doesnt take a lot of time to make different sounds for different containers of items that monsters will drop. the attacking noises are extremely loud for really no reason in really random areas, such as making that trademark *sheen* noise when it is swung but it is so loud if you really want to listen to it id highly recommend making the sound very low.",0

4558,"this review is for those who are already familiar with mobas and have played dota or league of legends. i will point out what makes smite unique compared to those games.- third person camera perspective. unlike the classics, smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character. this allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability. - (almost) every ability in the game has to be aimed, including melee and ranged basic attacks! that's right, if you want to play the ad carry in smite, prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can't land your basic attacks. same goes for everything else: if you can't hit your abilities reliably, you will not succeed, there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed. from the other perspective, this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations. many times i was one hit away from death, but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements, i survived. - playable characters (heroes, champions) in smite are real gods from pantheons that were once (and some still are) worshipped. norse, roman, mayan, hindu, chinese, greek. play as zeus, thor, odin, loki and many other gods and mythical creatures. hirez studios does a (mostly) great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable characters. and for those deities you don't know, there is always a lore section for every god, so you even learn something about different cultures while you play. yay, knowledge!- different game modes + one that changes every day. unlike its competitors, smite features many different game modes aside from the classical vs (here called conquest). arena (vs, no lanes, team deathmatch), siege (vs, two lanes, small jungle), joust (vs, lane, small jungle), assault (vs, all random all mid, lane). the mode of the day changes every day and features fun setups (like vs on the assault map and everyone get's the same god).all of these game modes have their own, detailed and well crafted map. in conquest mount olympus opposes a vulcano, in arena you fight in a grand colloseum, in assault you defend the halls of asgard from the forces of chaos, in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforests and in joust you're a knight for some reason (it will be changed to a chinese themed map soon). in addition to that, smite features one of the best deals in a free to play game: the god pack. the god pack costs $ and contains every god currently in the game. owners of the god pack also receive the newest god as soon as they're released. forever. that means, the more gods join the battle of smite, the more value you get for your $. you do the math. why should you play smite over league or dota? if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas, but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones, smite will be the game for you. it's highly skill-based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional mobas do not have. i played league of legends for years, but after i got athritis (this is a joke) from playing adc and kiting for too long, i gave up. for me, smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional mobas never did. i will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about smite, i am not delusional:many skins in smite are locked behind chests, which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them, you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want. it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god is announced, only to later find out it's in a chest with other items. hirez abuses this a bit too much. though we have the god pack, so that balances it out.eu servers can be very unreliable. quality control at hirez is either non-existent or very bad. some new gods release in a pitiful state, either balance or design-wise. they have horrid animations, amateur-like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered. some god designs are also very questionable. sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their lore, or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense. did you know the spartans put the statues of ares, the god of war, in chains to restrain him? yeah, that's cool, but only a small footnote in his lore. well, what hirez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact. he shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield. the shield has a demonic visage on it, where the fire comes out. does that sound like the greek god of war to you? not to me. but these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience. i've been playing this game for more than a year, and only looking forward. it's free in the end, so why not try it out and look for yourself?",1
12606,this game have awesome driving physics sounds and i really like it true simulator with online but i give this game big thumbs down because of multiplayer and microtransactions.-big ammount of multiplayer servers not working for me (okay maybe its my network or someting fault)-the servers that work for me are the exclusive pack ones even if i can play online still there a lot of fun servers that you need to pay for wich isnt that cheap-really small ammount of starter cars (free ones)-limited to just a few free classes even free classes have paid cars so i really hate thisi understand they need to earn money by those cars and maps but there is other way or maybe just few more classes or every free class to be completly free that will be good.its sad that this good game was this bad,0

12943,"you don't even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything you've built up. i started a second game after getting a better understanding of the mechanics, got an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward, used training rooms to amp up the stats of my residents, and how was i done in? a single random group of burrowing mole rats made me burn through all of my stimpacks, and killed over half of all my characters (levels ranged from about to for an average of or so). we're talking about the nd weakest enemies in the series besides radroaches here! i swear on my honor and sanity, during that same sequence that made me rage quit, i had vault dweller armed with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe had armor-piercing capabilities (i uninstalled the game the second i quit so i can't confirm) vs. the last molerat in the vault, fired about to vollys of shots, and the rat still killed him! this would seem to suggest that standard enemies can get stronger if you don't meet some arbitrary gameplay milestones. not that you'd know given that the help section says nothing to that effect, there's no level indicator for enemies, and you also can't get a numerical value for their health, or depending on the circumstances, even a health bar! i assume this because to get feral goul attacks in my previous run, but i decided to wait on making babies to power level stats this time. the final record for how long i lasted in the game before getting royally screwed was goddamn days.to clarify, after the basics have been introduced and your vault population expands new training rooms that increase stats are unlocked. this is because the only thing that leveling does is increase your character's health, but said health increase is supposedly greater if the endurance stat is increased. but just like everything else in this damn game, there's absolutely no way to know what the hell impact it's having. let me just go over the things the game will never let you know: the aforementioned extent to which endurance impacts health increase, the numerical value of the character's health, the default likelihood of anything happening when using the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or having a deathclaw randomly show up at your vault door, what stat (if any) governs melee weapons' effectiveness, how close/far a character is from building up to a critical attack, and with regards to rooms, almost everything. want to know to what extent merging rooms helps before spending money? too bad! want to know precisely to what extent increasing training room speed helps before spending thousands of caps to upgrade it? too bad! want to know if the help section (aka bethesda) is bsing you regarding training speed going faster with more people in the room? well i sure as hell didn't notice any difference. want to know whether you have the crafting resources/recipies necessary to make something in the later crafting menus before spending thousands of caps upgrading a weapon crafting room? too bad!even the radroaches can be completely absurd! get like one stuck in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and it'll be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be heard, but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and to can turn into to for no reason! and one of the rooms is literally incapable of housing residents despite being a location enemies can spawn in! and just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae, your little vault minions could only be more incompetent if they shot themselves! if an enemy walks into another room, your poor helpless flamethrower-brandishing uber-guard suffers from crippling depression that prevents him/her from pursuing due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be dragged by you every single damn time! but don't think that it ends there: melee enemies on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper-rifle weilding vault-dweller on the opposite side, and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understands that if there's one thing that a time-sensitive, resource-draining, cluster f@(# of a combat sequence needs, it's for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary locations within a room before actually opening fire, or putting out a literal fire! and on top of that, human combatants will often stumble and stagger for what feels like an eon after loosing all their health dragging out the time that resources can't be produced for even longer. thus putting you in the position of sitting there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama-queen raiders drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dwellers being equally passive, even as the sirens blare and the resource bar flashes like it's actively being depleated. i knew bethesda were hopelessly inept in most respects but i didn't think they'd find a way to screw up we're giving you this for free!think that's the end of the bs? nope. if you look through the help section, it turns out that the radio that can be used to attract people to your vault, as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door opens has the capacity to bring deathclaws charging into the vault...deathclaws. and if my experience with the molerats and roaches is any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room, never take any damage, and somehow fill my computer with malware, take money out of my account for microtransactions, and give me cancer. it's never happened to me, but again, i only ever got as far as feral gouls, so it's probably a late-game thing.with the gameplay being a mindless grindfest, the only other possible asset is story which, as one would naturally expect from a free game is nigh non-existant in terms of being a source of sincere motiveation. you're a vault, and there are people in it, the end. oh, there are quests that you can send vault dwellers out on, assuming that you can spare any of them, your valuable equipment, and you build an overseer room. even after all that you're rewarded with staring at a travel progress time for hours on end because it can take up to hours (likely more since the travel times seem to increase as the quests progress and i think i recall one having a hour time to start with) to get to/from a location for one mission. so good luck trying to stay invested in quests that have you sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for one or two lines of dialogue to give you any more story before making you do it all over again.and on a personal note, the game is an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because there's more incest than a southern... probably should stop now before i violate steam's guidelines regarding user posts before i finish that. but the point is, there's no amount of in-family screwing that can't occur in the game. the weirdest thing is that the game actually kind of encourages it with the mechanics... no i'm serious, character names can repeat so it's difficult to keep track of who's related to who, and it takes hours for radio calls to bring people to your vault... if they bring people to your vault. that was one of the reasons i had only like to characters for so long, i was trying not get parents and siblings to get down with one another. but with the way this game presents them you'd think humans were mice or something. anyway, that was just a niggling aspect that bothered me, the more substantive issue is the gameplay.i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again. if you haven't played new vegas before then my question is: what in the hell are you doing looking at bethesda to make a good fallout game?! go play new vegas instead! (i'd recommend wastland but i haven't played it yet, though it's in the same vein as fallout so i guess it'd be worth a look).",0

9421,"realm of the mad god is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by wild shadow studios (acquired by kabam in june , and later sold to deca games in july ) and spry fox. it was in public beta from january and the browser version launched on june , .[] on february , the game was made available on the digital distribution platform steam for microsoft windows and os x.[]the game has been described as a massively-multiplayer cooperative bullet hell shooter with an bit pixelated art style.[] players control characters who have been transported to the realm of oryx (the titular mad god) to become food for his many minions and abominations, which the players must dispatch. central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a limited capacity vault away from danger. different character choices in class also help make the game more diverse and help to support teamwork.the game is free-to-play with optional in-game micro-transactions. items which can be bought with optional transactions include in-game equipment vary from high-level equipment, pets that provide aid to the player (by attacking enemies, paralyzing enemies, healing the character, restoring the character's magic points, and acting as a decoy) increased storage space, and aesthetic features such as skins, cloths and dyes.[]this game client is written in flash and can be played in-browser on the official site, on kongregate, or it can be downloaded from the google chrome web store. realm of the mad god is also available on steam.[]contents [hide] gameplaydevelopmentreceptionreferencesexternal linksgameplay[edit]the game consists of players shooting projectiles from their weapons and destroying enemies to earn experience, fame, and equipment. a character moves around using the wasd keys (though other controls can be chosen) and uses the mouse to aim and clicks to shoot.[] contrary to usual practice in mmos, the experience for killing monsters is awarded in full to each player present, rather than split. this, along with the possibility of teleporting to any player on the map instantly and a cooldown of seconds to teleport again, makes it very easy and attractive to team up.after a certain amount of experience has been earned, the player levels up and their attributes are raised, allowing them to fight more powerful enemies and unlock more classes. the maximum level a player can achieve is level . the player can then gain fame on their character, which eventually grants permanent stars that indicate accomplishment and may entitle one to a place on the game's leaderboards upon death. character death is permanent, meaning that the character's items and statistics are lost.players begin their game sessions in the nexus, a safe haven which can be teleported to at any time. in the nexus, players may buy consumables using gold purchased with real-life money or they may trade with another character. another currency is fame, gained when you die. the player enters realms (i.e. game map instances present on the server). each of these realms are named after powerful monsters in the game(i.e. medusa, djinn, cyclops, beholder). the capacity of each realm is people at once, and a full realm cannot be entered until a player in it dies or leaves. however, if many players enter a realm at the same time, it can exceed .players fight a monster in game. hud elements such as the inventory can be seen on the right-hand side.during gameplay, the player is directed to quest monsters indicated by a red marker at the edge of the game window. as they level up in the realm, they are guided from the lowlands areas at the edges of the map, through the midlands and highlands to the more difficult godlands in the center of the map. the godlands hosts powerful monsters known as the gods of the realm. completing certain quests allows event bosses to spawn, which can be killed to obtain higher-tier loot and open portals to the rarest dungeons.killing high-level monsters can grant the player permanent stat boost potions, which are rare and exist in eight variations that correspond to the major attributes(life, mana, vitality, wisdom, defense, dexterity, attack, and speed). consuming stat potions allows the player to improve their characters stats after reaching the highest level, which can be done until the attribute is maxed out (indicated by its text turning gold). upon death, the size of the grave left behind corresponds to the number of stats maxed. items could previously be retrieved from graves, but this functionality was removed as it led to players luring others to their doom to loot their graves.the classes currently available are wizard, priest, archer, rogue, warrior, knight, paladin, assassin, necromancer, huntress, mystic, trickster, ninja, and sorcerer. players begin with only the wizard class unlocked and successively unlock the remaining classes as they gain experience with each class.[] there are main stats, defense, attack, speed, dexterity, vitality, wisdom, mana, and life. each class has its own weapon, armor and ability specifications, base statistic averages and statistic caps. for example, warriors, knights, and paladins have high defense and are the only ones that can use swords and heavy armor, while the assassin, rogue and trickster have the highest potential movement speed and dexterity (rate of fire) statistics and can only use daggers and hide armor.items are classified into tiers, with higher tier items having better stats. tiers range from t-t for weapons, t-t for armors, t-t for rings, and t-t for abilities.[] some items are un-tiered, giving them a special classification. these items are typically unique, with examples including limited use items, powerful weapons, armor, rings, abilities, and april fools' day accouterments. the best items appear in special bags, known as white bags, purple bags, cyan bags, or potion bags. these bags will only drop for players who have delivered a certain percentage of the monster's damage, and can only be seen and picked up by the player it dropped for. un-tiered (ut) items are currently soulbound which means it is unable to get picked up by any other player or traded to another player.the game features guilds, each allowing for a maximum of players. a guild costs the founding player fame to name and create, and has a guild hall which can be accessed by members of the guild. upon a member's death, guild fame is earned proportionally to the amount of fame that the player earned. guilds can buy upgrades such as larger guild halls and cosmetic features with the guild fame.[]development[edit]the game was originally created by alex carobus and rob shillingsburg, founders of wild shadow studios, for tigsource's assemblee competition in october , which limited the competitors to a very small sample of art resources.[] the developers described the aim of the game was to shake things up by breaking as many mmo rules as we could[] it was noticed and received a good response from players,[] prompting the developers to work on a full game. the game was finally launched in a beta stage on january , .[]following the initial launch, spry fox joined the development team, helping bring the game to a full release out of beta on june , .to help fund the game's development, optional microtransactions were added to the game, drawing a mixed response from players.[] the developers defended the microtransactions, saying they seemed like the most convenient, customer-friendly way to pay for the game... those that passionately love the game, can spend as much as they want, helping us to grow the game over time.the game has been",1

13475,"this is a great game, a hidden gem. i always questioned myself why this game isn't more popular? it's like minecraft yes, but a lot better than minecraft. the game is free and if you like you can purchase more type of blocks or the pro version, which gives you a glider, flashlight, more stamina and more storage room in your inventory. the developers are great and pretty active. give regular updates about what they are up to via live streaming. so, why it's better than minecraft?- it's free.- you can claim areas and give selected people permissions as to what they can and cannot do on your claim. even the admin of the world can't do anything on your claim (except to look in your storages and take items). this is a big problem in minecraft as people tend to steal your items.- you don't need to pay for servers, you can create your own world and let your friends play in it.- the maps are huge. enough room for everyone.- better graphics, animations and player movement.- blueprints allow you to put your creations in the steam workshop for others to download. you can also download blueprints of other people and use them in your world.- burst fill allows you to build blueprints a lot quicker. the sound and animation of burst fill are so satisfying.i played minecraft untill i found this game, then minecraft didn't see me again.if you're a serious builder who would like to have fun, you're more than welcome in my world nova empire. join us on discord: highly recommend trying this game out of you love sand box games or look for something better than minecraft.",1

3114,"this game has the potential to be one of the greatest flight sims ever. the selection of aircraft and tanks is absolutely enormous. there is a diffuculty mode for everyone, the flight models are decent, the damage model kinda sucks but it's not terrible. the aircraft and especially the tanks are very well detailed.i just wish i had the ability to enjoy them all. unfortuately, you can't. you will be stuck in the first and second tier early war stuff for hundreds of hours. i have a buddy who has been playing this game for years. he has over , hours in the game. he is a level . herein lies the problem of the game.you start off with the worst pssible vehicles, which is understandable. these are the bottem of the barrel planes and tanks. they are slow, they can not turn worth a damn, they have guns that mearly tickle your opponent, and they blow up when someone looks at you funny. you are stuck in these until you can get enough kill assists to unlock a new vehicle. you aren't killing anything with a mm cannon on the early tanks, or the pair of . cals you get in the peashooter. once you get those, you continue the grind upwards. it seems your first vehicle in any tier is just asking to be blown up. and, at every tier, every vehicle cost exponentially more. you would think that at higher tiers this wouldn't be a problem as you would be making more money, but you'd be wrong. you can take out a mustang, down two aircraft and return to base, only to find out that you still haven't broken even. at this point in the game, it can cost , lions to buy an aircraft and another , just to train the crew. it gets so goddamn grindy.now, the lower tiers are more fun. usually you can break even, fly against somewhat balance aircraft (panzer iv as a first tier tank. wut? i've put heat rounds through the front, hitting crew every time, and they can still one shot me through the mantlet), and enjoy the game without having to worry about shelling out shekels to the jewish developers just to fly your planes. grinding to unlock a plane in a free to play game? understandable. grinding low tierjust to fly high tier stuff you've already got? not understandable.absolutely the most frustrating game i have ever played. and the worst part about it is how much potential it has. potential wasted by money grabbing penny pinching jews that are gaijin.",0

8017,"just another voice to the choir. almost every negative review here on steam is spot on. if you are playing for the first time, leveling a character through you will most likely love this game and i would recomend it. it's has great combat that is responsive and fluid. the quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).it's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game. this is where the fun stops. the end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 's more times) again. some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the zen store that lets you skip them. yes for a mire $. each(yes $. 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns. think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game. that is just insane. keep in mind that it is only for one character too. those tokens are not an account wide option. so if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again. it almost seems like a cruel joke.on top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly. if you are someone that only has time to play maybe to hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money. i would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor. but now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment. all needing refinement to level up. if you played hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '' of these items. yes '' out of some - you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing. that is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the reagents needed for the upgrade. it's absolutely crazy. there is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.the other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes. neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update. i understand that this is needed for better game play. however as i mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it. when they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort. for example mod is going to change how regeneration and life steal works. anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. that can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.so if you're a new player starting out leveling a character though savior the moment. it's doesn't last for the end game. once you get to the end game i would recommend you move on to something else.",0

2119,"tl;dr at the bottom.how should i start this off..well, this game is a free mmo hack n' slash type game, with a large skill tree and many builds/characters you can make to destroy your opponents with. when it says free, it truly means free. the only thing not free, or micro-transaction, is the trails & certain masks as well as storage. so, in my opinion that really means it's free. because, you aren't forced to buy anything to do certain quests, or to proceed in the game. it's a well rounded hack n' slash game with very unique & clean combat. the skill tree is complex, and a build guide is highly recommended for all new players. it may seem a little... extreme the first time you open the skill tree, when i first saw it i wanted to run away and hide under a rock, but it's really nothing to be scared of. you will be met with people in the chat talking about l's and unique weapons, and weapons with certain stats etc. the only real learning curve to this game is asking people what it means, or using the poe wiki, which for new players i would say is extremely helpful. get this though, i don't know everything about this game.. at all, i am still learning a ton of the mechanics and the functions of certain things.pros +free to play.+complex & intriguing passive skill tree.+all around great game.+extremely addicting and worth the download.+actually free to play. don't have to spend money to pass quests.+no membership.cons-a small learning curve than will generally take about - hours to learn the more intermediate stuff. some great guides on the internet about it!tl;dr version:great game, amazing skill tree, actually free to play! so what are you doing here?! go play it!",1

2826,"this is the worst good game i've ever played.the level fo detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible. the fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof, the fact that you can use machineguns as airbrakes, the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are desctructible, and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour.the fact is, however, that literally everything about the game that isn't the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable.* everything above br -ish takes millions of years to unlock. even when playing with a premium account, you're looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semi-modern tank. if you don't have parts and you get tracked, you won't be able to move for the rest of the game.* whether you get to respawn or not is decided by how many spawn points you've earned. you earn spawn points for killing the enemy. so whatever side wins the initial engagement, always wins the rest of the game.* if you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo, you need to land on an air field and repair and refit. i can count on one hand the amount of times i've had time to get back to the map after rtbing, because the matches are incredibly short.* if your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to respawn, you can't choose to not respawn because you'll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points.* why don't you just spawn and die, then? because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money. at mid-br, repairs get insanely expensive. it is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills, capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money.* there hasn't been any changes to the above for the + years i've been playing.",0

16214,"free gun porn!!!world of guns: gun disassembly (wog) is essentially a catalogue of exploded diagrams for various firearms, except instead of two-dimensional isometric drawings, the component parts have been meticulously modelled in three dimensions. whats more, the component models can be manipulated, both individually and as assemblies. the camera controls (e.g. pan, tilt, zoom, track, etc.) allow fly-throughs of the models from any perspective, even those that would prove impractical in reality. there are also cutaway views and several levels of x-ray views, in addition to the lovingly rendered photorealistic finishes. whats more, the actions of each model have been animated, and the animations can be run at normal speed or a number of slow-motion speeds, with any of the views! this allows study of the ingenious mechanisms (e.g. springs, levers, cams, index wheels, gas porting, etc.) at a level simply unavailable anywhere outside the digital realm.the game aspect of wog involves dismantling and reassembling the guns, with challenges based on speed and accuracy. there is also a shooting range, although only a few of the guns can be used for target shooting.some of the models allow alternative parts to be fitted, such as different size magazines and custom grips, and some allow you to mount accessories such as suppressors and scopes. there is also a paint mode, where budding graphic designers and modellers can create custom skins for the models.the firearms catalogue is quite extensive and growing all the time, with community voting used to decide which models should be developed next. the majority of the catalogue is not initially available, being unlocked with experience points earned by performing tasks with the unlocked models. it is possible to purchase the entire library, but i would not recommend doing so immediately, as the higher complexity models will be very daunting before developing some familiarity with the system. it appears that there are also other, non-firearm models available for purchase, such as automobiles and animal skeletons, but i have not explored this. there is also a significant body of community-created content available via the steam workshop.i recommend that anybody with even a remote interest in firearms or mechanical engineering download and try wog. the price is impossible to argue with, and there is a chance that it will prove fascinating.",1

12051,"do not buy in the current state. thankfully, i was able to obtain a refund after hours of game time.it's been a good two days and nothing notable has been done by the bless team to fix the plethora of issues the game faces. i cannot recommend this to anyone until the devs fix a huge majority of their issues. they've got a really huge wall in front of them to overcome if they are to hope to succeed.after giving the bless team some time (since ea launch days ago) to iron out their issues, nothing notable has been done to address the plethora of issues that it is facing.the issue that everyone faces is the incredibly poor performance - both server side and client side. in addition to that, frequent maintenance & server crashes worsen the experience (but of course, this is to be expected for any mmo launch). fps wise without the player-made tweaks, i got below fps in towns and a frequent below fps outside of towns (my rig runs gtx, gb ram, i-). on a side-note, there have been guides written by players (not developers) to help alleviate the fps issues which work to some extent but still does not help the experience too much (and rightfully, it should be the devs who published the guide or patch to address this issue, not the players).gameplay wise, it is not what one would expect for a price tag of / usd (and above) - the entire world is unpolished. dialogue, quests and plot are poorly written and boring. animations are blocky and unpolished. sound effects are horrible (sounds like what i would get from an indie game) - voice acting is worse. i did a level dungeon that had a cooldown of a couple of minutes which makes absolutely no sense in an mmorpg that requires you to grind for levels and loot. loot in dungeons with a party follows the traditional bid system and does not prioritize giving the item to the correct classes. another gripe i have with the game is that if a player tags a field mob first, the mob's rewards are his and only his.i grinded to mid-endgame thinking that the game would be more fun then, but it isn't - it's the same thing, except with field pvp (and people ganging up to get kills).the combat system has potential, but isn't quite there yet. i enjoyed being able to have options to chain my combos into - based on what i wanted and how i planned to attack. however, the two most blatant frustrations that i have (and other players too) are:. missing an attack would completely reset the combo.. using a non-stance ability would reset the combos. this is incredibly painfully frustrating for me. coming from ff where we have off-gcd abilities, i cannot fathom as to why the developers would decide that using a non-stance ability should reset the combos. that makes it incredibly counter-intuitive to use any of your non-stance abilities - which means you either use them before you start combos or at the end of the combos only. so why would i want to blink mid-fight if i cannot for-the-love-of-god chain my high-damage combos or stuns? why would i want to cast counterspell when it completely disrupts my combo? if you have played league of legends before, imagine you're yasuo, you have stacks of gathering storm (q) and you're going to go in for the huge knockup play, but you have to flash to get in range - but wait, flashing completely removes your stacks and you can't knockup anymore. neowiz, why?the combo resets make it seem as if the devs have not play-tested the combat enough, or even knowledgeable/talented enough to understand what constitutes a good and smooth combat flow.besides that, the game could do with an innate dodge ability besides the one non-stance ability you equip. blinking should also not lock your movement (there's a short .? second delay before you can move again) after usage.the skill/talent tree (whatever it was called) was confusing and poorly designed. it had combat stats, exp stats, gold stats all mixed into the same tree. it is also a linear skill tree for each of the four paths which makes it incredibly boring. leveling the skills / abilities / talents used some form of currency which i'm not sure how to obtain except from rewards through quests - not via leveling, which is really confusing (at least for me).crafting was.. meh. few crafting options, and lots of the materials i did not know how to obtain so i did not even bother much with crafting. i crafted some baguettes and a necklace only and gave up on the rest.repairing / enhancing / taming - tedious and confusing.besides that, another unacceptable issue is that the localization is incredibly poorly done - the worst i have seen for a game i have ever paid for. i cannot figure out most of my skills due to the poor translation. also, a prime example of poor localization is that the mailbox receive button is translated to gift - yes, gift which is supposed to be the button you click to receive items from the mail. it's as if they simply threw their localization strings into google translate, plopped it into the game and never looked at it again.another opinion i have is that the outfit design is really bland and boring - even those on the cash shop. i did not find even outfit to my liking.i had thought they would be able to iron out all the issues by launch day (or planned & shared a roadmap or informative post to address the issues) but it seems i was mistaken. all they have ever done is just post on character creation restrictions, adding new servers, maintenances and a notice that they were aware of server issues. then, they had the nerve to post about game balance (healing not as potent as damage) when the fundemental issues that actually allow for a smooth gaming experience weren't even addresed.what i liked:. character creation - good. it's good and has lots of customization options. i only didn't like the voice options, otherwise it's pretty solid.. combat - kinda. i had fun with the combat except for the few setbacks and frustrations i had mentioned above.tldr;the bad:. bad performance - fps ( & below on a good rig) & server lag.. poor gameplay - lackluster quests / storyline / dungeons.. bad audio - poor sound quality & bad voice acting.. disappointing combat - combos being cancelled/reset by missed attacks & usage of any non-stance abilities.. horrible localization - the worst i have ever seen. everything seems to be taken from google translate.. no roadmap/plans from devs on issue fixes.. (opinion) bland & boring outfits.. other issues faced by other players such as friends not being able to get in the same server and them getting their items server & character bound.the good:. character creation has lots of customization options except i didn't like the voices.. combat feels fun at first because of the many available combo-chain options but fails to impress later on due to the frustrating mechanics (see point above).thank you for reading and sorry for the incredibly long rant.",0

13568,"right, i've tried to like this game. i've got a significant playtime on a server with friends. i'm being as unbiased as i can. if minecraft didn't exist, perhaps creativerse would look better. as it is, by basing so much of its core gameplay off of minecraft, it really has no excuse to be this mediocre. this game is minecraft lite. it's minecraft made simple, with a lot of pretty blocks and cute pets, but basically nothing more. it's minecraft for the unambitious, the unimaginative. it's what you'd let your child play, if you thought she couldn't handle challenge or failure. in the process of lowering the learning curve, creativerse takes away the cool toys and leaves you with limits. no complicated redstone, instead have a wiring system that gets confused when you send two inputs into an object. no world-manipulation capabilities like pistons or dispensers; instead have logic gates made for you as individual blocks, and only the ability to turn off lights and open doors with wiring. no large-scale crop and animal farming, instead mine every individual crop. instead, feed/wash/harvest every individual animal, which you must also tame individually as it tries to escape or kill you. no risky death where your inventory falls into lava, instead respawn on this touchstone, which you can reclaim from anywhere in the world, place anywhere, and teleport to anytime.redstone and world-manipulation was the lifeblood of minecraft; the ability to change every block of the world was one thing, but the ability to make the world change at the push of a button, to imagine contraptions and make them so, that is why minecraft is timeless and so full of potential. there is no potential in creativerse. the game-makers think for you, and the player is limited by the makers' imagination as a result. hell, there isn't even rails or minecarts. early access is no excuse. in the time that this game has been in development, minecraft went from alpha to retail, complete with all of the core gameplay that gave the player so many possibilities. creativerse can't add more fundamental gameplay aspects without overhauling the game, so the future will likely bring only more pretty blocks and cute pets and nothing else.in other words, if you've experienced half of what minecraft allows you to do, then this game will make you very sad.",0

6742,"this game is still being developed, i understand that.however, from watching dev streams lately as well as playing since beta release i have come to the understanding that the us is favoured most of all, followed by the germans and then the ussr gets what's left.this is shown in a number of examples, both in gameplay mechanics and in available weapons (and their stats).the us seems to spam every match with tanks and other armoured vehicles (which are either too hard or too expensive to counter), the germans tend to do the same followed by the ussr and their underwhelming vehicles and expensive at weapons. also, on release, the ussr was started from scratch progression-wise wheareas the us and german factions were comfortably in the lead with many, many tank drivers, pilots, recon and the like. this forced a painful attempt to progress in battles as the ussr due to being very under-powered in the various ways previously mentioned.yes! i realise this is a freemium game. they 'need' to make money somehow i hear you all say, but really??!fp is slow and for the ussr completely not worth it (not to mention not at all worth it for any faction after a certain rank or set of weapon upgrades due to the negative costs for playing a match( even for very skilled players)) and that it what sucks about this game, money-grabbing. in order to progress or have decen chances at competing you must buy into the game and that is terrible. why offer a fp model when it's secretly forcing you to buy in to its pricey premium account??now don't get me wrong, i have enjoyed aspects of this game. the weapons available are cool and the maps are large and varying but the cons seem to outweigh the pros. atleast in my own opinion.pros:decent map sizesgood selection of weapons etcfairly accurate historiclygood game for a groupcons:poor mechanicsunbalanced factionsexpensive itemssubtly forced premium attemptlack of voiplack of competent playerbase\communication",0

9323,"when talking about planetside , the discussion eventually becomes what's the point? and then a whole intervention is staged and we all ask them to go get help and we're all very supportive and in the end it all turns out that they meant what's the point of doing x in planetside ? whoops.i may sound like an old war vet, but planetside had a lot of nice features that people refer to as meta-game that planetside seems to be missing.ps is a perpetual war: three distinct factions with their own pros and cons are fighting over the planet of auraxis and its many continents. what's the end goal? me if i know. the continents are filled with many bases and outposts that you must take with your faction. when you take that, you move on to the next, and the next, and the next... and eventually the enemy starts pushing back and you lose all those bases you just captured. it's one giant tug of war with no end. even if you take every possible base on a continent, the enemy factions have permanent footholds on each continent, so they can just push right back with no reprocussions. ps had more than three continents and each faction had one permanent sanctuary on another island rather than footholds on each landmass.there may be about + bases in the game but it feels like there's only about - different base designs. even though this game is still under constant development and base design changes are made often, they still feel like a patch job rather than a permanent solution... but to be fair, the original only had about with very minor changes in between, but still...however - ps, as a free to play fps, is very good. (especially after the optimization update!) the community is also really great, and i reccomend finding a good outfit to play with for the best possible experience with this game. there's nothing like joining a squad of other players to give the push you need to get to that second base, or to that one point, or even to own the skies and destroy the ground. the mmo of this mmofps really shines here. you can sometimes even join a group of random people and use the ingame voip to really getdone with perfect strangers who just happen to wear the same colors as you.if you're wondering about the ability to pay for things, it's a bit all over the board, but mostly good. all weapons can be purchased through in-game cash, but those weapons can also be earned just by just playing and earning certs. players can't buy upgrades for their classes, they have to earn those (but they can pay to earn them a bit faster.) everything left over is just cosmetic.but hey, it's free. play it. try it out. no harm to you. just give it a shot and you might enjoy it. if not, uninstall and go back to whatever you like.",1

6745,have folowed development for years (yes the horible browser launcher) and game does not change to any significant degree. sadly this game is not free to play but free to try becouse you will need to pay if you want to do anything else than run around with a gun as standart inf. this is not a bad thing but tanks are not balanced properly as they dominate. yes as inf you can kill it but good luck on open ground with that.so is this game funs as inf. well it can be however gun play is clunky at best (it got worse from last time i played it on browser). there is bad mouse accel wich makes aiming an absolute pain and no way to turn it of. the attacking team is at a big disatvantage becouse the camping side has a good atvantage due to headshot kill mechanics (hard to pull of on moving targets) and how difficult it can be to spot ppl. however getting headshots and kills is verry rewarding and there is real tension due to shot kills. conclusion: the game is verry good in places and at times however it is pay to win becouse everything that isn't standart inf is clearly better to a more or lesser degree. the game has issues balance wise and some smaller ones in other departmends but don't count on any of them being fixed sins there were no noticable changes in my to years of not playing the game. there are better free to play shooters and this game is only free to play in the most strict meaning of the word.,0

2357,"to start on a positive note, path of exile takes the diablo formula and expands on it in every single way possible. it has an incredibly complex crafting, leveling and gear progression system, which is growing and becoming more intricate with every single update and hasn't been matched by any other game in the genre to this date. the music is excellent, the environments are alluring and the lore is fascinating, but what brings the game down is a staggering amount of well documented technical issues that plague it, ranging from poor optimization to server stability. the servers simply cannot handle prime time, especially after the release of the new expansion. and since this is a free to play game, making server stability a priority is clearly not in the cards for the developers. it's completely understandable from a business standpoint; however the game is no longer playable for me and many other people in its current state. even if you were to overlook the incredibly poor optimization of its dated engine, the developers refuse to focus on stability issues, churning out new content and micro transactions, instead of fixing the game and making it accessible to a larger player base. the issue will become more prevalent in the future, as more and more players jump on the bandwagon with every new expansion.",0

3667,"team fortress is a game release by our favourite company, volvo and as of today a successful and active game. i say active because unlike most games made by volvo, tf gets patched frequently as well as some updates such as the gun ettle update, smissmas, halloween and much more. before , tf was a purchasable game for $ but they made the game free forever. the presentation of this game is cartoonish which for most people looks stupid but once u get used to the graphics. even then i see the environment a bit messed up such as the rocks not being smooth. i personally feel like volvo should fix this to make the environment smooth.the gameplay is the most interesting and is the reason thousands of people are playing the game right now. there are classes to play as such as the scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy. each class holds a weapon specifically for them such as the soldier using a rocket launcher and the demoman using a grenade launcher. every class has weapon slots which is primary,secondary and melee weapons. many people rely on their primary weapon however classes like the spy and scout are better with a melee weapon. another big thing with every class is that u can unlock other kinds of weapons as your playing the game and unlocking achivements. some weapons are pretty much reskins of the default weapons but others have pros and cons such as the heavy`s brass beast which does more damage but takes a while to deploy. tf also has cosmetics ranging from head to toe. there are many diffrent kinds of cosmetics for each class. you can either craft hats or unbox them from crates which are also dropped time to time. speaking of crafting, you can craft weapons to make metal or another kind of weapon thats useful for you. another thing about tf that makes it fun is the variety of modes. there are as of now diffrent types of modes excluding random. there are modes such as capture the flag, attack/defense, payload and much more. there are even maps created by the community themselves such as suijin, mountain lab, turbine and much more. i give this game out of because despite this game coming out in , it is still an enjoyable game to play with friends. this game has improvement by a lot ever since its launch if you have a mic and not a squeaking voice, u may actually make some new friends throughout steam just watch out for scamers.",1

9407,"product received for freeas a beginner in this game i found it extremely hard, with the removal of ammys and addition to pets it didn't make it any easier, in my opinion the ones that has the hardest time in the game are beginners, sure if you have been putting in hours on hours on the game you deserve to be powerful right? yea that is true but as a beginner you die from taking shots from a ghost god in god lands, and someone who have been playing for a while, your / with a max legendary pet, you can be afk in godlands, and the only hard content for us i would say is the lost halls, where everything can oneshot you no matter what you do, thought i have not tried much of the new lost halls i've heard it's still very hard. shatters are becoming more and more of a joke. bring a friend along or two that are pretty experienced in shatters and you can do it in like minutes. when i first stepped foot into the shatters i got jumped by an ice sphere and i died. which also turned me away from the shatters for a long time, but now it's a joke. everything else is not even worth doing cos it doesn't give you anything cool. tombs are a great source for life pots but the rings are extremely inferior to shatters rings. ot sure the bow is nice and it's pretty easy for mana but like mana is pretty easy to get without an ot. the epic dungeons doesn't really give much, the leaf bow (how much i love it) is basically worthless. the doku has just a slight higher dps than the normal top-tiered katana. the cutlass barely exists. the only thing that are worth doing are the events that either deca puts out, or the realm events (sphinx, lotll etc.) but the only reason you want to do them is for that minimalistic chance for a white bag. but with all this why do i find the game fun anyways? well it's not really fun but you often have a reason to play! died recently? well you need to fill up that character with another maxed character. want to get higher than red star well go out and try out some other classes than knight and wizard. most classes are really fun imo. you'll never know which will be your favourite one if you've only tried / (soon to be / hype). well try the game out, but ill warn you, it's fairly addicting and extremely hard as a new player!",1

3608,"team fortress is a very decent racing game. first of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like heavy, soldier, and scout. the vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the heavy is the slowest, the scout is the fastest, and the medic is normal speed.classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. the medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. this will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the solider, is faster than the medic.the level design is beautiful, but take two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. but some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as fort, but there is no finish line,the fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. for example, the heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. it seems similar to mario kart, with the various courses and powerups. however, it fails to capture the fun of mario kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and blandthe major flaw in tf is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. there are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. valve did include a map that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. these maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.while the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. i wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this pc-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.",1
4597,"one of the most toxic player bases in the moba genre and that's with games like lol and dota with people telling others to kill themselves every game. however those games have the advantage of being good. kudos to smite for having varied game modes. and the third person perspective really changes up the formular. the game is serviceable - if you're willing to ignore the games glairing fault. its community. today for example i played games throughout the day. of which i was told to kill myself. had someone allude to my sexuality being less than favourableand other games devolved into petty name calling and sh*tposting rather than playing the game. the vast majority of players will throw games if you dont let them win their way.in a world where other, better, studios are taking big steps to fix their community. hi rez seem far more occupied with making questionably infringent copies of other games whilst not taking the time to help the community grow healthly. before you ask. yes these people were reported. no nothing happened. good times were had with this game. but playing this with other people makes me concerned for my own sanity. thus making it impossible to recommend this game to anyone. i had to warn a friend who was starting to be careful of people probably telling her to kill herself if she didn't play 'the right way'. she stopped playing soon after when i was proven right within mere moments of the warning.gameplay - /game itself -/",0

3823,"the premier online hat simulator, edition. if you are reading this and have never played this game, please don't start now. tf is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top. it has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics. it has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade. it has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)tf is as much a social platform as it is a video game. it's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics. there's also an fps minigame which i hear is occasionally populated. unfortunately, with the meet your match update in the summer of , valve removed the quickplay function from tf, killing off all community servers not named skial. now the landscape consists of / fort, harvest, hightower and turbine. it's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.with mym valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers. the casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be. it's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game. player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason. tf still has huge balance issues. sniper, a poor fit for the game in , is insanely un-fun to fight against years later. there are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. the class needs a fundamental rework to remove the insta-kill all classes from any range mechanic. scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels. since , medic runs at scout speed with any medi-gun, making scout completely dominant in s competitive. heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion. core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all. since , heavy's minigun starts at % of its base damage. spy is both up and op at the same time. baguette now runs at medic speed, and faster than scout when he pops the dead ringer. valve nerfed the ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, valve overdid it by a factor of ). they have left the diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.as of this writing, the big tf cheats (the l word, the n word, and the c word) are all undetected. hackers are rampant in valve's competitive and casual modes, and there's plenty on the few populated community servers as well. the hasn't been a major vac ban wave in tf for all of .all of this would be problematic but possibly understandable if valve were a small company keeping their game alive. the company is worth nearly billion dollars at this point. half of that is in gaben's back pocket. there's like dudes who work on tf (valve has claimed up to at one point) and while i am sure they are working hard, they're very understaffed.valve's flat structure was a dumb idea years ago, but the company did manage to produce many gems for their first decade. for the last years, the company has grown hugely and made so much money they don't even know what it means to give a . the company's internal structure actively works to the detriment of the customers.if you're still reading and you've actually played this game, you know what i'm talking about. i'll see you on doublecross later this evening.",1

935,"i was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):my opinion: solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad. if played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. if you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. the devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game. the negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. but really my negatives are limited to that and i do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions. i suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. but when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. a lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. if anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. if i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what i see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. this isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect. since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.microtransactions: limited to skins essentially, you can't simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. there is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1

14446,"just quoting another review i totaly agree with. stay away from this game. simply put, the development team (freejam) is utterly incompetent. there have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). instead, freejam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. this accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, freejam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.other major issues with the game:) building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. any new player can slap something together in minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. in fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, freejam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. either they'll nerf your movement or make various components times heavier, etc. regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did because freejam said so.) significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. simply put, freejam rarely gets weapon balance % right, or even close to it. in the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. there are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). ) freejam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. they won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. instead, freejam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. things like clans have been on freejam's radar since mid- or earlier - and guess what? still not implemented, and it is almost mid-. the sad part is, by the time freejam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. ) minimal skill required. if you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. freejam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. this might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.freejam: one step forward, two steps back. always.",0

8261,"note: the review has been updated to include the campaigns content.neverwinter is an mmo by perfect world entertainment. this allows us to predict two things:. the amount of cash required will be huge.. the classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual d&d races, and have a choice of class. this confirms suspicion in that there is the devout cleric (healer) guardian fighter (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).you'll have an option between the control wizard which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very squishy. the main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.the great weapons fighter which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. standard front-line damage-dealer. this class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.the trickster rogue who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. this class's main job is to kill the bosses.the hunter ranger who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. the hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. the skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.combat is simple in this game: you have two at will attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.you then have three encounter skills, which are basically active skills. mapped to qer by default.lastly, you have a daily power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of action points which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and i assume tanks block or absorb damage (though i haven't made one to confirm it). these could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to and by default.there's the feat system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.and then there's the two active passives slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not feats (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.you can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.equipment is your standard mmo system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):-white common basic equipment.-green uncommon equipment.-blue rare equipment.-purple epic equipment.-orange (?).purple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level dungeons, while tier is obtained from more difficult level dungeons.so far, so standard. where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in diablo), and those have several ranks. you can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a % success rate at level (rank is the highest).if you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.well, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.i should probably mention the artifact system. these are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. the primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.each player gets one at level in a bind on equip state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. this bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.the game features a companion system. free players get a white one, which can reach rank (equivalent to player level ). for $, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank (equivalent to player level ).bag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. the large bag costs ( slots) $.storage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.pvp exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.one-hit-kills are fairly frequent.story-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear r.a. salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. the entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.the writing is what you can expect from salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of satan and hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).the campaigns which i mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require astral diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.unfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to pvp.and, of course, i saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called astral diamonds. you receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in pvp) in a rough form, and must refine them in order to use them. the currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.astral diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).now, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. it costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. that is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. you can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.to top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous perfect world entertainment support is just worthless.so, over-all, would i recommand this game?well, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.otherwise, no, i'm afraid i can't recommand it.",0

3599,"team fortress is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. in the + hours i've spent with this game running, i've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who i respect and value dearly, made $, at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. it's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in college were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now. i was once a free-to-player. i played it for a good months before deciding to finally try being a premium. that's how it got me. i first bought a unique 'huntsman' from the in-game store. then i found a phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, i tried selling it for $ on tfoutpost. those were simpler times. from there i ended up investing $ (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. i could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but i really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. this is a very fun, very addictive game.it is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. at any given time, there's anywhere from ,-, players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game i've played. you will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. you'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.in light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell valve what they want and actually see a response. it's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. for many people, such as myself, i'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and i'll always be thankful for the time i've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences i would not have been able to otherwise.for the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, i give team fortress a very warm recommendation. just know when to put it down, remember, hours is close to months playing /.",1
1417,"updated th october :be aware that you can also be suspended for no good reason because the devs don't want people to play the game other than in one single linear strategy. week suspension received because having anything other than the devs strategy means you are accused of throwing a match.---original review below...this game has just gone from bad to worse.the match making is horrendous and alway has been since the introduction of team win / loose mmr opposed to personal skills / contribution being rewarded. the game just doesn't have enough experienced players for you not to have a team peppered with lower skills or lack understanding of the main objective. the problem with this is your mmr value is penalised due to mmr only being awarded for a match win (so regardless of how well you do personally). the devs solution to this is not to fix match making but to hide the mmr value from almost everywhere, with the last remaining mention of it earmarked for removal if/when ranked play is finally introduced.furthermore the matchmaking has been bust since players were able to group and raise their mmr by often queuing against solo players. there is no option as a solo player to opt out of being stomped by a team on a rd party voip that has a team coordination advantage. a solution to this was introduced to split groups during balancing if the team mmr disparity was above a certain threshold but this has subsequently been removed. the shrinking of maps dumbed down the strategy in the game and increased the death match style it currently has with very short respawn times based on level rather than personal death rate. other changes such as opening up a path to your base if you loose a gamma fight further dumbed down the game as it made the match almost entirely about the outcome of gamma .there are so few players that the queue times for a match are insane, i'm talking around an hour or more waiting for a match in what is known as the bracket player pool. this is the case even though over thirds of the previous days highest concurrent player count are ingame.expect ai bots in pvp until you reach bracket too.still no voip service available in game and the next most pressing feature to be added is the addition of a new in game store, eh yeah go figure the priorities...edit: you also aren't given the choice of what game mode you wish to play within pvp so if you don't like the frontline mode it's tough because you can be placed into either frontline or conquest. another bizare decision as both modes require the same number of players. it's like they deliberatly think of ways to cheese off the playerbase.since the current experience is beyond frustrating i can't recommend it with the problems it has.",0

885,"the takeaway: fractured space has qutie a lot of good potential. the graphics are great thanks to the ut engine. the gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing moba archetypes. i felt that there's enough promise to put my $ usd on the table after playing just a few matches. it's like homeworld, world of tanks, and lol/dota/hots had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.the good: amazing graphics for a moba title fresh gameplay for the genre intuitive, easy to master controls unique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don't care, but for me that's a huge thing) the bad: horrible lag issues. (i'm used to some lag, but i've had a few matches where i would jump large distances from where i was or where i intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites. no tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. there needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (move next to the point to capture and so on. something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). i've managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn't readily apparent even after reading the in-game how to play primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an mtg card. there's nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn't know you could upgrate your ship's systems you'll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship. however there is one big caveat i'll give to my little bit of whining above. i didn't bother to read any of the how to play stuff outside of the control scheme for my first matches.",1

4613,"this game has its pros and its cons. having + hours invested in this game, i can make a little analysis.most of this analysis will be based on the game mode conquest because that is the ompetitive, premier game mode. first of all, no you cannot transition from league of legends to this game. the two games have separate metas to each game. while it is also a moba, it is not a game that you can pick up. that being said, this is not an easy game. you will have to have a grasp of over gods and their kits, and learn there pros and cons and matchups against other characters. secondly, it will take a while to face people that know what they're doing. before they introduced the new leveling system, the maximum level was level . if you were not level , people would call out things like it was league of legends instead of understanding the choices in lanes were relative and you must pick solo lane or duo lane instead of left or right. people will blame you for not being there for them when they were too aggressive and you wanted to cut the losses and steal something from them. people just don't fully grasp the game and what they're doing wrong. it will be frustrating for a little while due to the leveling issues.then you hit a certain level where the entire game changes. it used to be about games into level , but now it's different.but once you hit a certain level, the game will choose to test your skills against higher skilled people. people will gank you and be aggressive. they will be smart and group up to steal objectives and gank you. at that point, you will have to commumicate will your teammates and defend what is yours or counter steal another objective or tower. and, for the most part, no matter behind you are in levels and gold, you are never completely out of the fight. as the game goes on respawn timers get longer and you are able to catch up by taking objectives and towers that cold completely turn the game around, and all it takes is a misplay. the long games are some of the most rewarding experiences or biggest heartbreaks in almost any game i've played.the conquest game mode has been up and down since the middle of season and through season . i personally barely played season , just played enough ranked to get into diamond again. with how the map has been revamped, it feels the most engaging and exciting season i've played.the neat thing about this game is that you can get all the gods and future gods for $, and sometimes -$ on sales. the game is very accessible taht way. however, they get there money from loot chests that you have to spend on gems, which you either get from logging on every day, getting up to per week or buying them. all of the good skins are in a pool oftier trash to pretty cool skins. the chests have a set limit on what is in them, ususally ranging at - skins or boosters and misc. they claim that the skins are all randomized and not in a set order, but all the good skins end up to come up when youre at the very end of the list. i encourage people to get coolskins because they do put a lot of effort into them and that's where their creativity comes out. but just keep that in mind when you are planning to buy a chest to get skins.",1
4321,"this is, first and foremost, a mobile game ported to steam. is that a bad thing? maybe. the thing is that how much you spend is up to you, but if you want to get your favorite individual cards, you better hope they are rare or normal, and not put in the abritrary packs/rewards. while the game gives free currency to get packs frequently, it only happens with events that give it away in big lumps, else you're getting trickles of gems.second, the game plays like pre-ds era yu-gi-oh, with a smaller field to make games faster. this is both a strength and weekness for the game, as while this brings in vets of the game, it can turn away more meta players/players who's favorite card/archtype is not in the game.third, this game is very competitive at times, and trys to subtlely nudge you into paying with the vegabond duelest, who are just ghosts of high ranked pvp players, who also duel with sometimes bs modifiers like having a full field or having only cards in your hand. add those modifiers with a good deck and the odds are so stacked against you at times it's like an whale versus a mouse.sure, you can harp on me saying i only have < hrs on the game, but it's a game that discurages playing for long without paying. and while i don't mind having cards from post-gx, if you're gonna port an archtype, port an archtype that fits within classic/gx era, not archtypes that have good syncros/xyz/pendulum monsters.",0

4192,"if you played and/or play the normal yu-gi-oh card game, i do not recommend this. its a sad immitation. don't get me wrong its oddly enjoyable, i mean i put in hours into it, and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then minutes, but its not something i can take seriously.cons:first, they cut the game in half, which means, half the deck size, half the hp, half the time, and half the cards on the field. biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that, so that means you have cards the ask for hp and combo cards like exodia that are useless.the game forces you through a progression system, that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction. i understand explaining a game to someone, but anything bellow level is no challenge at all, and thats with a halfdeck. to give example of how bad it is, level and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss, and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long. the ai is super simple. now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage to even play against players. just to clarify what i mean by no challenge, is the enemy does not place spell or trap, and nothing above crappy regular stars, which can be easily out done with one of your first cards.last thing i have to say, is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical chinese knockoff, they put in a attempt, tried to cut corners, and it turned out likepros(yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it):matches are fast, so you can enjoy a few during a break.its more portable, so yu-gi-oh on the go.less money to get a insane amount of cards.good way to try new cards, and card combos.they implement a auto-duel feature, making the boring duels shorter, more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck.voice actors from the anime.",0

3656,"currently the game is awful. it lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. quickplay is gone. it's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called casual. it's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. dosn't help that the queue times are god awful as well. i managed to watch entire sgbplay mario party videos, which are about : hours long each, before entering a single match of badwater that lasted about minutes. and in those minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of morgan freeman, or the team hoovy/spycrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. hell, even the lenny/bind spammers are gone. this simple move has taken all the character and charm tf had andall over it.next is the balancing. this game has horrible balancing. especially since valve doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. only listening to the competitive players. people like bnny and mr.slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by valve, and to what has that opinion led? phlog buff of smissmass and caber nerf of summer . two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the phlog became the walk and die weapon of the century. this update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. come on, who was complaining about the buffalo steak sandvich!? who complained enough to say it needed a nerf!? next is the communication. valve communicating with the community, what a pipedream. they never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. at most we get the ocassional neato in the sub-reddit. and why you might ask? because the tf team is people who don't care/give aabout their own game. overwatch was released, one would expect valve to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with heavy vs pyro, which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. if valve simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. most of the tf community would be happy knowing that valve didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. and finally, my biggest gripe with tf currently, it's more personal and i know i'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of mac support. i run tf on mac, which some might call , but at least i run tf at fps. well would run it. the game is in such a state where the mac support died off about months ago. the game constantly crashes with the error out of memory or because the game failed to load a single texture. not to mention the game loads textures one at a time. for mac users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. so for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to hours on fort alone. also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the retriving server info part of the loading screen. i'm not sure if windows/linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the mac to crash in some way or another. there's even been instances where my entire computer, not just tf, but all of it crashed due to tf failing to load me in. the last true patch mac ever got was about year ago in gun mettle, where valve did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? this is a tf only issue, gmod runs fine, cs:go runs fine, but tf doesn't. the game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. doesn't even feel valve is the one making the game anymore. it feels like ea or god-fobid ubisoft took the wheel with this game.",0

6361,"heroes and generals is now out of early access, so lets take a look!excellent foundation, good technical achievements, incredibly poor design choices and missing management.that about sums it up. but lets elaborate on that.the foundation of the game- the battles themselves as infantryman are good. vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal. the physics and gun system are good, once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game, and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs. but then there are things missing, and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for. prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective, and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point.flanking works well, you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms, but this is not really used that much. you can use it all, be the ultimate soldier, and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets. there is no penalty for dying- not for you at least, but more on that later, and you don't really get rewarded for anything you do either. you play to play, and you win because you want to win.then lets get right to the poor design choices. this game is not just pay to win, but pay to progress. the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game. do you want to group up with a few friends? if there's more than two, then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the 'skill' of having a group. after that, prepare for a lot more grind, as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier. and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades, you're going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications, because every single bullet shot, grenade thrown, mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot. this leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentality;life is cheap. ammo is expensive.if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because times out of it will be better than yours, even if you've spend + hours on the game.of course there are other issues, mainly around balance and the 'generals' portion of the game. i'll spare you the complaints on balance- it's the usual for pay to win games, but more on that other bit later.that said, if you don't mind the grind, and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours(+) the basic infantry combat is good stuff. moving along to tanks you will find that they're not amazing, but certainly entertaining and useful. your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well. airplanes are a joke and they likely always will be, do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them. controls are awful, planes don't do anything, and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful. prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything.and then on to the big complaint with this game, when you're not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money. the generals part.it may as well not exist.the game may even be better if it did not exist.the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable.first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it. then you will need to spend + days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them. they will die in about minutes and they will have gained no experience. everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the devs money for it, which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them. the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy- merely people throwing their units around hoping it works. sometimes it does work too, but this is never because of any skill at command.it all comes down to the people playing the war battles. and they don't care. people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at. because they don't have to pay for those tanks. the guy who got the tank brigade does. same for airplanes, infantry spawns and vehicles. why would they care that you've waited days to get your infantry squad filled? they will run into machinegun fire and then respawn to do it again until you lose your squad. they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have infantry spawns and vehicle spawns and they fight infantry and vehicles. and because these vehicles despawn after use, they are gone and they remain gone. the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics, a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game.and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun. a game with great ideas, pretty good technical achievements, but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesn't care either. greed above all else, and a complete lack of awareness.long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept, good basic gameplay, and claimed to have plans to make it better. i wanted to support them, since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great.i regret that.i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use. the game isn't better than it was back then. it's worse, and it's showing no signs of ever improving.",0

15739,"i played the opening section of the game and it was okay but i had a few problems. the sprite work: the sprite work isn't necessarally bad, the problem is when artix went fron d to d the sprite work wasn't up to par with their other games the sprites weren't phenomonal in their d games either but the quality degrated when the game went into d. if artix patches the game and the sprites weren't so blocky then i would have no issue. the controls: the controls in the game seemed rather awkward because rather than making the camera move with the mouse (it does but you need to click and hold as apposed to just moving the mouse one direction or another) they have the camera moving with the a and d keys so you can't strafe out of the way of an attack which isn't game breaking but it is rather bothersome when it comes to games of this nature. the controls would be better if the game stayed a point and click movement game (like aq worlds for example) or if they went with the mouse controling all of the camera and the wasd keys being just for movement.. attacking/fighting: it isn't an issue but it would function better if the games attacks weren't set to the numbers, i get that it isn't easy designing a game and i may have higher expectations than others who play this game but it is a bit awkward using the arrow keys and the numbers at the same time and i do know that i could just use the number pad but that is awkward when i am using the mouse to change the angle and i get that the mouse isn't necessary at all but if you are going to say in the tutorial that i need to use the mouse but i really don't thats a little misleading when you first start a game. now i'm sure that this game has loads to offer but i just can't deal with the issue with the controls and fighting issue, the sprites are an issue of i know that artix can do better because they have done better i would love to see this game become huge and have millions of players but right now i can't be apart of that because of these issues.",0

4082,"it's time to duel! yu-gi-oh! duel links is a mobile game that was port to pc. it reminded me of the nostalgia when i was playing with their trading cards using the original playing mat. luckily, konami decided to simplify the game by decreasing it from the original game to just three spaces per monster and spell/trap cards. the minimization, as well as the automated duel options, is an excellent investment to play the game while saving time. most of the time auto duel will result in wins when battling npc duelist under level . above level , it's better to duel manually. additionally, auto duel does have a problem with unique decks, but as long as you use a standard deck, auto duel will usually get things right. yu-gi-oh! duel links is very addicting, and it can be a timesink. it has a feeling of one more turn where you would like to continue playing the game on and on. nevertheless, there is a limit to the number of npc duelist available at any set times, so it provides a way to limit players being glued to playing this game. multiplayer is satisfactory, but since each players' decks are different, there are numerous strategies to use to win a duel.games like yu-gi-oh! duel links are best suited for on-the-go gaming. there's a lack of stories and any essential backdrop to what you are trying to achieve in-game, but dueling to be the king of games will be sufficient for most users. i recommend that you try it out on pc, but if you planned to play long term, it's best to stick to the mobile version.",1

3693,"team fortress (tf) is one the games that you really have to try, it is free to play (fp) and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter (fps) style. unlike most fps that is played competitively, it focuses more on fun and especially humor. tf has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats (yes you read it right, hats!).gameplaytf is fun yet a challenging game, it has a rich gameplay and a huge community. it is composed of two opposing factions represented by the name of these companies, the reliable excavation & demolition (red) and builders league united (blu) which are mercenaries hired by two opposing brothers. players can choose any classes, characters and the side they represent to compete against the opposing team through certain missions/objectives per game mode. gamemodes:unlike most fps games, tf has a lot of good game modes, every game mode has a different and unique play style which makes the game interesting. other game modes are still in beta stage thus small bugs might occur but overall it has a decent maps, objectives and team play. here's a list of game modes and its respective mission/objective:capture the flag - each team has their own intelligence briefcases that they have to protect from the opposing team, the main objective is to capture enemy's intelligence until they reach the game's capture limit.control point - game mode based on control points where you capture enemy points and protect each point from being captured.territorial control - game mode based on point to point where you must capture the enemy point and defend yours, points gets randomly selected in a different place to protect or to capture.payload - a series of checkpoints where you have to get the cart to the final point while the enemies tries to stop you.arena - a tactical mode whereas teams fight under pressure in a smaller maps for shorter matches. a control point is found at the center of the map, where you have to capture without being killed.king of the hill - like the arena, it focuses on a single control point where you have to capture till minutes or defend the point before the enemy takes full control of the point. payload race - each team will be given a cart for teams to push and compete and defend the point against the other team.medieval mode - there will be a number of points like the control point but both teams can only choose from a set list of allowed weapons.special delivery - a unique game mode where both teams must capture a neutral briefcase, the team who takes it first must bring it to a specified area of the map while the opposing team must stop them defending the area. once the briefcase drops, enemy team can't take it but rather defend the briefcase from being taken.mann vs. machine - another unique game mode where a team of three or six player must defend the mann co's strongholds from a wave of raging robots that carries a bomb. robot destruction - a beta map where teams must destroy the opposing team's robots and collect the power cores to earn points. after gaining points, a reactor core appears that can be stolen by the opposing team.mannpower - teams must capture the enemy's intelligence briefcase while adding a twist in game with grappling hooks and unique power-ups.pass time - another beta map that has a football like game play. team must take hold of the jack to throw it to the opposing team's goal.player destruction - a game mode created by the community where players must collect bottles of beer from killed enemies and jumping to the ufo after. once a player gets killed they will drop their held beers that can be taken by both teams.the best map for beginners would be king of the hill, its simple yet fun. classes and characters:most fps games focuses more on weapons and less on characters, in tf you can get to choose different characters with unique roles and special abilities. the game is created to have fun thus expect a unique approach on certain abilities. here's a list of classes and characters with their respective roles and characteristics:offense (good for veterans)scout - a fast and agile character that can capture and pushes cart faster than any characters, has a special ability that can jump twice in mid air. equipped with scatter gun, pistol and a baseball bat.soldier - slower but durable character that uses a rocket launcher, shotgun and a shovel. he can use his rocket launcher to launch himself into the air (not into the outer space) with the cost of his health for a better aiming with style (seems ironic).pyro - a pyromaniac that uses flamethrower, fire axe and a shotgun, they can blast it to an ally to extinguish fire or use it to an enemy to gain distance.defense (good for advanced players)demoman - a character that uses explosives to defend an area. equipped with grenade, sticky bomb and a bottle.heavy - slow but can sustain and deal a huge amount of damage. equipped with an enormous mini-gun, a shotgun and its own fist to strike.engineer - a character that can build and destroy machines capable of defending with sentry gun, a teleport machine and a health and ammo dispenser. equipped with a shotgun, a pistol and a wrench. support (good for beginners) medic - a doctor that his main role is to heal his allies, healing allies can grant bercharge that can boost him and his healed ally. equipped with medi gun, syringe and a bonesaw.sniper - a sniper that can kill enemies with one shot from afar. equips with a sniper rifle (what would you expect, a laser beam?), a submachine gun and a kukri (a starter pack good for campers).spy - a character that sneaks into the enemy's back and strikes with a knife, has a special ability that can turn himself invisible to the enemies eyes and can destroy machines easily. equipped with a pistol, a watch that can make himself invisible, an elctronic sapper that can take down machines easily, a device hidden in a cigarette case that cloak himself into an enemy character, a revolver and a butterfly knife or balisong (originated from the philippines) that can kill with one stab if used properly. (absolutely not for newbies) classes, characters and team can be changed while the game is in progress. this can be done by pressing , (comma) to change class and character and by pressing . (period) to change team.controlsjust like most fps games, tf uses the standard keyboard set-up which is the basic wasd (forward, move left, backward and move right) movement, r to reload, q for last weapon used and etc. mouse is used to aim (point), shoot (left-click), use every character's special skill (right-click) and to change weapon (mouse wheel up or down). the controls are smooth and comfortable, weapons can be changed through the keyboard with keys: , and /, and or through the mouse button by scrolling up or down. prosartistic character designfree and easy to playup to different classes and different characters to choose fromhumorous and fun without pressuregood reward systemconsnew players might find this game challengingyou might get bored after some timeconclusionthe game is good to have fun and to kill some time but with more fps games coming around its hard to keep up. i recommend this game for non competitive ones and for those who just want to play a good fp fps game, it has smooth and comfortable controls with decent character model and animation. overall, this game is unique and better than any other fps games, it has a strong game play and outstanding maps but if you are into a more competitive side, this game is simply not for you but absolutely worth the try.",1

6610,"i've put many months into this game both here on steam and on the browser variant back before they had a steam option, and i won't lie. this game was (key word there *was* ) pretty decent. i enjoyed the strengths each faction posessed, how each fight was based upon the steadfast response of the generals and how quickly the soldiers (players) could react to a confrontation especially in a -front war zone. battles would last many hours, and you'd make a ton of money in the war mode. tanks were difficult to deal with due to the very few ways you could actually take care of it, planes could change the outcome of a war with a well-placed/timed bomb, snipers consistently moved after kills and kept enemy troops on high alert. and the two-front spawn protection (spawning on the point or if it was being taken you spawn around the outer edges, all of which with an invisibility protection until your first shot/ feet movement.) helped keep the battles continuous and fairly balanced even in a tough situation when outnumbered or people attempting to spawn trap instead of capping the point...but then came the plague that is reto as they do with every patch in the name of fun. originally all three factions were to get their own anti tank rifles, this was a highlight for me! i love the idea of having a fair shot as a soldier to fight armor if you're smart about where you put your shots... well.. that was years ago or just about at this point. the only faction of those to get an at rifle is the russians with ptrd's. things then began to steadily become more... aggrivatingly skewed, from fixing lmg's to have severe conical spread almost right out of the barrel, to their recent changes that force players to purchase generals instead of career changing to them [unless that's just a bug but i'm not entirely sure of that]... the long version the war [generals] tab gives the losing factions an underdog bonsus... or well, it's supposed to. in the past few months the bonus has become forever hooked to the u.s.s.r. [this most recent being a % bonus to their faction even when they were in first place for the last several days.]sure, perhaps it's just a glitch in the scripting i'll accept that. it's just a buffer afterall, don't get much out of war except better income for your efforts... but then come the more notable skews.the most notorious being the yak-'s. unload multiple clips of an aa gun or p / bf into it, it remains alive. yet get shot by it as a p- or bf-, and you're chopped down in seconds, and its bombs reach several meters further than either of the other two planes (by almost feet).the second being the simple fact that the russian playerbase are rather arrogant and extensively hate-based against anyone who doesn't use the russian faction, and will enter others' factions just to hate on them. this ends up causing a domino effect which gets the butt-hurt individuals in the other factions to start going around doing the same, which ends up being a giant rage-fest instead of gaming.third one being the skew in at methods... while this has recently been fixed (i use the term loosely) by giving the u.s sticky-grenades and (much later) the lawn-dart grenades for the germans, the u.s.s.r have rpg grenades, once again having had them far longer than any other faction and giving them extensive bonuses due to the fact that they can break through near triple the amount of armor compared to the others. ( stickies to kill a light tank, rpg-'s to kill a medium... lawn darts to kill a light. lawn darts being far more expensive than the other two.)paratroopers primarily based on the u.s get a carbine, which wouldn't be extensively agitating if it wasn't for the fact it can get so ridiculously powerful and accurate at range that it puts the k, mosin and m to shame. [and fyi, reto... bowl shaped parachutes were not controllable in ww. having someone able to avoid quad- cal aa gun fire just by spazzing a and d rapidly is stupidly aggrivating, especially when paratroopers are dropping on one point and can land on the *same roof* when dropping from almost + meters seperation on dropping from the plane.]then comes the most recent rage. the pontoon-vehicle introduction. getting those vehicles was awesome. don't get me wrong. but to suddenly have russia with the *only* water-capable tank, and the *only* water-capable jeep that can use an mg mount on it, is far from showing a desire for fun in the game as you so callously flaunt at our faces. germans and u.s forces were known to use snorkels on their tanks for a reason.the most disgusting thing they've done though, is the spawn change. now you end up being spawn trapped by paratroopers and tanks more than you do getting shot by actual combatants. not only this, but if you lose the point while you're fighting *they take your gun away* because you're suddenly in an enemy spawn zone! this leaves you completely incapable of guarding yourself while you try to get away! giving them a free kill! on top of this, due to the spawns being pre-determined in - locations *per mark* you will not be able to avoid spawn killers. the moment you're spotted, you're screwed. also, when you end up being at your last point, you end up getting spawned several hundred yards away! so if you're the only one left defending (which happens alot) you end up running over there just to realize you're too late.in recent updates their camera has been freaking out extensively, primarily when prone on a hill or small incline/descent. this leads to your character looking like it's jerking off extensively, especially when you're trying to aim, which ends with death to you due to being unable to even fire unless you stand or crouch.tldr for those who can't read a player's rant aka the short version...: ) underdog bonus is bugged to the russian's benefit and has been for several months... could just be a bug, doubt it though.) russian players are irritating rats who don't like to lose and will enter others' factions just to rage at them in the war chats [which leads to flame wars in the chats in various languages on all factions and in support chat]) at weaponry is extensively out-performed where it actually counts. russians seem to be in the lead as far as damage capability.)) paratroopers, especially u.s, are extensively abused to spawn kill using their m carbines since they only use equip slots.) water-capable vehicles are awesome! russia having the only water-capable tank and jeep able to carry a gun? not so much) spawn change sucks balls, and has destroyed the ability of defending troops to actually do much on the matter.) laying/going prone on a hill is a bad idea. your camera spazzes out, and they refuse to listen when you send in a ticket about these issues. even when given video evidence of it happening on anything less than flat ground. (recent patch has fixed this issue.)final outcomegame: /developers: -/you want a game to pass the time, this'll work. everything is acquirable free of charge, even premium time! it's just a very long grind. but be warned you will rage at some point for one reason or another. don't play war without a squad of at least people. and don't expect a team to work as a team.their help desk, ticket support and reporting system are crap as well. don't expect help when you need it, and don't expect much to happen when someone starts flipping off in the support channel/faction chats/global chats and so forth. at least they fixed the player search function next to the chat to actually see all the players in the chat, albeit it resets your search when someone new enters, which makes it just as worthless as it was. so don't expect to be able to block/ignore them unless you see them in-game.update //: no differences. still broken bias.",0

7968,"enjoyable in short bursts for a long time, i stopped playing nw because it was an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic werent all that interested in fixing it. ive returned after more than six months to nw and i gotta say its a pretty fun fp mmo, taken in small doses. the combat is fast paced and satisfying, plus after a longtime the game is finally optimized and you can properly enjoy it (it should run at -fps on most pcs even in more crowded areas).although its based on the forgotten realms d&d setting, this game is nothing like its tabletop counterpart (or neverwinter nights for that matter). nw is an action mmo through and through, your characters have no alignment to speak of, so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world (except for the fact that some races work better for some classes). the voice acting is decent, the music is pretty good, graphics are acceptable (better than most fp mmos on the market), just dont go into this game expecting the next big thing.if you are not willing to spend any money on this game, then i would suggest you stay away from pvp. as a non-paying player you wont be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop items that make your life much easier (or those who have played aton). as a side note, you are able to convert astral diamonds (a currency you get from different in-game activities) into zen (the premium currency, that can also be bought with your hard earned $) to buy stuff from the cash shop, but the rates arent all that great.another problem for free players is that we are limited to character slots per account, which is kinda  and the only way to get more is with zen (on the other hand, you can make and use as many free accounts as you like). whats more, races are locked behind game packs that go for ,  for the moon elf, ,  for the dragonborn and ,  for the menzoberranzan renegade (the packs also include some mounts, a char slot each and some otherthats not all that useful).as for pve, its pretty entertaining, albeit repetitive. once you hit max lvl, your main goals are to obtain some artifacts and do the campaigns (which mostly consist of doing daily quests, getting some resources which youll use to research some passive skills for your character). the quests you do arent all that memorable, but at least they arent very long, so you wont have to spend too much time with em. recently theyve also introduced a system that makes the campaigns faster for an alt but i havent spent much time with it so i cant say how much faster they really are.all in all, if you can look past its flaws (which are quite a few), nw is a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly killing monsters and grinding some gear.",1

8814,"i believe that this game has a tooon of potential, especially to outweigh some of the other competition. the fact that this is on steam, where many people heavily rely upon to play the majority of their games, the chances of someone trying out the game increase tremendously. in addition, it'll be much easier for the developers to get purchases of battle passes and whatever else they may add, due to the fact that the steam wallet is much more flexible, as people are more likely to have leftover money after purchasing other games or items on steam.this is my list of pros and cons during early access, specifically alpha. pros gameplay pros clean ui, easy to understand symbols balanced classes (for the most part, and also from what i can tell) marked points on the minimap show up as transparent pillars in the map, very useful at all stages of the game a different style of dropping, no parachuting which is a nice touch for the pace of the game dispersion of chests/loot is nice, as you won't find things too close or too far away from each other variety of weapon choices class specific weapons & abilities (if you kill another player, you will not be able to use their stuff if it is class specific) tiers of weapons/armor (common, uncommon, rare, etc.) forging is very unique, allows for gameplay to be more in-depth toggleable mount/vehicle for longer distance travel (i like how it disables when you go indoors, as well as the cooldown) damage indicators pretty good hit-registration for its first week of play map pros very detailed map, with different biomes, like an ice one, forest, desert, etc. in the four corners graphics are pretty nice for a free game topography is shown, which is super cool (lets you know how elevated a surface is, so you can know if one spot is a mountain or not, etc.) labels for places in the map, as well as specifics (where every forge in the map is, and block coordinates [a, a, b, b, etc.]) other pros region selection for matchmaking not pay-to-win party finder for those who do not just want to fill lobby customizable options for crosshair reticles, audio, video, etc. controller support for those who would like a challenge i guess haha player rating (does not affect matchmaking queue as of now, however i would like there to be a list of ranks so we know how we're rated) report feature voice chat (i personally haven't used it that much, but it seems fine) the horse is very buff and the chicken is awesome :d cons gameplay cons limited inventory to two weapons, (the three max abilities is entirely fine) no indication of weapon statistics after picking up (when opening your inventory, the only option is to swap its slot from one or two) is now in the game! no indication of the flight path before dropping no manually reviving teammates (the chicken mechanic is nice, but not always ideal) sound cues are not always accurate or loud enough, this goes for me as well as a couple of my other friends who all have different headsets (turtle beach, logitech, razer, etc.) when opening chests, potions and other items may appear stuck inside of it, which makes it tricky to find an angle that lets you pick it up. auto pickup when running over it now! unable to drop potions you can drop them with ease now only third person (/, sometimes these royales are better or worse with only tp, i am personally fine with both) choppily moving zone, however that's expected from an alpha game map cons minor bugs with the landscape, i've run into a couple floating bushes or things didn't render properly (uncommon though, also note that i have the highest graphics settings) no current zoom mechanic on minimap other cons no current q&a, or common questions people may have regarding mechanics, may lead to confusion or people to believe something that is false (such as the chicken thing, and disenchanting) q&a/basics as well as patch notes in-game, good stuff. model stiffness, sometimes the animations just stop and the character goes into the gmod t-pose fixed now no colorblind mode yet, which would be extremely helpful for people like me who have difficulties differentiating the colored tiers of items tabbing out can take some time, occasionally crashing the game, not sure how often this will occurtaking all of this into consideration, the game seems to be going in a pretty good direction. i hope that the developers are very responsive throughout development, and later in the game's progress. i personally am not a huge fan of battle royales, i tend to play them more casually, however, i expect this game to be pulling in some more of my hours.overall, this game is a /, and you should definietely consider trying it out, especially since it is free!",1

5726,"dcs world is a great hardcore combat flight sim with a crazy amount of detail and i love it for that but something about the game doesn't feel the same as il- or strike fighters . i think it comes down to a few things with me. : content is lacking. compaired to il- and sf the game feels a little barebones with its selection of aircraft. yes the detail is much higher in dcs but i would rather see eagle dynamics come out with more playable aircraft if it means dropping the detail to that of fc.: no middle ground. its full sim or nothing in dcs and thats fine but tbh i like the way il- and sf handle sims and having the option just to set things as easy or as hard as i want. (sometimes i just want to blow s*** up) without going though the hassel. : mod support. this leads back to the issue of not having a wide selection of aircraft in dcs and its far from having any type of mod library that gets close to il- or sf: price of dlc. now i'm no stranger to paying for dlc on a simulator (god knows i spent a lot in train simulator) but thats the thing. for me it comes down to why pay when i can get a mod for sf? if they lowered the cost i wouldn't mind picking put more then what i have but at $ i find it hard to justify getting one.dcs world is a great sim, but is it on my favorites list? no, it doesn't have the aircraft i like and it doesn't give me the same joy and gameplay experience that i look for in a sim. /",1

11900,"from the perspective of someone that has played the game on every server so far, including the rebuild servers as well, so yes there is bias. yes there will be blind fanboyism. but i will do what i can to keep this as transparent as possible.yes, i am % aware we received a client that still had dupes, bugs, and glitches from a previous version and i can not let that slide past the review that they blatantly didn't care enough to fix that before launch. do i know why? no. and neither do you honestly so stop creating the idea of lazy company. wants game to fail. they spent over a literal ton of money to port the game over to the western servers and they are not going to sit by and let the game crash, or at least if they are smart they wouldn't haha. the game had launch problems... what game hasn't? more closely, what mmorpg hasn't? especially kmmorpgs. hell we can look at american made games too, it isn't just the asian mmorpg market. you know that really big mmorpg that everyone is hoping the next mmorpg kills. that wow game that every mmorpg is compared to. i know a lot of you are probably too young or just didn't play computer games then. but that launch? much worse than this game. hell we can come to a more recent date even. anyone play wow wod launch? the servers were down for a week for their more populated servers, so educate yourself before saying the server stability for this launch was bad. that can be drawn to many reasons but people aren't arguing the reason. they are only arguing that it happened. this is one of the smoother launches for mmorpgs that i've every experienced. now could it have been smoother? yes. they ed up thinking that their servers could hold that many people all logging in at the same exact time into the game. they should have started with + servers and then cut them down as time went on or something along those lines to make it smoother and keep a nicer image of their company. but they didn't and it made them look lazy and stupid. i won't back them up or say people are wrong, the servers werethe first - days but they have fixed a lot of the issues revolving around with not being able to even play the game, so just give it time as far as optimization is concerned. if that's why you left and refunded or if that's what is keeping you from getting the game then don't get the game. wait. if you really want to play it but are scared of that, just keep up to date with the game. stay active in the reddit, read reviews. formulate your own opinion based on the game from the reviews. see if the negatives outweigh the positives you're concerned about.now to the point of making your own opinion. there have been a lot of videos from youtube content creators constantly bashing and destroying everything about this game, names like cryy, lolhero, lazypeon, gaming lighthouse and many more i'm sure. they are given the right to feel how they want about the game and for the most part, every point that each of these videos made was % accurate, i won't discredit them. they got to where they are now for being pretty transparent, but just remember. they aren't you. yes this game has flaws, and yes it has too many issues that we should not be okay with in . but look through all of the information presented to you, don't copy opinions based on what one person you've watched for years says. my friends (that have never played the game before, all from wow) all got the game early access. they saw those videos and guess what. they still play the game, because while those videos had a lot of truth behind them, my friends still enjoy the game. yes it has flaws. but it can still be enjoyable if you focus on having fun and not on attacking every negativity. now maybe you do that and still don't like the game. then walk away, refund it and you're good. don't come back, don't constantly keep going back totalk the people that are enjoying the game. you only make yourself look like an even if you feel the need to voice your opinion, it really isn't needed. be happy with your money back and enjoy life, don't stress over a game you already quit. lol.apart from the rant, obviously there is still blind fanboyism and with reason. i absolutely enjoy playing this game. the leveling is fun to me and has been on every re-iteration of the game. the taming system is addicting. the crafting system is an easy but fun grind. gathering to max level gathering is addicting. i actually feel like i'm going somewhere everytime i get a drop unlike bdo. i played bdo for a significant amount of time and yes getting that one boss drop was exciting. but short lived excitement... i never felt stronger until i spent months grinding the item out to tri. this game has a different gear system so it isn't a fair comparison, i'm more comparing the feeling of gearing, i actually feel like i'm getting stronger everytime i get a drop. going form green to blue. from one blue drop to the next always makes me feel like i'm progressing and i'm not even +ing the gear yet. tl;dr ... yes the game has flaws but it can still be fun. give it time to get better or play now. your decision. i love the game and i'm going to continue to play it. :d",1
7156,"the elder scroll legends game steals shamelessly from hearthstone, and this makes it a good game. where it is unique from hearthstone it is gimmicky, but those places are few and far between. the pros:if you play hearthstone, you already know how to play, how to get around, and how to win.it is shiny and beautiful, with better voice acting than the aaa elderscrolls games (i know, not saying much)it has more modes and game types than hearthstone. the most important pro to me: it is still a manageable size. i left hearthstone behind because it was a bloated complicated mess with more content dumped on top weekly. this is currently a great size, and as a new game, there is less of a pro userbase to kick me down. ()the cons:the ai, although fun to play, is fairly weak. it makes clumsy decisions frequently. it steals almost everything from heathstone, and comes across as an amature effort because of that. i mean it steals... everything. there is a heavy imbalance towards going second. the triple gem ring keeps you tight on curve and makes it hard to lose.we shall see! i am hours in, and i don't even have that much time for games any more.",1

10718,"i wish the reviews had a neutral option. the game has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be the top ccg. it by far has the best single player & ai of any game in the genre. there is a very fun and free single player mode vs the ai that gives you lots of cards / gold. they are very generous and make the collection building much easier than other games. the ranked system is actually very well done. you need points to rank up and every win gives you some points and a loss takes some away. you gain more points for wins than points loss for losing. i have a few key issues with this game which is the main reason i only really play to do daily quest now and instead play elder scrolls legends with most of my time. elder scrolls legends is by far the bes ccg available and it's a shame nobody has heard of. it's kind of funny that dire wolf is also doing elder scrolls, but yet that game blows away eternal. anyway, let's get into the actual problem. the decks are just too large with cards, but they do allow for up to copies of each card. carrying copies of each with cards is not the same as having a card deck with copies of each. your extra copies or even all of the copies of card can and often do end up in the latter /rds of the deck which never see play. there are just too many total cards to be able to have very consistent gameplay. i have spent a little over half of my time playing ranked matches and i have had only a couple of games that actually felt like good solid games on both sides. just for a comparison, elder scrolls has almost every game feel like a good close game with the winner being determined based on skill more than rng. the other % of games were just blowout wins or losses. too often the game is decided in the opening hand. whoever wins or loses is more often a question of which player gets a better distribution of their sigils rather than who actually played better or had a better constructed deck.you put cards into the deck and then you are forced to put at least sigil cards. if you want to play a cost unit then you must first play sigil. to play a cost unit requires you to have played total sigils and you can only play sigil per turn. in theory this is a good idea, but their system needs some serious tweaking to make the gameplay feel balanced. % of the games end with + cards left into the deck. too often you will have cards in your hand, but then can't play them because you draw a sigil for turns in a row. the other thing that happens is that you only draw minions / spells, but no sigils. i hate winning a game for no reason other than my opponent drew sigils for straight turns while i bashed his face in. i also equally hate losing for this same reason. the mulligan system will allow you to either keep or replace all of your cards which does not help these things from happening. if the developers will fix the sigil issue and cut the size of the deck by about cards then would be a perfect game. the way the game is right now i would recommend it if you like magic as it's really close in gameplay or hate the other ccgs you're currently playing. you would be better off checking out elder scrolls legends because until this game is more balanced, esl is just a better game all around.",1

9767,"it makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win. there is nothing in this game that you have to buy. there are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. i've been playing this game since back when there were only classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. the items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. there are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier pve experience. the only thing that i can say is a usual must pay is the second b slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $ other than that you don't have to buy anything, i've never expanded my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy. now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines d side scrolling with d elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. each character currently in the game has jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. all and all the games pve is superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. now for the pvp, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. it comes in the form of v, v, v, and a base race game mode. where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. the biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in pve where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. overall i believe that this is a great mmo that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.",1

10527,"thehunter - this review is designed to eliminate the stress of playing without knowledge of the game from first hand encounters.lets get this out of the way first.q: what is thehunter?a: thehunter is not just a game its a hunting simulation. yes a simulation.w: if you want to run around and shoot whatever moves, this is not the game for you. if your looking for freebies and handouts, this is not the game for you. if you want free stuff then you need to earn it. if you are a kid, and momma wont buy you anything, then this is not the game for you. if your stingy and dont want to spend a few bucks go back to wow and waste ur life. lastly, playing the game is free, and you can play as much as you like. if you want to play more than what you start with, then get a bundle package. (more details below)q: does it cost anything to play?a: no!h: however, the developers have made the game available to you for free. this is not a free trial. it is the complete game. you can hunt species right from the start as long as you want forever. their business model is genius, if you like what you see and want more you can pay them for it.q: what does it cost if i want more?a: well it depends. the bundle deals are probably a steal on our part, their pricing is ultra low. avgs - dollars per month for unlimited access to the game(kill anything). memberships are based on -- month packages. their bundles are the same however the perks to a bundle are priceless when compared to manually purchasing them in the shop.o: okay now, the important things to discuss. if you read any negative reviews (several) your more than likely to find its a ripoff its not free devs suck. well truth be told, your all a bunch of idiots. this isnt just a game, it is a simulation. simulation as close to reality as you can get being virtual. the game aspects are what create more playable attractions. ex: competitions, tracking, spotting levels. leaderboards, animal scoring system. personal achievments. etc.if you want to know what the game is like then i will give you the best review i possibly can honestly and in detail. honestly speaking im very dissapointed in the reviews that dont justify their responses. it royally pisses me off.my reviewhunting in its natural form requires patience, and understanding the behavioral patterns of your prey and overall, the ability to learn from your mistakes.from the start (guest non-member)as a guest or non-member you can create single player games and hunt loggers point reserve. here you will find mule deer, whitetail, rabbit, ferral hog, pheasant. guests are authorized to hunt rabbit and mule deer by default. you can continuously hunt them to your hearts content. (one blunder the devs did was make default rifle non compliant with rabbit hunting, whether this was intended or not should be fixed, its a turn off and negative review maker)when you create your game prior to starting you can choose where you want to start on the map, after doing so the game loads etc.. right from the start its very important to realize that the game feels slow and characters are slow. no this is a hunting game, not call of freakin duty. slow and quiet is the game, and probly the most widely contributed negative review aspect. there is no animals to shoot, i run around for hours and cant find anything what a waste if you have seen a review like this then read the following.. the ai in the game are astonishing, they simulate an emense amount of realism in the animals. slow and quiet when you stand up and walk around your a beacon to the world of animals. so crouch and move slow. the animals get spooked by factores. movement, sound, and smell. by default your character is ugly, smells, and loud as ... the game takes time to understand, you need to put in the time to learn terrain the animals, and their patterns. when you start a new game and you go back to the spot you killed that monster buck, chances are they wont be there anymore. the ai is smart, the animals in the game actually avoid overly hunted areas. pathfinding actually changes for the animals. if the devs did this on purpose, then kudos, if not your some lucky mofo's. . i had to put in some long hours to actually figure how to find the animals. it sucked, and i hated it i was one of those rage quitters. then a friend of mine took me on an actual hunt. as a guest you can join multiplayer games and hunt every map/reservere. just be mindful of the liscenses you carry. anyway, what i learned in that single hour of hunting with my friend, forever changed my opinion of this game.. when you play for the first time, expect to get frustrated if you dont actually have real life hunting habits. you will be inclined to run everywhere dont! you will spook animals and never see them. try to find a game with a host that has a high hunter score. ask them to show you, or take you on a hunt. once you learn the tricks, the game becomes exciting and fun.. this is very important. you have been hunting mule deer for hours, now your bored. you want to kill something else. but you dont want to pay for a subscription...you can earn em$ (cash currency) by doing surveys and tasks etc from thehunter website. with em$ you can buy other liscenses in the form of -- days. guess what now you dont have to spend your money. you can also purchase gear, weapons, etc.this game is intimidating, i usually open my games to guests and help them out. i fully understand why people do negative reviews.guys/girls this game is amazing in the aspect of what it was meant for. if you have patiencea little bit of time to spendand willing to spend a few bucksyou will not be dissapointed.i recommend this to any hunter enthusiast.",1

10898,"i'm an ex mtg player. i played hearthstone for quite some time before moving onto other ccgs and i'm currently enjoying shadowverse. this review may come off extremely critical, but with so many fp online ccgs to choose from, i feel it's warrented.your power (resource) cards are drawn from the same pile as your other cards. this leads to flooding and not getting enough power far too frequently. since this is a digital card game there are several better options and there is no need for this serious problem to occur. if they wanted to have players draw the power cards, they could have just made two seperate draw piles for resources and non-power cards and let the player choose what they want to draw to avoid this.going first has a large advantage. the only thing you get for going second is you draw first (firs player skips their initial draw). that's not enough to make up for being the player that's constantly reacting to your opponent's plays since you're basically a turn behind.some cards are obviously pushed too far. some cards have stats and abilities well above what they should have at their cost and are often put at higher rarity which makes them harder to obtain for new players. while some colors need these to be balanced compaired to the other colors, this is still at the very least a poor and lazy way to balance. eternal currently has no casual play, only ranked. why would it take so long to implament this very basic game mode? if you're fine with only playing ranked as i am, then it's a non-issue, however i know other players get anxiety when they play in ranked modes or just want a place to test things out and mess around when they don't feel up to playing ranked so i thought others should at least be aware.these next couple are just things i didn't like about eternal, but wouldn't call inherantly negative parts of the game.defender decides what is blocked and how the blocks occur. this leads to too many board stalls.damage is wiped from units at the end of the turn. again this leads to board stalls since you can't just chip down a big minion over time and you often won't want to attack with it either since your opponent can assign multiple blockers and kill it if it attacks.this game isn't all bad though, i did like being able to play against the ai to earn some chests (which contain cards). the drafting process was also well done. ui and art are decent enough.if you have no fast spells (cards that can be played on your opponent's turn) the game doesn't require an ok to progress the game which does help speed things up a bit. however if a player does have a fast spell, then the game requires you to push a button in between plays to progress. players should be able to quickly tell the time difference in between plays and know that you have a fast spell. this information can/will cause different plays vs. if the player didn't have that information.tl;dr there are better fp ccgs for me. if you're looking for something closer to mtg than hearthstone, and the above issues don't bother you, then it's worth a shot.",0
2841,"do not let the free to play aspect fool you. what you don't pay with your money you pay with your health.used to be a great game, now it's a pro-fascist propaganda tool.- toxic community (mostly us servers)- untolerable disbalance in favor of fascist factions in tank battles so you're stuck grinding for silver even tho grinding is already bad in the game.- excessive grinding in rank and up even with premium (paid).- overpriced content.- biased in-game admins who block users for no other reason than to just responding into chat unless they are pro-fascist/us in which case even cursing is allowed and goes unpunished, i've seen it happen a lot.- content milking, ie you activate a booster only to be mismatched against much higher opponents just so you can waste your boosters without profit even if you pay real money for it.- once realistic balanced environment now makes legendary tanks look like cardboard boxes with turrets.- limited coop which is at times severely restricted to paid content and forces players to play arcade game mode to even participate while supressing realistic gaming in the game (sb) with limited cycled events.- installs an agent client that starts as a service. while it is only understandable that gaijin may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and uplay this agent is at times aggressive and cannot be stopped, it also conflicts with security tools.- much more wrong with this game i won't even bother, just stay away from it.the only thing that is somewhat fun is simulator flight battles and that in particular if you play with friends, everything else has turned into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege. spare yourself and your wallet, do not make the same mistake and play something more meaningful, if this game continues on this path it will die as war thunder within next - months.",0

16966,"cuisine royale is a parody game of most battle royale games out there. despite being a parody, it's actually one of the best battle royale games. i've played fortnite, pubg, and some other battle royale games. despite that fact, i still think this is the best battle royale game out there.the art style is great. as a history lover, me and my friends all like the wwii setting and it's good to see what the game they're working on will become. the way the animations work is hilarious and goofy, purposefully, is great and it fits the design perfectly. the idea of protecting yourself with kitchen gear as a man in his underpants is comedic, and definately helps the game show it's a joke game.even though it's a parody, it's better than pubg. the gameplay is great, and is way faster than pubg, and is less boring. a cuisine royale match takes / of the time that a pubg match does, and you'll have more fun playing it. the game is fast-paced and gets your blood pumping, and it's realistic style helps it's surreal atmosphere. the gunplay is pretty solid except for some rather questionable times, and it remains to be fun even after multiple matches.in total, the game is great and i think it plays really well. with the ability to play squads and duos, it's really good to play with my friends and we love this quirky game. i would recommend getting it before it becomes paid.",1

2498,"it has turned so much worse over the last years.i joined the game before .the game was fun in the begining...at first i said to myself:'well, i'll wait until i figured out how to play properly before eventually paying some bucks for a premium account.but soon i got it: gaijin just wants user to pay for premium vehicles or quick-repairs (prem. account)... without any benefit from it. a prem. account just means you can place more badges to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lions after a match, (= in-game-money to pay your repairs if you get shot).that's what i'd call 'free to play - pay to win'. special ammo or repairs will cost you silver lions so basically real money.if you really are mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assured: you'll get affronted to the fact that russian vehicles (planes or tanks) are the greatest in the world. no one can defeat their armor or aigility. is this true? i can't find any wiki article that confrims that russian technique was outstanding back in the days. it was unreliable and let's say: their planes were bad compared german planes.that's why i'd call the dev's: liars. but wait... there's even more:gaijin is just announcing new stuff, which is incompletely developed and balanced.old issues about bad balancing and bad realism aren't corrected. the only thing you'll feel in newer versions of the game is that russian vehicles are getting stronger...to my mind, this game is basically a russian propaganda machine.. and about the worst issue:gaijin claims that there ain't no cheaters in the game it is not possible, they say that everything regarding balancing is calculated by the servers.well... dozens of youtube videos prove that - yes it is true, there are cheaters.so my conclusion: gaijin is just another software company with the objective to gain money. but in this case, they lie to their community in every respect. they don't wanna care about fair -play (avoiding cheats) or realism.don't waste your time.",0

4677,"i have played moba games so far and i wasn't really into trying another one but recently i wanted to give it a shot since i heard about it a lot and got released on steam. i now play mainly hots and i love it but i will play smite as an off-moba sometimes cause it has some features that don't require me to invest time to learn from the beggining a new moba and set it part a bit from the classic strategy focused lol and dota. so if you too are heavily invested in a main moba, here are the reasons why you should play smite to blow off some steam every now and then. ) it has game modes that require no jungling or warding and it is just mindless massacre: arena and assault, mainly arena is the pure massacre with no real towers, just plainly kill each other. )it has the option to auto lvl up and auto purchase items, so if you can't bother like me to learn about new items and skills or whatever this contributes tremendously in just going in and kill gods, eventually though you will start wanting to purchase your own items since you will play enough to have the urge to change your build a bit. ) it gives away for free some starting gods that are relatively easy and fun to play so no need to farm asap for your first god. generally it is a unique gameplay wise moba and the action based camera and combat have an amusing feeling. at first it will be hard to get used to the gameplay specially if you come from another moba game but eventually you get used to it and it is quite fun. if you are a starter on moba genre, i wouldn't suggest smite as your first moba as it is not a pure representative of genre nor as easy as the other isometric camera view moba games. it retains the fed concept from lol and dota but not in a terrible scale but the % of your hp-one ability concept exists. also the concept of fighting gods is really great and if you love mythology you grow a special feeling when you play your favorite mythological god no matter what his/her abilities are. smite's referal program is quite rewarding and by simply logging in every day in weeks you get a free skin with the amount of gems they give. in-game currency progression is faster than lol's and hots's but not by far and the graphics are quite decent although they could use some improvement in some models, the environments are pretty great though. final verdict: try it if you have played another moba, come back if you are rookie after you have played another moba.",1

5273,"a free, platform-based brawler reminiscent of the super smash bros series. there's a wide roster of characters with multiple movesets based on what weapon they're holding. all good and well, except everything in this game is made to be absolutely infuriating.- as smooth as the servers are, the way they correct themselves means hearing and seeing an attack connect without it actually connecting. you will get a lot of false positives in any multiplayer mode.- the casual ffa mode almost always ends up a huge cluster. your combos will be constantly be interrupted by other people, and it will not be fun.- when a high level ranked player enters the ffa for some reason, they will curbstomp everyone there guaranteed. because not even the casuals are allowed to have fun.- certain legends have been the subject of multiple complaints due to being drastically harder to deal with compared to other legends. nothing will actually be done about this because this is mostly a problem at lower levels of play, and everyone knows that if you aren't diamond, you don't matter.- the community is a cesspool of acid and salt. there is a button that will literally say 'gg' for you in the after-match chat, and players would still rather take the time to cuss you out than just press that button and leave.- ranked is filled with absolutely awful strategies to put up with such as constantly jumping up and down and being impossible to hit, running away, camping on the side of the stage, and only counter-attacking.- the matchmaking for ranked has always been awful, matching players up with others completely out of their league. in other words, the matchmaker focuses more on speed than fairness.- a lot of spanish players play on the english servers for...some...reason. they'll still rage at you in spanish.the game's biggest selling points are probably that this is a free platform brawler available on steam, and all of the legends are impressively balanced at high-level play. otherwise the game doesn't bring anything new to the table, even the flashiest specials aren't that impressive, and the soundtrack is hilariously underwhelming. long story short, if you only played fox in super smash bros melee and think only losers or noobs play for fun, you'll probably like this game.",0

13159,"i started playing this because i was under the mistaken assumption it provided unlocks in fallout . it does not, if you have the same misconception.so, why the negative review? and the answer is that the game uses tedium and enforced grinding as a gameplay mechanic, and it doesn't have to.the game concept itself is novel enough, and if you like the fallout universe, it's pretty cute. it's simple, but it was meant for mobile devices, so that makes sense. build a vault, manage your settlers, fight baddies for loot, rinse, wash and repeat. all of that is just well and dandy.the problem arises from the fact that there's basically no ai, and everything is agonizingly manual. resources got produced? gather those suckers manually. loot got found? gather that stuff manually. danger at the vault? manually tell people to go help. and then go to the next room when the danger spreads, rather than remember why they were sent. ready to give birth? not until the overseer delivers your kid themself. it goes on and on.it's micromanagement without depth, which means that it's just a chore, at the end of the day. well, that and waiting. the combat system is % waiting, and not whilst the app/game is closed; sit there, and watch healthbars slowly fall, hoping you'll get a crit and somethingf to do.and then they hit you with the paid content to make things quicker, easier, and more automated. you literally pay to play less, and be bothered less. nothing against paid content, they have a right to make money from their work. but paid content should give you more of the game, not less of the annoyance. top tier weapons? just less waiting in combat. you can bypass the whole process by not playing it at all.",0

5137,"tl;dr:it's a great game already. if you like the kind of combat you find in smash, if you like shiny ranks, and if you like nice streamers, then this is for you!pros:- it's not a traditional combo-based fighter. anyone familiar with smash bros will feel right at home.- the attacks feel very satisfying. the controls are super smooth too.- dare i say it? yeah, i do: items feel very balanced in this game. none of this fox only no items final destination stuff.- you pick up one of two character specific weapons that alter your moveset (you drop 'em if you get wrecked).- the weapons spawning randomly on the battlefield opens up for quake-like weapon denying, which is pretty fun, both as the guy trying to outmaneuver the guy with the pointy rocket-stick and said rocket-stick guy who's got a scrub to turn into a pincushion (they spawn rather regularly, so dying once wont end the game for you).- you can throw your weapon. and it feels so satisfying to toss a spear in someones face and then grab it into a combo. - i'll actually put in another pro just for throwing. did i mention it feels satisfying?- it has a training mode that displays hitboxes and hurtboxes clear as day. it makes practicing easy.- there is a cash shop, but it contains cosmetics only. - extremely polished for an early access title. this is what early access should be like.cons:- only one server, and its in the us. playing fighting games online with < ms is not particularly entertaining (hopefully us europoors will get our grubby mitts on one of our own soon enough). now is the time eurobros- the health circles at the top right is a bit far off. one glance up there to gauge everyones health could be your unfortunate end. (if you put it at the bottom of the screen like smash does that'd be swell. i wont tell nintendo)- the hardest cpu setting in training is nowhere near a player in terms of difficulty.- the announcer pronounces bdvars name as bodvar. now keep in mind folks, this game is compared a lot to smash but it is its own game. its probably not going to be completely similar to smash bros, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic game. now if the developers of this game happens to be reading this:thank you for being the first to make a game like this for pc! i bought the collectors pack and i'll try my best to prove to you that there is a market for this kind of game by forcing friends to do the same at gunpoint. i hope you will continue working hard on this great game.i'd give this game an /, and its probably gonna be my or even after it goes out of beta.",1

3238,"so, after games, how does it stack up against favourites like pubg, hz and last man standing?pretty well!there's even a backstory; you and a bunch of other tourists get stranded in a winter landscape. a resuce chopper is coming but only has four seats... and the freezing blizzard is closing in fast. you gotta secure a seat on that chopper, whatever it takes. yes more than one person can 'win' the round by escaping in the chopper, although obviously its a 'shoot first ask questions later' mentality as per all royale style games.graphically its pretty decent, very similar to pubg, and gameplay is about the same as well. weapons and loot are well distributed and with decent types available there's something for everyone. m? check. mp? check. mosin nagant sniper? check. desert eagle .? check. silencers, scopes, grips and healthkits round out a good compliment of weapons and armor, and 'supply drops' give extra special loot for those willing to risk running for them.the thing that makes this game different is the class types - you can choose a hanglider at the expense of less carrying capacity, a snowboard for fast downhill action, or a simple climbing pickaxe and zipline - not as fast but a great tactical option, plus you can carry more loot. the class types are pretty cool to use and great when you find the right circumstances to use them. you can rush someone below you with a snowboard, travel from the top of a mountain with the glider, or run down powerlines with the zipline - all great when used to their strengths and a good change from the standard 'hit shift for sprint' mentality of most shooters.weak points are few and far between, with minor things like running through an open door and attempting to close it behind you often sees you stuck on the side you just came from - you must stop, turn around and close the door to prevent this. no big deal. what some may find annoying is the intrusive anti-cheat software which (as of writing) forces you to turn off any system interference - this includes software overclocking utilities like afterburner. yes, i am forced to turn off my gpu's overclock... but i don't care as i havent encountered a cheater yet. thankyou tencent!if you're wondering how it plays on lower-end hardware, i'm currently playing on my backup rig which is a pentium g, gb of ddr and a gtx gb card. nothing special, but it nets fps+ easily with standard settings at p.matches boot quickly and are fun to play, this is a title to watch for sure. highly recommended for fans of the battle royale genre, or anyone who is just over dealing with pubg's issues.",1

3129,"this game started out as a very fun, exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing. but now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. i started playing while they still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy one plane... one! you'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. so if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there.",0

2879,"look, i'll admit i play more than my fair share, and will continue to play. i don't drop on real world cash on the game, and for good reason. gaijin's entire monetary gain is based on your own frustration and bottlenecking you to put money down. you can play, sure, without spending any money, that's what i do, but the amount of time and effort you're going to expend: it's going to be at least x that of a premium player, and god forbid you want to try any vehicle that is premium based. entire sections of the game (such as italian tanks, most lend-lease/captured vehicles, certain camouflages, etc) are totally locked from players unless they drop real world cash on it or spends insane amounts of time on wagers which are extremely unreliable in themselves.unlike most other games that these days encourage more sportsmanlike fighting, gaijin is the exact opposite: punishing victims of teamkillers and rammers, encouraging spawn camping (both ways) and moreover empowering wallet warriors. from throwing coupons at you, to pointing out every game here's what you would get if you were premium, to parts/fps/re-crewing grinding, and more... gaijen has largely by far created a game that doesn't extract money by tricking you into lootboxes, or loud showy sounds or other psychological trick: it's often pay with your wallet or patience.i won't tell you to not play it, because it can be fun, i find it fun, i really do: but frankly, if you want a dev that actually cares about player feedback, don't play this game. if you want a game that is fully free to play, don't play this game. i could go on but... this became a dead horse beating.the fact of the matter is:for the love of god don't give gaijin your money. they do not need any more encouragement. they really don't. seriously. it's to such a point that you can find statements from gaijjn employees that basically conflate player frustration / grind with profits. and if you're rich and you think this game is for you: don't be fooled. even for the whales, you'll feel the sting of things because notice how i haven't said, it's pay to win. because it's not: moreover, it's pay to avoid spending excess time. you can buy the most expensive things in the game, you could buy every last bit of content in the game with real world cash, and ultimately, it won't give you any increase in skill or anything. you'll still find yourself sucker punched in spawn by a guided rocket, you'll still find yourself being dove on by a chalka, you'll still get that single bullet hitting you that splits your aircraft in two.so just... play it, don't play it... just don't give gaijin more of your cash until they stop abusing the player base.because really, for those who actually shell out cash to this game, it's always an abusive cycle of...legitimate complaints -> introduce shiny new vehicles -> add more microtransactions -> legitimate complaints.it's an abusive cycle, and frankly: it's only going to sour gaijin and the player base more as it repeats.",0
2013,"stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. path of exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. no pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. path of exile was meant to be the diablo successor that i've always dreamed of... but is it?the first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. the character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true diablo formula. there's plenty of strategy to implement here. i thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.but where did it all go wrong?the second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. cruel difficulty is terribly unbalanced. you will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. regardless of how you die, you will lose % of your experience on this difficulty. this function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. diablo did this, except the game is years old, and years is enough time for game developers to realize yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience. grinding gear games didn't get the memo, it seems. regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and cruel penalties. my desire to play was crushed once i was met with this awful formula. as an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by %, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.due to this massive difficulty boost, you require a build to survive. there is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional mmo). it essentially becomes a game like dark souls - a game for masochists. a game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. to even scrape by.these are the reasons why i do not recommend this game. the beginning showed lots of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. there's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the dark souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.thankfully, i didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. i hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0

10472,"great game to play, even as a free to play player... however, this game is a pay to enjoy style game, very few items are available for the player earned currency and this extremely limits a new players ability to experience the true depth of this game.. the only real option left for anyone who finds this game fun, but either does not want to pay, or simply cant afford to, is to let the game stagnate to a point where you hunt the same single type of mob every time you play (being mule deer) as the starter setup is too powerful to kill the only other animal your licensed to hunt (being the whitetail rabbit i think its called) i shot , and its trophy value was zero due to overpowered gun... leading the unsuspecting hunter to a point of requiring to spend real money to play beyond square one.overall, the graphics are decent and the gameplay is great, i think if the game designers implemented a little more options for the free to play community, this game could become quite a bit more well known.my game recommendation is no, only due to the lack for free-to-play playablilty when the game is listed as fp.",0

1103,"so far i have really enjoyed playing this game, particularily the larger ships like the leviathon and destroyer. definately recommend this game to anyone who likes space. i do think there needs to be some changes to hp for some ships, especially the cloaked ships and sniper. a ship that has devestating alpha, can cloak, has decent speed, and more base hp than the fast ships that would be hunting them seems slightly unbalanced to me. don't get me wrong, i love playing them but they are just don't have enough weaknesses for the role they are filling. sniper ship also needs less hp and its guns should have slower movement(not too much slower but a sniper shouldnt be able to follow a frigate km away(and to the side) and hit every time. think a tank destroyer in world of tanks vs a fast medium or light. they can hit but it's much harder. i think the carrier damage rating should be reduced point as well. it really is more of a support/defensive ship and even in close range with max upgrades(vs a max upgrade opponent) it doesnt seem to match the offensive output indicated by its rating. just to be clear, i think the damage is fine(but i wouldn't complain if there were a few more bombers per wing) but that it doesn't seem to meet the current offensive rating from what i've found. these current specs are not game breaking by any means and pilot skill usually always wins but i do feel these are relatively easy fixes that would help game balance.",1
