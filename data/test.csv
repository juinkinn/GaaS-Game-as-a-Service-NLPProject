13303,"i avoided this game, people kept telling me to get it and i wouldn't as the pictures looked crap, and it looked like minecraft, someone wanted me to record with them so i got the game, and i can say that i really love this game, it can be so addictive. but all depends on if you sort of like things like this, i am not that keen on minecraft which this game is very much like, but i have to say it's so much better than minecraft, and there is so much to do, you don't just craft something and that is it, you find something to craft, but before you learn how to craft that item, you have to find items for the recipe but some of the items you need you have to learn to craft them aswell, very complicated to explain in writing than it is in the game lol, but it goes in a circle, so much more to it. wonderful graphics, creatures are amazing, you can tame them, and then use them for certain items. you can spend hours and hours on this learning all the items to craft, building a base, taming, searching for different biomes. this game could be so much more popular if it came onto xbox or ps4 and i could see it being on ipads, it would appeal to young and old. you won't know if you will like it until you get this game.",1
11210,"not worth playing in current form. 19/20 games decided by power card draws or lack there of. you end up feeling as if you never did anyting to win and never did anyting to deserve losing. not a good combination.too much competition. all other major card games do their niche better. eternal should have made the decision for a new power system. shadowverse beats it on originality, magic beats it at the game magic invented, hearthstone quicker more approachable. solution could be a complete restructureing of the power system. more likely to be implemented some sort of cycle system. let me cycle power cards (for when i have to many) and let me transform cards(into power) or cycle them (for when i draw no power cards). right now they are relying on the ancient land system without the mature card collection.",0

3129,"this game started out as a very fun, exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing. but now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. i started playing while they still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy one plane... one! you'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. so if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there.",0

8265,"it works fine as a free to play. keep in mind there are some pay walls that although grindable, would take many months.- you will never have a fast mount (60% inc is the base)- you will never have the best item enhancements (yours will be half as good, approx.)- it's pay to win.. do not pvp unless you are paying or enjoy getting 1 shot.the game itself has a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spells on your action bar, which are players choice, but it's not much and gets repetitive fast. it takes about 30 hours to get to max level, then due to the 'daily' system for the 4 high level zones (where you unlock better gear and harder dungeons) it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned players.character roles are a bit odd compared to other mmo's, if you are good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeons without a tank or healer, even at high level the healer is more for buffing the other players than actually keepin them alive, i.e. not a vital part of the team. the tank has the same issue with none tanks able to go off soloing in dungeons. it gives the game an easy feel, with little need for teamwork, just button mashing. you dont need allot of skill to play, just either allot of time, or more commonly, money.it's still good fun, it's just this game doesnt go anywhere, there is no sense of accomplishment. you will reach a point where you dont want to pay real money for next upgrade, and the time to get it by grinding dungeons/mobs/trading is just too great to be considered worthwhile or at the very least, enjoyable.",1

5739,"i am not an expert on flight simulators by any stretch of the imagination, so fair warning, i may be naive or ignorant in my assessment of this game. that said, by far i believe dcs world, and what i have seen of its addons including dcs: a-10c warthog, to be the most comprehensive and realistic modern combat flight simulator series i have ever seen. many thanks to the developers for making the base game available for free on steam. there's a lot included in dcs world to appeal to both the hardcore flight simulation crowd and to educators.there are some minor omissions and simplifications from dcs world's default aircraft model, the su-25, compared to its dlc packages in terms of the compexity of the cockpit's controls and graphical complexity, but what is available is so impressive to me i can't complain. even this simplified model is more complex than many flight sims i've experienced in the past.it's a good sign that some of the original companies which designed aircraft featured in this series are assisting with the development of the game/simulator, alongside the usual industry veterans. the sound design, user interface design, controls, mission editor and scripting system all seem to be quite well-executed. the game supports flightsticks, hotas and trackir, as well as (a rather inappropriate method of control in my opinion) the microsoft xbox 360 controller alongside a mouse and keyboard.i've not yet completely explored what the game has to offer in terms of difficulty levels, or rather, aircraft simulation settings, but my advice is that people who are looking for a casual, pick-up-and-go flight simulator should do their research or probably look elsewhere, as the game may be far more complex than expected. that said, you can't beat the price, so i would insist that you test the game out and see what you think of it first. there's plenty of tutorials in-game as well as available on the internet to help you become accustomed to the su-25's basic startup/taxi/takeoff/landing procedures and usage in combat.if you are interested in online multiplayer, there is a thriving community of dcs world players online these days. i bet there's a wingman available to help you out.overall, at a first impression i consider dcs world and its expansions to be an excellent value for its cost. i look forward to buying the expansions.",1

7146,"well the game has been out for a while and i've playing for a while. i am saying no on this game purely because of consistent issues that have not and do not seem to get any attention what so ever. as far as an online ccg that game is self is pretty good. very interesting, i love that they have vocabulary for the game you need to learn. makes it less simple and engages you more in terms of having to give some thought to making decks that win which i like.problems are with the computer version and the phone app that are constant and never receive any attention even though other players have left multiple complaints:too many loading screens. in between everything in this game is a loading screen. you want to go see your decks, loading screen, you want to see one particular deck, loading screen. you want to check your quest progress, loading screen. and here is the biggest problem with that, you get kicked out of your game and try to get back in, you have to sit through loading screens first. by time that is done your opponent is 2 turns ahead of you already. bringing me to my next point.too many disconnects. this game disconnects far to often and most of the time it is not my internet. there have been multiple complaints about this and it is still bad after all this time. i don't know about everyone else but time is money. disconnects are a waste of my time and money.there needs to be a larger box for putting prophecy cards back into your had when you don't wish to cast them. i don't know how many times i have lightning bolted myself in the face because i was a micro fraction off in putting the card in my hand. yes both on computer and app.on the app its self navigation is horrible. just trying to be able to search a card is a major pain. might be different per one but i have an s8 with that stupid infinity edge. not sure if that is the cause but it is very difficult to get the search bar to pop up the keyboard. it just sits there going from grey to white on and off. also trying to advance through your cards is the same. have to press the little arrow button 100 times before it will advance. some of it may be lag but i suspect some of it is not. so formatting on that is kind of crap.i won't go too deep into how they listen too often to whiners about cards that beat there decks so they cry until the card that beat them gets nerfed. it happens in all games and its here too.i played hearthstone for a number of years as well as shadow era so this is what i am comparing to. i never had complaints like these or saw complaints for hs of se, one large company and one smaller company so i completely expect that bethesda should be able to step up their game on this. i think bethesda is know for releasing half finished projects but in the amount of time that has gone by all of these things should have been priority before new content. i giving this a no but people will continue to get this game and play it because its fun and it works. i am hoping that bethesda with fix their half finished crap for once so we can enjoy this game to its fullest potential.",0

25521,"here are some common ones.- lack of female characters. important characters and playable characters are all or almost all male. while having some games with male protagonists is obviously normal, having the vast majority be male can start to make people feel unwanted. - fewer options for female characters. an example is the ~~stardew valley~~ (edit: wrong title, meant harvest moon) game where male characters could continue playing after having an in-game baby, but female characters could not.- female characters dressed in much more revealing or sexualized outfits than male characters. it's not fun to feel like a game considers you nothing more than eye candy or sex sells.- female characters having weaker abilities or support only abilities when compared to male characters. that's things like making the female characters stealth while the male characters can fight, or having the female characters have primarily healer or support abilities. again, not a problem if it happens sometimes, but definitely a problem when it's happening constantly. - consistently presenting female characters as things to be escorted, saved, or won. - the villains getting immediately rapey when threatening female characters, but not when threatening male characters.the game never starts up by saying and there are no girls allowed in our clubhouse! it's little things here and there that make you realize that a game doesn't want you, or doesn't expect you to be playing. that the game maybe considers you nothing more than a sex object, or on the less extreme side simply considers you less important than male players.",1

2824,"this game has always had the standard free 2 play issues, however recently the dev's have made it intolerable and just not worth even wasting your time or hard-drive space on. the game is very firmly pay 2 win now with hours and days of grinding required to get a single vehicle to a point where it is viable against any other opponents, your only option is to pay significant amounts of money for in-game currency to bypass the grind and be able to win or get any kills with your vehicle. i would firmly stay away from this game and for aircraft and tank battle enthusists i'd highly recommend il-2 sturmovik or the other il-2 games instead, those games are a 1 time purchase for honestly superior aircraft and dogfighting combat in terms of realism.",0

4352,"i've played duel links for over 130~ hours now, there's a few negatives and positives to the game itself, i think after looking it all over, i'm still going to give it a positive review, just due to the fact it may not be perfect, but it's the best yu-gi-oh game on the market, and it's been fun playing for 130+ hours regardless of its flaws.positives-when i first started out the game was very generious with gifting gems (what you need to purchase card packs)i received almost 2500 gems upon starting out, enough to open over 50 packs-thousands of ways to make your deck personal-lower tier pvp was really fun ( more on that in negatives )negatives-once i got around 110~ hours into the game, i hit a wall, it's become near impossible to obtain gems easily. every 8~ hours or so i can only obtain 50-100 gems, enough to only open 1-2 card packs (if you're trying to find that deck you want it's almost impossible at this pace)-again, after that 110~ hour mark it becomes apparent you need to spend money to keep going in the game competitively speaking-when you're in the higher rankings for pvp you'll have the same deck played against you every game, people use the best meta deck available instead of being creative, you'll have to face the infamous cyber angel deck which is near impossible to beat.the pvp becomes very boring due to the lack of diversity in this stage.-when also pvping you'll be going against players from around the world, this also causes some major issues with the lag, your connection will wave in-and-out causing matches to last way longer than normal",1

12333,"edit: so i gave this game more time than most and played with friends and old guild members hoping the game would become what it was striving for. at the current moment i don't believe anytime soon it'll get near that point but i was never hyped about the game to start with, i knew about it prior to it's release in kr, ru, and jp and the tab-targeting really put me off but my friends were excited so i gave it over 60hrs! had an issue with quest items being locked to my inventory on may 31st, replied to it on june 3rd because no one answered my pleas for help, and then on june 15th i was told my issue was too old and newer requests for help were more important so i would need to resubmit my issue to have it resolved.at least with ark and conan exiles i have an excuse for keeping them despite them being in ea for so long, i cannot do that with bless.===like any early access game there is a lack of content, features, the server stability and optimization is also something i expected with my 5yrs+ of mmo launches for various games (tera, swtor, gw2, archeage, blade and soul, black desert online, and more).so far i am enjoying the game even though i looked past it once i realized back in 2016 it was marketed as tab-target, however that has changed in the years it's been released in other regions with the action combat camera choice that is currently only available to berserkers (but will be available to all classes soon).the gameplay is something to get use to like with any other newly ported na/eu release from overseas, but i'm enjoying myself and learning how to play various classes, berserker, ranger, and mage so far, and hope to play mystic, assassin, and warlock once those are released! the combo system is automated so you have a starter skill then the option to combo skill on top of that (these skills aren't available unless you use a certain starter skill) which are keybind by default to r,t,y. you continue the combo twice using the same intial key (ex. 1 > r > r or 2 > t > t or 3 > y > y), some skills with have a bouncing down arrow on them to indiciate that they can be charged and the charge available for these attacks are shown as bubbles above the skill icon - so far i've seen a max of two complete charges that can be performed on a skill.the map looks pretty cool but difficult to navigate when you're trying to follow a quest that's directing you to a new city. there are three ways of travel that i've discovered so far: wyvern (air), gondola (waterway), and airship (air), each cost a fee that can be decreased with the games premium subscription at which it is decreased by 50% (only wyvern fees are decreased by premium).so far with the game i have not claimed my 30 days premium as i do not feel hindered without it, mainly i feel this way because of the games i've listed above have had similar payment models (some even starting as p2p and turning into f2p w/subscription option) and i've opted out of purchasing the subscriptions offered (if offered) as it had no impact on my personal gameplay and being current with pvp (while not exactly being in the top tier) was not difficult to obtain or maintain during my days within those games. was it difficult? not really but it would've been easier and more profitable if i had them but that is personal perspective as well as whether or not you consider yourself a hardcore player in the top 1% and feeling a need to acquire an advantages available to you.i will be testing the premium when the game has concluded it's 2 day headstart and will update with more information about the game as i progress through levels, zones, and professions!",0

1661,"this game has nothing to offer anybody. there is no quality fun you cannot get more quickly and efficiently elsewhere. this is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and free-time. you are becoming more bitter, narrow-minded, haughty, and old. quit now and delete this game. there is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide.people do not have fun here. players do not communicate succesfully with one another, they nitpick mistakes with witty remarks and mock each other. nobody is interested in the truth; people are battling for fleeting moments of superiority. players are loud jackasses who tumble into one argument after another, anxiously waiting for you to respond to ensure they keep the last word every time. a fair and balanced match is one in ten thousand, and no matter how hard you filter those matchmaking options you are still searching for diamonds in a garbage dump.this game is not making you happy. you are not having fun. you are not gathering fun experiences to tell, learning, or growing as a person. instead you rage every thirty minutes and are occasionally spurred to rage quitting by russian teammates who believe they won the cold war. you are addicted to readily available fun and pressure free social interaction. this game is slowly poisoning you with misogyny, anti-semitism, narcissism, a false dichotomy surrounding pro-gamers, and insecurity.i'm not telling you to get good. i'm not telling you to go outside. i'm not even telling you to make friends. just quit dota. do anything else.",0

4295,"the game is designed and ran in such as way as to separate you from as much money as possible. decks are being power-crept out of the game practically every month, with a slightly more efficient otk build being released in every new box. near enough every game is decided with a combination of rock paper scissors and a coin flip. are you playing the latest meta deck or a specific counter? if yes, flip a coin. if tails, you go second and otk them for the win, if heads, you go first, watch your board get wiped, and otk'd. there is very little interactivity in the game beyond this at the moment.as a new player you will get enough new gems to pick up the cards you need for the latest otk deck. after this you might even earn enough gems for the next latest. but sooner rather than later you'll find your supply of currency drying up and any sort of vaguely competetive pvp will become impossible (and you are absoloutely screwed if you want to build any of the older archetypes that are often spread accross three or four boxes). at this point you will either quit the game or become a whale, throwing money at it until you suddenly realise just how much fun you /could/ have been having spending that money on something else. if you have the disposable income or are strong-willed enough to grind completely free to play and don't intend to enguage in serious pvp matches you might find some enjoyment. otherwise i would highly recommend avoiding, especially if you lack self control when it comes to freemium.",0

4613,"this game has its pros and its cons. having 1000+ hours invested in this game, i can make a little analysis.most of this analysis will be based on the game mode conquest because that is the ompetitive, premier game mode. first of all, no you cannot transition from league of legends to this game. the two games have separate metas to each game. while it is also a moba, it is not a game that you can pick up. that being said, this is not an easy game. you will have to have a grasp of over 90 gods and their kits, and learn there pros and cons and matchups against other characters. secondly, it will take a while to face people that know what they're doing. before they introduced the new leveling system, the maximum level was level 30. if you were not level 30, people would call out things like it was league of legends instead of understanding the choices in lanes were relative and you must pick solo lane or duo lane instead of left or right. people will blame you for not being there for them when they were too aggressive and you wanted to cut the losses and steal something from them. people just don't fully grasp the game and what they're doing wrong. it will be frustrating for a little while due to the leveling issues.then you hit a certain level where the entire game changes. it used to be about 20 games into level 30, but now it's different.but once you hit a certain level, the game will choose to test your skills against higher skilled people. people will gank you and be aggressive. they will be smart and group up to steal objectives and gank you. at that point, you will have to commumicate will your teammates and defend what is yours or counter steal another objective or tower. and, for the most part, no matter behind you are in levels and gold, you are never completely out of the fight. as the game goes on respawn timers get longer and you are able to catch up by taking objectives and towers that cold completely turn the game around, and all it takes is a misplay. the long games are some of the most rewarding experiences or biggest heartbreaks in almost any game i've played.the conquest game mode has been up and down since the middle of season 3 and through season 4. i personally barely played season 4, just played enough ranked to get into diamond again. with how the map has been revamped, it feels the most engaging and exciting season i've played.the neat thing about this game is that you can get all the gods and future gods for 30$, and sometimes 15-20$ on sales. the game is very accessible taht way. however, they get there money from loot chests that you have to spend on gems, which you either get from logging on every day, getting up to 50 per week or buying them. all of the good skins are in a pool oftier trash to pretty cool skins. the chests have a set limit on what is in them, ususally ranging at 20 - 50 skins or boosters and misc. they claim that the skins are all randomized and not in a set order, but all the good skins end up to come up when youre at the very end of the list. i encourage people to get coolskins because they do put a lot of effort into them and that's where their creativity comes out. but just keep that in mind when you are planning to buy a chest to get skins.",1

11988,"so, not all that many minutes on record and i'll explain why: after having relaunched the game four times (litterally) i realised that the reason i couldn't press any buttons is that the mouse pointer is actually 2 cm below the one on the screen, probably due to the game launching in windowed mode. however, this very simple issue hung on since the very clever guys put the options menues juuust above the tool bar, so whenever i tried to press it fell outside the game and i got to look at my lovely search bar. but being the determined gamer that i am, i don't let something as trivial as not being able to press buttons and a terrible blurry page stop me, those things can be fixed later on.so i somehow managed to create a character and head into the game. fix the windowed mode to get the mouse pointer back in place and the graphics back up so it doesn't look i'm constantly drunk, only to find to my annoyance that the font size is 2 and i have to look at my screen in a pose like i'm an old man just finding microporn.bye game.",0

10954,"having played the game quite a while and many hours i'd say it is a fine free game. you can get far for free and earn the necessary gold to buy game modes (forge/draft) or boosters quickly.anyway, make sure to be quite zen playing, as there are a couple of points that can get very annoying and have you quit the game for a while.- there is no way to contril your power cards for your decks, they are always added automatically de facto by the number of cards of the factions you added. so several classic game builds are not really possible. doing a bi-color deck using 60% or more quick cheap spells of one color and boosting the rest with mighty cards of another faction? you'll never get the power needed to play the more expensive cards. you need to balance cheap/expensive cards within every faction.- starting the game you have one redraw. have a bad hand, no power or power only hand? think twice if you redraw if you have at least two colors you need in the starting hand. usually (with a high % chance) you'll find your redraw hand either one-color power stuck (2 power max) with either only expensive cards or cards of another color. you need to be lucky to draw them before you are done and dead, what leads to the next point:- the ai seems to always draw what he needs. if he can't get through on the floor he will just start to draw a flyer each turn. you finally get a good creature out while he's empty handed? the kill-spell will follow the next turn, or at least a silence/stun - whatever suits better. you holding a spell killing a creature with 4 attack or higher? the ai will play in a completely weird way (not acting like any player would with his cards on the field) to not have any creature higher than 3. example: 3x 1/1 critts giving him an advantage (card draw/boost/malus on my cards) and playing a 3/3 texting ''you may sacrifice another creature to give this unit +2/+2)... - some cards are not really balanced and overpowered. warcry and void interaction are very powerful, as creatures dying keep all there boosts, so for 1 power you get them back to hand and boosted a further 1/1. nice for a cheapo 8/8 or more for investing 3 power :d also endurance is fine with the hourglass for 1 power. all your creatures can't be stunned or exhausted, and attack/defend every turn...anyway it's a nice game and i like it, just needs some more balancing to harmonize the factions and maybe some of the game techniques and especially would really be fine to at least let the players set a % ratio for the power cards when building a deck.",1

10731,"card game is for sure my favorite digital collectible/trading card game (ccg/tcg). it's super free-to-play friendly and you consistently get free packs & cards over time. even in the beginning, you don't feel like you are completely outmatched just because someone has rarer cards in their deck than you. you can play budget decks (see and still win with a good strategy.it's a bit closer to magic the gathering (mtg) than simpler card games like hearthstone and shadowverse in that you still draw power cards rather than gain power evenly each turn, but there are a lot more mechanics compared to mtg that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power. it's also more like mtg in that it's more complex than the other digital ccg options out there. one major benefit over mtg is that this is strictly a digital game, so you have fun mechanics that would be very hard to pull off for mtg since that still has to cater to a physical card game. for example, stats on killed units remain even if the card returns from the void.just recently (dec 2018), a new set of cards has come out that has really added to the deck-building options. it feels like the popular decks are always changing and you have many different options with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck isn't always the winner.you are definitely rewarded for playing against other players, but, especially in the beginning and after a new set is released, playing against the ai is fun and gives you a lot of cards. the reason is that when you draft cards, unlike other games, they are permanently added to your deck. how cool is that?definitely try it. it's free-to-play and you never feel pressured to put money into the game. you can play on ios, android, steam, & xbox and they are always kept in sync and all rewards are available on all platforms. achievements sync too (except xbox). pvp play is cross-platform.note that you get a free preconstructed deck by using a referral code to sign up (i don't want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you found my review helpful; i'd appreciate it). that said, don't feel bad if you didn't get the deck. you can get all those cards fairly quickly even if you don't use a referral link.the game does make you play the first six or so games of the tutorial, but after that you can skip the tutorial from the settings menu if you don't want to complete it. also check out reddit for a really cool community and more information. there are also a couple links there to free promotions that get a free campaign. you can also get other campaigns by spending in-game currency that you gain just by playing; as i said, you don't have to pay anything. there are some extra visual items that you can purchase (deck backs, etc.), but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they are strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and/or support the developers. even without spending money, new cosmetic options are available to you fairly often.again, the current player-base would love to see the community grow. many players are very pro and competitive, but are great to learn from and super friendly. i am more casual, but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game. i also feel the art style is really cool without being too weird, gross, or overtly sexualized. i wouldn't feel weird about others seeing me play this game, unlike a couple other ccgs out there.",1

1011,"product received for freeearly access reviewfor those who want to know a little more before getting this game, here is a basic overview of what is going on:-the game is a 5v5 conquest style, the objective is to control key strategic areas in order to gain access to the enemys base and ultimatly capture it-strategys are very important, there are two left and right side wings where you must work up to the enemy side in order to capture a key jump base to get to the enemy base, this plays very well as they are effictevly two seperate maps.-in order to get between the maps you must jump to them, it takes one jump to return to base and two to cross to the other side (ignoring the middle gamma for now), this is very similar to games such as league, where there is effictevly a time gap one can use to make pushes but also allows quick defense, depending on what the other team is doing.-on each side of these two wings are resources you can capture to help buff your team (like a leveling system) - hence control on these is also important-behind these two wings are the bases on each side, which also act as basically seperate maps-finally there is a middle map, that every few minutes will open up. capturing this gives your team a strong buff. battles for these are often heated and are a great way of turning a losing fight around or making the final strike to win a battle. if your team controls one of the enemy's base jump points you can also jump directly to the enemy base.the ships-you play with massive space ships (this is simply the coolest thing ever)-there are three manufactures, each with thier own designs letting you pick/choose your prefered ships-each ship has a role, the basic three being defense, support and attack (with many permutations, but for simplisity these are the main three)-at the begining of a match you can choose your ship and as well talk with your team on your prefered ship and find a suitable team composition-the ships play very well, i find many enjoyable and balancedoverall i am very impressed with what the devs have put together. i personally enjoy balanced competitive games where there is little luck or dice rolling involved and that victory is because you have played better than the other team. so far the community has been great as well, which is fantastic.final comments, the game is free and probably the best space game i have played in a while. just awesome.",1

9579,"okay, were to begin, this game has just been sold to a new complany, so if you play or are thinking of playing know it will be under further development. this game is an mmo, there is no pvp only a realm (2-5 in each server) with a maximum of 85 people all fighting events, bosses, minibosses, gods and minions to level up, better their gear and of course complete all the objective to verse oryx the mad god. the game is a perma death, meaning if you die, you die, and no matter how many hours you have on that character, its dead make a new one. so when you die it can be quite stressful, panic-related shock and anger causing. having oover 1000+ hours on the game it safe to say i have died alot, quit alot and restarted alot. the idea of the game is to get loot from bosses, better the teir of your items or get unteired items from certain bosses that are really good. now the game itself is quite repetetive, so if you see everything once or twice, if you keep playing you'll ebd up seeing it thousands of times (thats not a joke). taking into consideration the game will be soon under development, expect new things monthly even weekly. i rate this game 8/10 with friends (very fun and addicting) and 5/10 without (very boring). so if you're looking to play/invest money into this game as it is very 'pay to win', make sure you have friends to do it with you. final thoughts of this game or rating is 7/10, highly enjoyable for the most part, would spend the 1000+ hours again.",1
6273,"if you are looking for a free to play world war 2 game this not for you. it is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. i am an ironsight player from other ww2 games all the way up to modern fps games and the sights for this game are just horrendous. map layout- the layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.weapons- starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. if you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). if you use a gun or grenade too much you have to repair it. yes you have to repair a grenade!!! the expense of repairing a weapon or grenade is about the same price as a new gun. so if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game. free to play- yes you can download it and play a few games for free. but if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. or you can shell out money to play. i have played world of tanks, war thunder, and other ww2 ftp games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game. this is no where near a free to play game. yes this is a beta so maybe it will change but right now it is very much a free but you have to pay to continue farther game.",0

10718,"i wish the reviews had a neutral option. the game has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be the top ccg. it by far has the best single player & ai of any game in the genre. there is a very fun and free single player mode vs the ai that gives you lots of cards / gold. they are very generous and make the collection building much easier than other games. the ranked system is actually very well done. you need 100 points to rank up and every win gives you some points and a loss takes some away. you gain more points for wins than points loss for losing. i have a few key issues with this game which is the main reason i only really play to do daily quest now and instead play elder scrolls legends with most of my time. elder scrolls legends is by far the bes ccg available and it's a shame nobody has heard of. it's kind of funny that dire wolf is also doing elder scrolls, but yet that game blows away eternal. anyway, let's get into the actual problem. the decks are just too large with 70 cards, but they do allow for up to 4 copies of each card. carrying 4 copies of each with 70 cards is not the same as having a 35 card deck with 2 copies of each. your extra copies or even all of the copies of 1 card can and often do end up in the latter 2/3rds of the deck which never see play. there are just too many total cards to be able to have very consistent gameplay. i have spent a little over half of my time playing ranked matches and i have had only a couple of games that actually felt like good solid games on both sides. just for a comparison, elder scrolls has almost every game feel like a good close game with the winner being determined based on skill more than rng. the other 99% of games were just blowout wins or losses. too often the game is decided in the opening hand. whoever wins or loses is more often a question of which player gets a better distribution of their sigils rather than who actually played better or had a better constructed deck.you put 50 cards into the deck and then you are forced to put at least 25 sigil cards. if you want to play a 1 cost unit then you must first play 1 sigil. to play a 2 cost unit requires you to have played 2 total sigils and you can only play 1 sigil per turn. in theory this is a good idea, but their system needs some serious tweaking to make the gameplay feel balanced. 90% of the games end with 50+ cards left into the deck. too often you will have cards in your hand, but then can't play them because you draw a sigil for 6 turns in a row. the other thing that happens is that you only draw minions / spells, but no sigils. i hate winning a game for no reason other than my opponent drew sigils for 6 straight turns while i bashed his face in. i also equally hate losing for this same reason. the mulligan system will allow you to either keep or replace all of your cards which does not help these things from happening. if the developers will fix the sigil issue and cut the size of the deck by about 10 cards then would be a perfect game. the way the game is right now i would recommend it if you like magic as it's really close in gameplay or hate the other ccgs you're currently playing. you would be better off checking out elder scrolls legends because until this game is more balanced, esl is just a better game all around.",1

14531,"as of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. ill be talking about some major points.1: weapons2: types of t bots3: rewards after each match4: the matching system5: removed tech tree6: pilot seat removed1: weaponsthere are 3 major weapons i want to talk about. a: the worst one of them all, the rocket launcher b: anti-air c: shotguns.a: rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. to use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. one rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. it can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.b: anti-air guns, flak cannons. they are absolute cancer when it comes to anything that flies or hovers. they detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for mechs who jump or crawlers who jump too. they cost the least and have the same explosive radius as the strongest plasma cannons, which is horse crap. they do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.c: shotguns. these things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. they can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. they do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. they are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: bots. there are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. a: mechs b: box fliers c: helis with rockets a: mechs are t. they have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. the most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. these bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. you can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. you can have litterally everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. if you put pilots seats back, it would make mechs a lot harder to build and use.b: box fliers. these things are the absolute worst. they dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. they do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.c: helis with rockets. these things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by plasma cannons or sometimes smgs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: rewards. ok so, the rewards are pretty t, its chance. you could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. but if you get it, yaaay. you dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. i prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: matching system. they have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. a new player could buy the second strongest plasma cannon with ease, same with the smg. then refere to the matching system above6: pilot seat removed: naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot and give it the best fire power possible and it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get t one shot.some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. if a plasma cannon user came up against an smg user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the smgs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. i think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thosesummary: anything that flies is next to ing useless! rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size,

16911,"note: the game is in early access if you cant see,so if the game will come out fully i will edit this review and give my own opinion on full.witout further ado, lets jump ini would not recommend this game yet, it is in early acess, i came across a bunch of glitches that caused me to die norme off, so this game is pretty much a glitch mess 0/10 would not recommendglad you've stayed for more, i will be fair, glitches are common in games,the game takes place in what seems to be ww2, like other game gajin made, war thunderyou are spawned randomly, that means you dont get to jump out off a ready to eat chickens no! you just spawn, you dont get to choose were you get to be placed, which gives the gamerng, you can get spawned where alot other players are, or just get spawned somewhere good where no one spawned,the combat seems a bit ok, it plays like tabg mixed with any other common fps shooters, however sometimes you will get t kills or deaths, like killing a person at long range with a shotgun.lets talk about up's and downs shall we?+comedic gameplay that doesnt make you laugh, of course this is a parody, this is a parody of pubg, so you will have stuff like: chicken, pans as armor (not even kidding), and of course, sleepers that are rabbit styled that make you hiiigh+vehicles, i like them i guess, they are rare, alike pubg where you come across a vehicle and instantly win, and its actually funny how a game with a bigger map (the culling 2) doesn't have cars compared to this, vehicles consist of: jeeps and trucks.+nice graphics, better optimized and nicer than pubg, giving it a nice touch, here are some things: blur from the sun, forests, dynamic envoierments, realistic foliage, speaking of it when hiding in stuff like bushes they will bend, bushes, leaf's act realistic too!downs-t deaths, like this happened to me before making this review: i had a pair of bouncy sleepers, a guy in a jeep just tries to run me over, i managed to jump so high the vehicle was under me, i still died-glitches, they are everywhere, i gues.-clunky controlls, like you will have to stop moving or holding any keys to do something, like to open a door you must sometimes go to a complete hault before the door opens.-the houses are ok, except if you are in the top parts and you try to jump out of a window you cant, (i am talking about the bits higher than the 2nd floor lets say, all houses have atleast 2, even those which dont)-meele, you will die because some guy with a knife was 5ft behind you rushing you with a knife and stabbing you, not even kiddingso my final thoughts on the game? its bad in early access, i hope the game will fix some stuff6/10",0

4677,"i have played 3 moba games so far and i wasn't really into trying another one but recently i wanted to give it a shot since i heard about it a lot and got released on steam. i now play mainly hots and i love it but i will play smite as an off-moba sometimes cause it has some features that don't require me to invest time to learn from the beggining a new moba and set it part a bit from the classic strategy focused lol and dota. so if you too are heavily invested in a main moba, here are the reasons why you should play smite to blow off some steam every now and then. 1) it has 2 game modes that require no jungling or warding and it is just mindless massacre: arena and assault, mainly arena is the pure massacre with no real towers, just plainly kill each other. 2)it has the option to auto lvl up and auto purchase items, so if you can't bother like me to learn about new items and skills or whatever this contributes tremendously in just going in and kill gods, eventually though you will start wanting to purchase your own items since you will play enough to have the urge to change your build a bit. 3) it gives away for free some starting gods that are relatively easy and fun to play so no need to farm asap for your first god. generally it is a unique gameplay wise moba and the action based camera and combat have an amusing feeling. at first it will be hard to get used to the gameplay specially if you come from another moba game but eventually you get used to it and it is quite fun. if you are a starter on moba genre, i wouldn't suggest smite as your first moba as it is not a pure representative of genre nor as easy as the other isometric camera view moba games. it retains the fed concept from lol and dota but not in a terrible scale but the 50% of your hp-one ability concept exists. also the concept of fighting gods is really great and if you love mythology you grow a special feeling when you play your favorite mythological god no matter what his/her abilities are. smite's referal program is quite rewarding and by simply logging in every day in 4 weeks you get a free skin with the amount of gems they give. in-game currency progression is faster than lol's and hots's but not by far and the graphics are quite decent although they could use some improvement in some models, the environments are pretty great though. final verdict: try it if you have played another moba, come back if you are rookie after you have played another moba.",1

17198,it is a good game for the most part. but it could use some tweaks like lower the cost of fishing bait by a few gold (at least 1 gold) or making fish faster to buy then to fish for them cus having to waist saved gold to posibly catch a fish and not a god damn eal 75% of the time you find nothing but eal's or minnow's wich your dragons hate you for it or they only get one energy form the stupid thing. otherwise a great game i love the consept of having to actualy interact with your pet dragons altho some could use more then dragon nipp or a light to intertain there big friends.,1

5698,"excellent flight simulator. i have hundreds of hours on this game total, however switched from steam to the official launcher instead for better beta access and access to many more purchasble aircraft.some things to note about this simulator are:1) this is a flight simulator, not an arcadey flying game. there are options to make the game easier, but i have not used them so i cannot speak on how it plays with those settings enabled.2) as a flight simulator the learning curve is pretty immense. it takes many hours to get comfortable flying a specific aircraft and learning each specific thing it has to offer. this isn't even counting the time it takes to get used to the combat aspects.3) the level of detail in the clickable cockpits is quite simply, amazing. having nearly every switch and system functional is something no other game offers to the extent dcs does.i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, yet rewarding flight simulator. would not recommend to anyone looking for games like ace combat (nothing wrong with those games, but it's not a simulator). i would also recommend anyone seriously consider buying this game to invest in a decent flight stick, as you pretty much need it.",1
16194,"i'm going to keep it short:everything in one, this is a great game. wether if casual or playing for hours.but there are also some bad things about this simulation, but i'll mention that later :)pros:lots and lots of guns... and if i say lots, i mean it.realistic models (as far as i can say. i never operated a real gun)the first game with guns that's not about shooting. you can actually learn something here.good memory exercise.and it seems that everybody doesn't understand the dlc's: you can still get the dlc-guns w/o buying them. if you do so, you just unlock them instantly (i hope it's clear now)runs smoothly on low-spec pc'sit's free-to-play. if you don't like it, remove it and you wasted nothing.cons:the (dis-)assembly doesn't always make sensecredits are only purchasable with real money (except the 20 for spec-ops) or via making the daily highscore for this gun (might be hard, but possible)it's getting slightly repetetive after some time, until you get a new gun.i can only recommend it to everyone who ever wondered how guns work and not only to these people.",1

2447,"the only arpg to rule them all. can be a fairly hard learning curve. when you first start this game you either hate it or love it. it all really depends what kind of person you are. your first character will practically always fail, and 2 things can happen. you either get overwhelmed and can't get yourself to try again, or you can accept what happened and start up another character.(perhaps the same build tweaked or another one entirely) for strategists and rpg enthuisests this game is gold, over 1100 passive skill points to choose from with 7 different classes on the same tree. meaning that there is no right class or right build.(although some builds can be much easier/harder then others). a very unique skill system with an equally unique crafting system only makes characters more diverse with every player. if your skeptical, why not go ahead and try it, it's free and has no pay2win bs being shoved down your throat. if you love the game then you can buy microtransactions for cosmetic items, but isn't necassary at all. :)",1

14433,"robocraft is a really cool idea, build a vehicle from bits and battle it out. feels like playing with lego and pretending to have battles.. but for real. pretty great.but much of the fun is having pieces to play with, and being able to stick a whole bunch of em together. i do hope the devs read this, i know its one amongst the storm though.they have consistantly tried to monetize in some way, but i think have fallen short. unfortunately the easiest way is to put pieces behind some sort of pay wall, experience, credits, tech tree, whatever. as well as have some sort slow progression like we see with the cpu here.i understand the need for money, the game doesnt exist without it, but the way its currently set up is less fun than it used to be, to the point where i dont play anymore.if it were up to me, all default parts for free and charge for absolutely everything cosmetic, if that means premium to access cosmetic parts/paint or pay for singles, however. no levels, no tech tree, no crates, just big tubs of lego and a battleground, you want paint, or a fancy head or a flag or whatever, money. i understand many people enjoy the whole progression thing though so... not likely i guess. maybe cpu tied to level? fixes undercpuing with big parts against low stocked people but still provides a progression of some kind. then let me pay to max my level? i'd pay for that, wouldnt be pay to win because i wouldnt actually have any advantages over those people who didnt pay. (cpu matched against cpu, everyone has all parts) i'd pay for paint colors.. more paint options (seperate cubes into 4 for painting maybe) i'd pay to look cool, however that might work out. and i have paid to get through some of the progression, but again would appreciate a cut the leveling option and let me max out my level for 30 bucks, or 25 cents a level or something. i want to play the game-game, not mess around with everything that gets tacked onto the game as if its supposed to somehow enrich my experience.. tech tree/xp/levels, earning and shopping, crates.the problem is this.. right now i have a hard time recommending it to anyone, i dont anymore unless i think the game would really fit that person. when i have in the past, to everyone i could, they last awhile, but got tired playing with the same small pool of parts and small vehicles... for me again, building a big cool vehicle is at least half the fun, and blowing off large bits of enemy robots while bits of me fly off is up there too.. doesnt happen much at low cpu. i imagine retention of new players is on the lower side. maybe 20 or so gamer acquaintances have tried it, i thought most would like it... but only 3-4 ever played more than a few days, and only 1 other i think really got into it enough to spend a few bucks. maybe the devs feel like the game needs value, like if the parts arent worth anything, if players dont need to grind to build big bots, then the game isnt tangible enough or something? did they get a consultant or come up with the idea that if you dont value your own work no one will or something like that? i really liked this game, i probably spent as long playing it with the independant client as i have on steam. i would have spent more money on it.the recentish gameplay changes... im mixed on, variety is nice with the weapons, but there are valid issues with them i guess, never felt like they really ruined the game though... just changed things. not a fan of the single block choice now though at all. like more cpu but dont like leveling. auto self heal feels really wrong.i do feel like some of these changes were made for primary financial rather than gameplay reasons, whether thats attracting peoplem, i mean game needs people right, could argue thats gameplay but.. cmon... or encouraging current players to spend more. the crates drop thing feels like a total gimmick aimed at attracting people that play other crate focused games. its the crate thing that really motivated me to give a thumbs down and not play anymore. the armour thing.. i dont know.. ok? feels like a gimmick again with the rewards. i dunno, i dont have a real thought out solution, all i know right now is i want to play robocraft, but not this robocraft. hearing the same thing from the couple i know that liked it enough to play occasionally. so im not going to be giving them any money, or talking it up a ton... which i imagine isnt going to help the bottom line, and thats the whole problem here isnt it?i dont want to give this game a thumbs down, it deserves a thumbs up, it really does.",0
8313,"alot of people on here saying this is a pay to win game, but i disagree. ive played this game a long time and dont really feel the need to constantly spend money to get the best gear in the game, i play the game like many other people for the enjoymentand to help friends.having the top gear in the game would be nice but it definately isnt needed to get enjoyment out this game.all the people saying it is pay to win obviously dont realise that the people putting alot of money into the game actually helps you if you dont want to put any money into the game. its keeping the game alive, its allowing you to trade ingame currency (ad) to the premium currency (zen).just because you cant or wont put alot of time into the game doesnt mean its pay to win, and you cant expect everything to be handed to you on a plate you have to earn it.the main problem i have with the game is the constant requirement to grind out some of the content like with the new sea of moving ice mod they added recently, having to fish constantly seems like they picked one of the most boring less liked tasks within the game, changed it so it was harder to catch the fish and made it so it was mandatory to do, i think that was a big mistake,",1
8017,"just another voice to the choir. almost every negative review here on steam is spot on. if you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and i would recomend it. it's has great combat that is responsive and fluid. the quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).it's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game. this is where the fun stops. the end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the zen store that lets you skip them. yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns. think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game. that is just insane. keep in mind that it is only for one character too. those tokens are not an account wide option. so if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again. it almost seems like a cruel joke.on top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly. if you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money. i would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor. but now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment. all needing refinement to level up. if you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing. that is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the reagents needed for the upgrade. it's absolutely crazy. there is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.the other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes. neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update. i understand that this is needed for better game play. however as i mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it. when they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort. for example mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works. anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. that can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.so if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment. it's doesn't last for the end game. once you get to the end game i would recommend you move on to something else.",0

7181,"i've been putting off writing a review for this game for a while. i felt, as a tcg, in order to get an accurate grasp on the game i needed to play a lot. i've gotten to level 40 of 50, own all dlc, and have collected a good portion of the cards in the game at the moment. here are some notes:value. you do not need to pay a dime if you do not want to and you could (hypothetically) get as much out of this game as someone who pays to win. there is in-game currency in the form of both gold and soulgems; the former is used to buy packs, decks, dlc, enter drafts, ext. it can buy most things (aside from some promo content). you rack up gold just by playing the game, or even watching streamers play it on twitch. the soulgems are used to craft specific cards, allowing you to avoid buying hoardes of packs just to get a couple singles you are chasing. along side all of this, you now get daily rewards just from logging on, along with daily quests you can complete for gold. all in all, very satisfied with the ingame currency and microtransaction system used for this game; balanced, fair, and well worth.content. even though the game only has 2 sets out (excluding dark brotherhood and other promo/dlc content), the variety of gameplay along with modes of play is vast. it is a brewers paradise for constructed, and the draft system in great and very easy to get the gold to play. there are even quest story lines which implement various gameplay changes to make the experience feel unique and fresh. my only complaint with the current meta is it vastly favours the late-game. aggro is very hard to make work, usually relying on the other decks inconsistencies and luck. prophecies, while a good idea on paper, do not help with this, resulting in one of the only succesful aggro decks in competeitve right now to also bank on prophecies. hopefully in the future, as with many other tcg's, more cards will eventually lead to more viable early game and thus better aggro in the meta. for now, expect board wipes, ramp, and boardclogs.flavor. god i love the elder scrolls series and the universe it encompases. every card is beleivable in regards to tes lore and feel. if you like the idea of getting into a strategy card game and love tes, this is your opening.all in all, i like the game. i still think my tcg of choice is magic, but this still takes a good cut of my dedication and resources due to the uniqueness of it. very standout game, worth a few hours of your time to give it a try.",1

1975,"this review may cover both dota games, dota 1 and dota 2. dota 2, in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, dota 1. i have played dota 1 for more than 2 years before transferring to dota 2. however, i only played this game because i thought it was far better than the previous game.it is, but it's partly not. -gameplay-the gameplay is just like any most other moba games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. personally, i have been a fan of moba games back then because moba games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.before moving to dota 2, the gameplay on dota 1 is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and i got into it pretty fast. dota 2 on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. in dota 2, the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to dota 1 which requires right timing to actually execute a good play. but they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.not to mention, dota 1 needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in dota 2, its just download, install, and play.-controls-dota 2 basically has the same controls as dota 1, but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. you can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. back in dota 1, all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them. -community-well, its like in any other moba games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. but honestly, what really makes the dota 2 fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-other things-since dota 2 is a valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. the game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in dota 2 itself. (i still watch on twitch though.) with these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for steam wallet. you can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.also, dota 2 has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the dota 2 community.(back in dota 1, you can only download the maps made by others.) certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-final notes-although dota 2 is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes dota 2 itself. i mean, how do you play this game without players, right? even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends. dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.i recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/moba games. i guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring.",1

1000,"it is:multiplayeronlinebattlearena i will take it is a moba but doesn't have typical 3 lanes nor creeps. this is a battle of large capital ships. even though ships are sluggish at the begining, games are not so slow and usually last 25 minuts. game is built around team in mind in every aspect. to level up, whole team must take mining stations so entire team gets new level (ship upgrades). it is not possible to level up by killing ship but team with more ships get advantage - one player more means more firepower, more means to capture mines or infiltrate enemy base. technically, feeding is not granting enemy any direct advantage.ships do feel big and behave big. there are no plans to put in small combat ships - it is not the point of this game. every ship feels different so with every unlocked ship, player must learn how to use it properly. some ships have similar usage tho. graphics are great but it is in early access and some optimization is needed.there are no paywalls not pay-to-win mechanics. in store there are only skins and items that can be purchased for ingame credits too. note: skins can be purchased only with real money.game lack bigger player base. i hope it is only temporary thing as game offers really good fun.",1

14696,"it's been about a year since i wrote the original review. somehow just about everything changed and i still have the same gripes with the game i had back then as now. balance issues persist, drones still reign supreme over all other bot types, and matches still feature people who routinely disconnect and other network issues. meanwhile the main initiative freejam has taken on improving their game is to advance robocraft into 'beta' which apparently entails throwing everything relating to game modes out the window and changing the point of the game from destroying enemy bots to standing on rings, blasting crystals, and endlessly punishing bots with slow mobility. what's funny is that in the face of all that, they only slightly tweaked a few balance points about the more broken weapons and mobilities to be less outstanding (and to their credit, in response to a lot of player feedback over the past several months as well), but the rush and apparent decision to enter beta and somehow trash every single map they had developed for the game up until that point just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything and shifted the game balance even more weirdly off center.there's a ton good about this game - robot construction is flexible and stable enough to let players build in just about any shape or configuration and have a functional fighting machine. a combination of paint and various block shapes allows players to construct bots with legitimately pleasing aesthetics and just really cool shapes. the decisions that players make in setting up their vehicle carry over directly into gameplay as well, with the unexpected structural weaknesses and exposed weapons being prime targets for skilled players to shoot in lieu of 'headshots'. at its core, robocraft is a game with sophistication and reactive tactics in terms of how to fight with basic marksman weapons, and this is an element of the game that has thankfully survived intact ever since i started playing the game back in 2014 - when there were still cockpits and a weird tech tree. even with all the new weapons they're trying to push, my favorite guns are the laser (smg) and railgun (sniper rifle), which both emphasize careful aiming the most of all weapons. in terms of effectiveness though, ions (shotguns) and large plasmas (grenade launchers) currently reign supreme.with everything i've seen, i simply don't believe that's how freejam sees their own game. i still cite one of their mislead past decisions that thankfully didn't carry through - a recalculated damage system where it wasn't possible to damage components or immobilize enemies aside from just stripping off their whole chassis and vaporizing the whole bot. that was a decision that, if it had actually gone through, would've killed one of the main redeeming factors of its gameplay for me. reflecting on it, it really illustrates what i think i've come to realize, and it's that freejam just doesn't know what they want from their game, and still cannot recognize what they're trying to go for. it has no mission statement. instead, they are mostly trying to blindly follow the leader and seem to be focusing a lot of their attention on making the game more 'accessible' to a wider demographic. that really could just be what robocraft is, though. they might've just sat down one day and said 'what if we combined minecraft with world of tanks?' and somehow it worked for about 2 years. with how much i do like the game's potential, though, i really hope this isn't the case.",0

17354,"this game is awful and i really like it.--> don't spend money on it there's multiple accounts of people getting glitches that involve losing items/gems. <--it's really glitchy, there's almost no actual skill, strategy, or puzzlesolving. almost all the quests are fetch quests with poorly written dialogue and an inconsistent objective arrow, and there's not nearly enough quests to keep interest. the only repeatable quest takes about 10 steps and gives you 5 gold, and once it's completed it will likely restart itself against your will. the main form of earning cash in the game is a time-lapse farming game and once you've gotten a stable farm there's no point to earning gold anywhere else.the only real gold sink is randomly spawning chests that will give you cosmetic items for your farm and, in theory, dragon eggs.the game plays primarily like a walking simulator with a dozen or so islands for you to explore that are completely undecorated and uninteractable beyond berk.-the glitches-the glitches are plentiful and fantastic. the game often takes multiple tries to boot at all. walking through walls is easy and common. falling through the floor is common. i've had the fishing minigame refuse to quit so i was trapped fishing eternally. my pigs live underground. they had to recently update it to avoid letting you multiply your gems. 10% of the farm quests have typos that make images not load. farming pumpkins causes explosions of produce. the best way to get exp in the game is to afk. dragons are stuck in t-pose half the time they load.-the censor-numbers are censored. words related to censorship are censored. words related to being lost are censored. cursing will give you an automatic mute. the chatroom has formed their own language to slip past the eyes of the everpresent robot dictators. everyone is roleplaying toothless and seasons have to be misspelled to be spoken about.",1

9407,"product received for freeas a beginner in this game i found it extremely hard, with the removal of ammys and addition to pets it didn't make it any easier, in my opinion the ones that has the hardest time in the game are beginners, sure if you have been putting in hours on hours on the game you deserve to be powerful right? yea that is true but as a beginner you die from taking 3 shots from a ghost god in god lands, and someone who have been playing for a while, your 8/8 with a max legendary pet, you can be afk in godlands, and the only hard content for us i would say is the lost halls, where everything can oneshot you no matter what you do, thought i have not tried much of the new lost halls i've heard it's still very hard. shatters are becoming more and more of a joke. bring a friend along or two that are pretty experienced in shatters and you can do it in like 10 minutes. when i first stepped foot into the shatters i got jumped by an ice sphere and i died. which also turned me away from the shatters for a long time, but now it's a joke. everything else is not even worth doing cos it doesn't give you anything cool. tombs are a great source for life pots but the rings are extremely inferior to shatters rings. ot sure the bow is nice and it's pretty easy for mana but like mana is pretty easy to get without an ot. the epic dungeons doesn't really give much, the leaf bow (how much i love it) is basically worthless. the doku has just a slight higher dps than the normal top-tiered katana. the cutlass barely exists. the only thing that are worth doing are the events that either deca puts out, or the realm events (sphinx, lotll etc.) but the only reason you want to do them is for that minimalistic chance for a white bag. but with all this why do i find the game fun anyways? well it's not really fun but you often have a reason to play! died recently? well you need to fill up that character with another maxed character. want to get higher than red star well go out and try out some other classes than knight and wizard. most classes are really fun imo. you'll never know which will be your favourite one if you've only tried 2/14 (soon to be 2/15 hype). well try the game out, but ill warn you, it's fairly addicting and extremely hard as a new player!",1

10111,"love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. i would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. it is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. with that being said, i'll continue with why i love the game.it is an excellent pay to play game and literally the only online game i have subscribed to aside from world of warcraft when i was younger. me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. this helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. this get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. i've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.i also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency em$. aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. you can also earn em$ by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an e-mail. i've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although i have spent real money on the game, if i really wanted to, i could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment i wanted.finally i'll talk about the dev team. with regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. new areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and i can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games i've ever played and although i hope they change their pricing model some day, i'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.edit: also i should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). the first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. if you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours i have in the game so i'll explain why i have so many. if you leave the initial thehunter browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. i leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so i can get the latest news they have updated the game with. so if you think it's sketchy that i have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because i leave the main browser open.",1

1100,still alpha but lots of fun - surprisingly free of bugs and some awesome graphics. it is demanding on machines but if you are running graphics cards from 2012 and beyond you should be good.online play only at the moment but it gets very competitive and the battles are versatile.,1
13456,"first off, i think the positive reviews are either made by people who dont mind being misled, or sheep. as soon as i started the game, the only thing i could see was the bottom half of the game window on the upper half of my screen. did a search for the problem and came up with this... it, its a bit old, and to be honest i didnt pay attention to the date of the post. so anyway i created a dummy world to fix the screen problem. lo and behold on a free account you can only make one world. also you cant delete that world, nor the character you made, nor can you do much of anything. to be able to do all i just mentioned, you have to buy the $20 version.now i have no gripe with that. these guys obviously should be paid for their work. my problem is when you advertise a free game and instead of offering a free game you offer a free demo. thats what you have here, a demo. you cant edit any of the rules for your world. best you can do is reset it. which by the way does nothing for you if you created a dummy world.just know what your getting into. i admit i did not research the aspects of this game enough. i also admit these guys dont make that info available on the store page.",0

8871,"you need to try this game just for its legit unqiue experience. i've never played or seen anything else that provides an fps experience with hundreds to thousands of player combatants present. there's no npcs. its much more like experiencing a real(ish) war. the massive scale vehicle battles in particular are things you just have to be there for.that said, its a cruel game. time to kill is on average less than a second so its high lethality. you'll die a lot and often in bitter ways. however, the kills you do get are gonna feel awesome. its not a newb friendly game and your mad fps skills won't help ease that much. pro tip: get in and use the social tab to join a public platoon. strength in numbers is vital. running around with a group of experienced players will definitely get you the best experiences ps2 has to offer. run around alone and you'll probably just be wasting your time.public platoons are very forgiving and nice. you don't need voip to participate, you can hop in and out as you need and no one will care. just make sure to stay with the group. no one like a squad-mate who runs off alone all the time.",1

7682,"do you like adventure? do you like to explore huge worlds? like fighting monsters to gain loot? like fighting other people around the world? do you like clubs? do you llike dragons? if so this may be the game for you to play.pros: (1.) great visuals/graphics in game. (2.)this game is great for those who like adventuring games and for those who like competition games. there are in-game modes, such as pvp or shadow towers. (3.) explore new worlds taking on new dungeons and as you level up your character level and gear you can go to higher and tougher difficulty worlds getting access to worlds with gems (to further upgrade your character's stats) and new items. (4.) daily challenges to earn rewards and do dungeons to earn rewards and loot. (5.) make your own club or join other in-game clubs, start gathering materials to make your own legendary dragon mount, or take on shadow towers to get lots of loot. (6.) the trove devs have life streams on twitch, if you have time watch them to gain knowledge on upcoming updates or changes to the game and if your lucky enough you may win really rare in-game items or mounts, such as the rare legendary bird ganda. (7.) team up with others to make your game easier. only downside is how the devs keep changing the game mechanics, this would become a great game if they minimized making frequent changes (most of the changes in-game become beneficial to you) cons:(1.) many people who have played this game may agree that they have experienced this while playing this game. which is known as lag. this has been a problem for awhile in trove. even after some patches and fixes some people still continue to experience lag. if you do not like lag this may not be the game for you.(2.) there are some toxic people in this game who may target you for being a person that has just started the game. expect some people to say insults to put you down.(3.) there are also scammers and spammers in this game. they seem to offer you a good deal but once you hand over what they want, they will either not give you anything back or give you something you did not want.(4.) the game does have major updates once in a while and can impact your gameplay. some people dislike this.(5.) the game over time has become more of a pay to win game. this had a negative influence and is drawing some people away from playing the game. (ahh did you miss the free items we gave back awhile go? guess what you can still get it by paying real money for it!) (oh do you like this? well you are going to need money for it). for example, characters previously were able to be bought with in game materials (it was very easy to get more characters), but now you have to pay real money to obtain classes you don't already have or you can make the classes but that requires many materials and that brings up the next con.(6.) grinding/farming. this has become a foundation for this game. this annoys many people and may be the reason why the person does not play this game. if you want to become at the top of the game you are going to have to go through this. want to reach the max level? guess what you are going to fight enemies for a few hours just to level up once. want a mount that you like? you are going to have to spend some time getting the materials you need to get it.information:(1.) trove does not offer refunds for things bought with real money in game. you could possibly get in contact with them.overall still a fun game to play despite the cons.",1

11444,"well, after some time playing this game i can say that i enjoyed it most of the time. don't expect sometnig new from it, we've seen everything it has to offer 100 times before. tdm maps are mostly small, and designed for fast and agressive cqb, even if all of them have some kind of a sniper-designated area. demolition/assasination/battle modes maps are a little bigger and will give you some breathing space. not too much though. the real problem of the game, is the lack of a new content. i mean it's in development, so it has to get new stuff regulary, right? i was playing it for a year or so, and all new stuff i've seen was 1(one) new map and a sh**load of skins for guns/grenades/melee weapons. i'm an occasional player, meaning i can play 1 or 2 matches a day, sometimes not playing for couple of days at all, so i'm not too bored yet. but if you going to play it more often keep that in mind. still, the game is well balanced and polished, it's fun to play. i'm an aggressive submachinegun-runner type of a guy, so it'suits me well. also a good thing is they don't lie about pay-to-win, real money won't give you any kind of advantage, all of the guns available for bullets(real time money) can be bought for ingame currency that is earned really fast. so, in my opinion it's worth a try, it's free after all.",1

177,"after seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,i wanted to make a review talking about what a great horror game this is.first of all,it's free.i really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.karamari hospital (the dlc) costs just under $6,but if you enjoyed the game i would recommend the dlc.now,i'm gonna get into the main review.the game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.the game doesn't feel like it stole these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references.1.if you find jump scares scary.get this game.2.if you are unsure,try watching markiplier or someone play it,that's how i found out about it.just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises.3.i found i rarely died from enemies,but that was because i was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.time to talk about the enemies!!(i won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(possible spoilers)specimen 1.the main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,i began to fear them more then the actual enemies.they jump scare you,but the do it all the time,and it's terrifying.specimen 2 and 3 chase you around,they aren't the scariest.i skipped a bit of the game,(i'm gonna replay it all soon),so i missed the specimen 4 and 5 parts.they still look spooky though.specimen 6 is well...the bane of my existence.specimen 6 is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.his death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of zelda references,which i quite enjoyed.just,when you play the game,be ready for specimen 6.specimen 7 isn't really scary.but it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters much harder.specimen 8 is the deer god.things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then 8 shows up,and the terror begins.although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.specimen 9 randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.i have never encountered him before,[spoileri] he re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.it is fun,and similar to the ganon battle from loz:ooc.[/spoileri] specimen 10 is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.i don't entirely remember him,but i remember he is very hard to run away from.specimen 11,who i refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.i remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe i was just nervous when i entered his area.the area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.there is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.specimen 12 the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.it takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.it was very fun,and scary.specimen 13 who i call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to kaernk from 'amnesia:the dark descent'.you must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.it was really fun,and the area before was very scary.that raps up the review of the monsters,but i have a few more things to say.1.the game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror.2.the game has a lot of references,which is one of the best parts of the game.3.this game is terrifying.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :3)i would definitely recommend this game.10/10",1

8013,i've just recently came back to neverwinter because i was missing a mmorpg with good story and questing. there is alot to love about this game. the fighting mechanics are fun. the graphics are not bad. all the quests are voice acted. so many mounts and companions to get. so many races to choose from and classes to play. the leveling is fast. there are dungeons to run. there is someting going on every weekend. you don't have to pay money to play and get items if you can't. most cash shop items end up in the auction house. if you have the time and no money you can still get good mounts and companions. there is so much to do in this game i felt overwhelmed when i started playing again. i recommend joining a guild using the guild finder menue. now i have other players to help me when i have questions. the guild stronghold is great. your guild gets it's own instanced keep and town with mobs to fight. everyone is leveled up to 70 in the sh so you can join in the events even if you are a lower level. random events happen in the sh area all the time. if you are a small guild you can alliance with bigger guilds and go to their sh and partisipate in the events with them. give this game a try. it's free to play so why not.,1

16758,"i really like this game idea and how it plays out, a ww2 weapon selection with men in boxers running around using kitchen items as armor while trying to kill eachother for no god damn reason. now you might be asking bat y da negetiv revijew? lemme tell ya... first of all, this game comes bundled with this bootleg netagent gaijin, it's an app that i was 99% sure i did not install on my computer before. now the big offender here is... it's useless, and this is actually the only reason this game made me give it a negative review. more about gaijin now.this software does nothing in particular except say hey i'm installed :d it also creates this taskbar shortcut on the bottom right which you can turn off, but it will almost instantly reactivate itself, it also has no uninstall option. i went ahead to visit their website and appearently this is what the software is doing will immediately install itself as soon as you download a gaijin supported game. will automatically update the game even if the computer is turned off. (this is pointless, updating takes 20-40 seconds) uplaod your game data to the devs for some reason. share the game data to other computers to automatically update the game.now i have a lot of questions for this, now let me get to the what i suppose to be the frequently asked questions.1. what do you mean share my game data to the devs?- it takes your game data and transfers it to other computers for auto update.2. what's so bad about this?- this software without any permission uses your bandwith, which is just pure malware.3. why doesn't my antivirus say anything about it?- because i don't really know, stop using norton.all in all i would rate this game as nice in 7/10, but putting this into their game just turned into a spyware game, you get fun but you lose all your credit card information. not really if you have any questions, go to the review discussion -rust",0

9027,"construction is stupid, new weapons are broken, implants are broken, new server was handled poorly. older development team was better. bring back lord higbylet's get one thing very clear first and for most, jumping into this once excellent game, it's gonna be filled with fully decked out veterans on every front. so expect to die a lot within the first few hours of playing this game, no matter where you go. however, it still fails to quell the satisfaction of saying 100s of players a side trying to duke it out over a single capture point for the deciding base in an alert, which could turn the odds of winning in exponentially in your favour.however, this game is far from its glory days of the past, where i feel that questionable design decisions have been made in order to improve this game. i've been playing this game ever since its launch and i have seen how this game has grown under both in population and in standard under its previous developer soe. during this period, it truly felt like this game could be something unique. the ambitions of the old development team were high as they pushed out new weapons and a new continent as well as the user cosmetic system. i have seen my old server, briggs, grow from just a few hundred players a night, to well over a few thousand, all occasionally clashing in on one base simultaneously. it was during this period, where for me, even dying a hundred times over made the game experience a lot more endearing.once the new team, daybreak, took over however, the game was quite literally flipped on its head. with the old team, you could feel that they were trying to make a good game, but the new team just feels like they are trying to make a quick buck. first off, with the current construction system, it feels a lot like just filler content for the rich and real-money spenders to get a couple of kills with a nuke, compared to when it was used as tactical objectives. the nuke never really contributes anything tactically towards turning a battle in your favor, other than holding the enemy back for a brief period. next, with the introduction of the newer ns weapons, which are more powerful than faction specific weapons, its giving people more incentive to not use their faction specific weapons and playstyles anymore, as anyone who does is basicallyon by an ns weapon. third, the current state of the implant system is basically broken right now, as there are only 2 real implants that are actually useful in the current meta. if you don't have either of those or you aren't a heavy, you're basically out of luck in almost every one on one. the worst part is that you can buy implants with real world money, which gives 12 year old rich cry babies the ability to go on killing sprees without having to do much prior work!!!the one thing i can commend the new developers for is the introduction of the newer server for the asian region, allowing a large proportion of their players an opportunity to play at a lower latency. with the introduction of this server, they gave veterans the opportunity to transfer their characters to soltech, all except briggs. so, those of us who have dedicated thousands of hours on briggs, had to basically kiss our progress goodbye!!!the culmination of all these design decisions on behalf of daybreak, have driven quite a few of its veterans away, almost 7 8ths of a server population in some cases. plus, it fails to give newer players an incentive to keep playing this game. add that to an outdated, soon to be updated (hopefully), graphics engine, i could potentially see this game, which still has so much potential, eventually dying out before it has a chance to fluorish.",0

14455,"product received for freeearly access reviewtl;dr: another veteran gets rambles on about the good ol' days of robocraft, and won't be returning even if they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.i have another ~200 or so hours on their launcher, as well as the 410 hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in early access. meaning, i've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.thing is, i can remember a time when i first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. however, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. this was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. just simple tdm all day every day.then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. so much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. spiderbots. spiderbots everywhere. sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but i remember more spiders than them.this was about the time i left for a few months, and came back to find megabots. oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. the megabots before the epic up with fj were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. the art bots i very much enjoyed were very squishy. the reason why was very simple: each block had different hp, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to nil if blown up. another way to drop the fps was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. the more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.that was a fun time, and i really do miss those days. what with grinding for tp (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. then grind for rp just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. that's right folks, i said tier, and there were 10 of them, 11 with megabots.each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. there was no wait ten seconds to be instantly healed, only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. sure. there were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the mega and not your sorrythen came the pit, which was okay, i guess. never really got into it, and still don't. would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. however, they had their own set of problems. such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. there was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. i'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.afterwards came challenge battle, but i'm pretty sure its referred to as battle arena. again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. this also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. where one team with superior firepower would farm the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. they wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around reddit with this.really, though, this was a fun time to play robocraft, until the majour up everyone knows about. such as the removal of tiers (big mistake, fj), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called battle ranking. went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. then again, i stuck around just to see what else they did.what did they bring? why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of megabots. i love megas, and had two; one smg and one plasma. i miss them both, but fj doesn't want them, and if they say no, there's not a damn we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.folks, the thing is, i'm not going to recommend this game to anyone. if you want to try it out, go right on ahead. the game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying cs;go and other first person shooters with their loot crates. not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on reddit after all thispopped into existence. if they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. they've ed up real big this time.ps: at the time of this review, i've about three months of premium left on my account.",0

13118,"fun game but it is yet another version with another save file... (android, ios, bethesda launcher, windows/xbox and now steam)the problem i have is not only for saved progress which if you spent many hours on one platform is a pain to start over but also, if you bought something with real money on one of those versions it doesn't sync.many apps already do the sync well with a code or an external login so why not after all this time?now the game itself is nice with a lot to do, and they keep adding to it. you can play casual or hardcore. hardcore in the sense that if you're not looking at the game and your guys die you cannot res them so you do have to pay attention. if you play casual mode you can pay and resurrect your people. so if you like to leave it open while you do something else play casual. if you can focus go hard it is more challenging and more rewarding.the packs are not necessary but very useful to make life easier.",1

3969,"team fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.the heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. the soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. the demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. the pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. the spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. his sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. the scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. snipers snipe from far away. medics heal and make people invincible at times. as for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. the more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. if a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. it is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. there is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like king of the hill). teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.the newest mode is mann vs machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. there is a free version of mann vs machine called boot camp and a non free version called mann up that costs a tour of duty ticket ($1 in the store). the ticket gets used if you complete a mvm mission. if you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. a mann vs machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. what do you get for completing a tour? a random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!the maps in team fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. there is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! hats for $5, keys for $2.50. keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! there is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. the game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. that's the basic free currency of the game. when you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. you can also buy and sell keys in the steam market for steam wallet money to buy steam games.the items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. so it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. it is all rock-paper-scissors. heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. a pyro can easily take out a spy. stuff like that.team fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and halloween events. the halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just halloween versions of normal maps. the community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. there have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.it is an exceptional game. diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!! free!!! you get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. it is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! or single player against bots! it is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. the game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. there is a diverse array of modes.",1

6447,"english/german reviewenglish:the m1/m2-carbine is totally unbalanced and gives the us-faction a tremendous advantage.this weapon can be modified towards an extremely high rate of fire with nearly no recoil through weapon modifications.thus it shoots faster and is more stable than all machine pistols and thus much more useful in close quarter combat.in addition to this overpowered status of the weapon itself, it has a very high number of reserve magazines at its disposal.the two other factions have no comparable weapons in their arsenals.a post in the forums, to point this unbalance to reto (the devs) out, got closed without any comment ( ) .that is a bad service and thus i can't recommend the game at this time.german: die existenz der total aus der balance geratenen m1/m2 carbine gibt der us-fraktion einen ungeheuren vorteil.diese waffe kann mittels waffenmodifikationen auf eine extrem hohe feuerrate mit so gut wie keinem rcksto modifiziert werden. sie ist damit sogar schneller, stabiler und im kampf auf kurze distanz brauchbarer als alle maschinenpistolen.verbunden mit dem absolut hohen munitionsvorrat ist diese waffe total aus der balance, die beiden anderen fraktionen haben keine hnlichen, starken waffen.ein forenpost, der reto (die entwickler) auf diesen missstand hinwies und der eine korrektur anmahnte ( ) wurde kommentarlos geschlossen.das ist schlicht ein schlechter service, daher kann ich das spiel zur zeit nicht positiv bewerten.garman-update:english:they still didn't nerf the carbine.they reworked the maps, they're definitely better now.but the new spawnsystem made tactical gameplay completely impossible, more details here: in all, the game became even less fun to play, so i still can't recommend the game.deutsch:der m1/m2-karabiner wurde immernoch nicht generft.die maps wurden berarbeitet und sind jetzt deutlich besser.allerdings hat das neue spawnsystem ein taktisches spielen, insbesondere flankieren, unmglich gemacht, mehr details hier: in allem macht es jetzt sogar noch weniger spa, das spiel zu spielen, ich kann es daher leider immernoch nicht empfehlen.",0

9323,"when talking about planetside 2, the discussion eventually becomes what's the point? and then a whole intervention is staged and we all ask them to go get help and we're all very supportive and in the end it all turns out that they meant what's the point of doing x in planetside 2? whoops.i may sound like an old war vet, but planetside 1 had a lot of nice features that people refer to as meta-game that planetside 2 seems to be missing.ps2 is a perpetual war: three distinct factions with their own pros and cons are fighting over the planet of auraxis and its many continents. what's the end goal? me if i know. the continents are filled with many bases and outposts that you must take with your faction. when you take that, you move on to the next, and the next, and the next... and eventually the enemy starts pushing back and you lose all those bases you just captured. it's one giant tug of war with no end. even if you take every possible base on a continent, the enemy factions have permanent footholds on each continent, so they can just push right back with no reprocussions. ps1 had more than three continents and each faction had one permanent sanctuary on another island rather than footholds on each landmass.there may be about 50+ bases in the game but it feels like there's only about 5-10 different base designs. even though this game is still under constant development and base design changes are made often, they still feel like a patch job rather than a permanent solution... but to be fair, the original only had about 1 with very minor changes in between, but still...however - ps2, as a free to play fps, is very good. (especially after the optimization update!) the community is also really great, and i reccomend finding a good outfit to play with for the best possible experience with this game. there's nothing like joining a squad of other players to give the push you need to get to that second base, or to that one point, or even to own the skies and destroy the ground. the mmo of this mmofps really shines here. you can sometimes even join a group of random people and use the ingame voip to really getdone with perfect strangers who just happen to wear the same colors as you.if you're wondering about the ability to pay for things, it's a bit all over the board, but mostly good. all weapons can be purchased through in-game cash, but those weapons can also be earned just by just playing and earning certs. players can't buy upgrades for their classes, they have to earn those (but they can pay to earn them a bit faster.) everything left over is just cosmetic.but hey, it's free. play it. try it out. no harm to you. just give it a shot and you might enjoy it. if not, uninstall and go back to whatever you like.",1

15277,"the game is terribly unfair and really picks its favorites. it always selects someone to be the lucky winner and another person to be the terribly sorry loser. i had played quite a few matches with friends and most of the time i was selected to be the loser (by the game, that is). no need to say i didn't enjoy that. it's not like i'm paranoid for thinking that - like my friends who were winning thought - it's totally the oposite, because when it was my friends' turn to be the loser, they started noticing a pattern too: some people simply have lucky rolls in this game for no reason and the same goes the other way. you don't roll physical 3d rendered dice, instead, you click a button and wait for the game to do its thing. i can't say i trust that. the rolls were so predictable, me and my friends started guessing the next rolls and we would mostly be right about it.its pretty much random how it selects people, i was just unfortunate enough to be selected several times. its rgn system is completely broken and who knows if that really was what the developers had in mind. if it was, i can say it was a terrible decision. it makes no sense to be like this. it's not fun as soon as you know you will lose. who'd want to play like that? (the developers, maybe)rgn aside, this game has some other flaws, such as the trouble that we must go through if we wanna play with friends. sometimes the steam chat invite doesn't work, some other times it does. some people can host rooms, some others can't (and like the winner/loser pick i just mentioned, it also changes between players). you are always designated one of the 4 random colors (red, blue, green and yellow) at the beggining of each game and can't pick your own color (but can pick between 4 different characters), which at first might not seem so bad, but when your game doesn't have a quick replay option in case you want to play again with the same settings, it gets mildly annoying to say the least. you'd have to leave the match you just finished just so you could create another one from scratch and invite your friends again. when that happens, you'll be assigned random colors again, which really messes up your brain when you want to identify your friends, based on the last match.this game is not very user friendly, but made me and some friends kill some time, but i still can't recommend. if you wanna get a good board game video game, get tabletop simulator. that's the definitive game in this category. go there and play some monopoly, whatever. it's not such a good game anyway...",0

(so the dtm and adac gt experiences.)all the content i own i got on sale and i got dtm 2014 and wtc 2013 for free! i won these through the free competitions that are held in raceroom. they cycle through these competitions around each month. some are just for bragging rights and some have rewards such as the in game currency (vrp), game content, or even real race tickets.i have all the other big sims and i like raceroom for providing content that the other don't and also providing real race series with the tracks they race on. you can compete on the leaderboards with real race drivers in the dtm and adac gt series and they even host races with them from time to time.i definitely recommend trying it out and seeing if you like it. if you do, i suggest waiting for one of the sales either through raceroom or on steam, like the summer sale :).",1

10504,"wife is away for a few days... 45 hours into thehunter in 3.5 days... first look tl:dr - i can only hunt 2 things unless i get a subscription? *** that noise! put some effort into it, and click a couple things. that's not how it is. for more info, read the first section on what's really up.the real tl:dr - it's a hunting sim. if you like hunting, nature, and an experience that directly rewards you for the effort you put into it, give this a try. it's supprisingly addicting, fun, and rewarding.***my impression of the economy in the game, and possible solutions for you thrifty spenders who don't want a subscription;this game is not what i would classify as f2p. the game you can download for free is basicly a demo that still allows you to interact with other people online, and experience a good scope of the game. you only have licenses for mule deer, and cottontail rabbits. you won't be allowed to shoot the bunnehs with the rifle they supply you with though. even if you don't invest a single penny into this game though, i prolly spent a good 20 hours hunting mule deer with that free rifle alone. so why not give it a try? (you have unlimited ammo for that rifle)want to hunt the bunnehs too? for one single for all time investment of $5 usd(from henceforth, all money i list will be in usd. for you gbp, euro, and other users), you can get 500em$ of the game currency. you can get a shotgun for 450em$. while ammo for the shotgun won't be free like the ammo for the rifle, you can still get the ammo for free for some time just from playing. accomplishing missions(read 'tasks') will earn you gm$ which can be spent on various consumables in the game, like ammo! (em$ is the premium currency you have to buy with money. gm$ is the currency you can earn from completing missions in the game, like take down a 6 point buck. em$ can purchase anything, while gm$ can only buy ammo, wind indicators, scent eliminators... consumables) as a guest(free player) you can still visit and explore every map on the game, and play with other people. however, mule deer can only be found on loggers point, and whiteheart island. the cottontail rabbits can be found elsewhere though. you can earn em$ from participating in our sponsers activities. i gather that's a lot of surveys, and emails you can direct to a junk email account. not worth it imo, but that option is there if you want to earn premium currency without spending money.the wayfarer starter pack is $14.99. it comes with various items, but most importantly weapons. it gives you a 3 month license which provides you with licences for all animals in the game, and unlimited ammo for all guns. it says basic ammo, but the only 'non-basic' ammo there is are the tracer arrows. it also gives you a shotgun, and a .357 pistol. you now have the ability, and weapons to hunt everything in the game. $15 for 3 months... most mmos cost that for a single month. it get's even better than that. it's actually only $9.99 for a 3 month membership. that's $3.33 for 30 days... that sounds pretty cheap to me, but i do completely understand not wanting to pay for it at all, so read on for ways to work around that!don't want to pay for a sub? not a problem! you can actually buy licences for individual animals for pretty cheap. say you can only really play on saturdays with your friend. you can pick up a 24 hour license for any animal for 45em$. that's 45 cents if you buy the cheapest money pack. the larger bundles are better values. $4.99 for 500, $9.69 = 1000, $18.69 = 2000, $26.99 = 3000, $43.99 = 5000. so say you get 2000 for $18.69(be honest with yourself. you've spent more on crappier games. it's like the same price as a craptastic meal for you and your sweetie at taco bell). you now have 2000em$, and a 24 hour license is only 45. that's almost a year of saturdays worth of games with your friends. you can get a 7 day license for 95. you can even buy licenses with gm$, which is the money you can earn in game. you can now take your free rifle with unlimited ammo and go hunt other animals.*** my actuall review :)i think it's a great game. i do think it's being marketed poorly. it really isn't what i consider a f2p game like they are trying to list it as. a lot of people, including myself, saw that it was restricted, and required money to fully unlock the game, and said bs, i'm out of here. read the above. it's cheaper than most games you prolly play.this is a sim. this is not doom, or any other shooter. running is this game will only assure you that you never have a chance to shoot at anything, if you even see anything. slow and steady wins the race. or slow is smooth, smooth is fast, or (enter your choice here). it's all about the hunt. i spend most of my time tracking and stalking my prey, just to line up a single shot. they did well to make the tracking not be tedious, and there's always the suspense of not really knowing if your prey is on the other side of the valley, or around those trees.the envrioments are amazing. the trees look and move like trees. even the bark looks like bark, and holds up to close examination. the lighting is superb. the way the sun filters through the trees, and the sunrises are beautiful. i've found myself just wandering through the massivly large expanses of the maps, just enjoying the views. it's the closest you can come to experencing nature without getting off your lazy rump. check some of my screenshots or any of the others people take. it's a beautiful game.there is character progression. it's not an in your face tech tree. your abilities increase as you play. as you track an animal, your ability to track that type of animal becomes greater and easier. as you fire your weapon, you progressivly get better at handling that weapon...there's a decent variety of weapons.*rifles - take your pick. like the surgical precission accuracy of the .300? the hard hitting power of the 9.3x62 anshuitz? maybe something vintage, like the famous k98 from all your ww2 shooters. perhaps even more old school, like a 50 caliber muzzle loader. there are many to choose from.*shotguns - shotguns your thing? dig in! extremly versitile with your choice of slug, buck, or bird shot. they let you hunt every animal in the game with a single weapon. come in a variety of styles for your needs. pump action, over under, double barrel, single shot, or the semi-auto 20 gauge to paint the fields red with pheasent blood.*pistols - everything from the .22 for varmint hunting, to the .357, .308, .44, up to the .454 raging bull*bows - yep, has them too! popular compund bows with high tech, auto selecting, range finder sights. precision readiness of the crossbow. classic styling of the recurve. then there's the classic, 'true hunting experience' of the longbow.all the equipment and supplies you can think of, and would want for your style of hunting. tents, blinds, stands, towers, bait, decoys, scent eliminator, lures... the also have numerous styles of camo and outfits for your practicle or stylish needs.20 different animals to hunt. twenty! small and ellusive like the rabbit and fox. kings of the forrest like the moose and bears. high climbing antics of the ipex. the petite roe deer, up to the massive red and reindeer. even ground locked and airborn birds, like turkies and geese.the games market is compartmentalized. you invest as little or as much as you want into it. at 9.99 for 3 months, it's one of the cheapest subscriptions around. and if you start playing less, just pick up a small pack of em$, and only pay for the days you want to play(at .13-.45 cents per day).try it for yourself. download the game for free, head into logger's point, and start hunting mule deer. the community, for the most part, is very friendly and willing to help new players learn the game. this is suprisingly awesome.",1
18143,"this comic reminded me of when i got my girlfriend into wow. she wanted to actual experience the game instead of get power leveled so i just came around or explained stuff when she needed it. when she got to outland (this happened during bc) she messaged me saying she was getting ganked by high level players a lot. i offered to baby sit her but she was to proud for that, but she was getting frustrated.sooo.. i stalked her character on my druid and flew high above her, and the dude who kept ganking her finally showed up. max level paladin. for some reason he was on his ground mount. fire the drop bear. (druids could turn from birds to bears and use their charge ability while falling to take no fall damage and just immediately appear on the target and root them for a second) he died in a few seconds because i'm guessing he was a fresh 70 and i was in 4 pieces of bt gear. i went back into flight form and flew back up and as far as i know she never knew i was there.",0

9212,"planetside 2 is one of those games with an unusual combination of genres. however, it works in this game's advantage, because it is worked out really well.coming back to my point earlier, a fps mixed with a mmo isn't the combination you think of when making a game. or it is, but very hard to work out. planetside 2 did this very well. there are 3 unique worlds where you aim for domination by claiming land as your own. there are also 3 teams/replubics who are part of this battle. in short, only 1 world already contains thousands of players, duking it out to be the victor. that is just so much fun and works correctly.there are 6 classes to choose from, so you can choose the character that fits you the most. your class has different weapons and styles depending on the replubic you choose. this also comes in the form of varying vehicles, which also work very well in this game. there are both land vehicles and airplanes, and both are easy to handle once you get the hang on it.it will take some time before you have built your character with customizations and weapons, but trust me, it is definitely worth it. and if you're not sure about what weapon to choose, you can hire them for some time or test them out for free as much as you want in the training section.there are 3 worlds in total. one being indar, the kind of desert world. most of the time that world is also most crowed. on the other hand you have esamir, the snow world. this one is usually the most quiet. and finally, there is amerish, which is a jungle world. this one is mixed on people.there is one negative point that i also have to mention. that one being character customization, which is not or almost not part of this game. everybody looks the exact same depending on your class. you are able to give you armor and weapons several colors, but this will cost you real life money, and it is not worth it.planetside 2 is definitely worth checking out. i would advice picking this up with friends though, because it can be a bit boring when you go alone.",1

4570,"probably greatest online multiplayer arena ever. the setting (playing as a deity, god) may be questionable, acquired taste or a weakness for the antics, but honestly that really doesn't matter much.what does: no grinding, no leveling needed. jump in and go. 15..60min for a single match depending on game mode and teams. levels are used for matchmaking purposes only (or a status symbol). skills still matter a lot - knowledge of your own god and opponents, field control, team work, etc. matchmaking is working fine. as a lone beginner you won't be thrown in arena against a pack of teamed up old wolves. amount of active players is huge. each battle is started at zero. all equal - same money, same items to earn in a fair fight every single time. you can't take anything over to the next fight - except fighting spirit, your experience and a great team if any. item choices are large enough. you may specialize in speed, critical chance, damage, health, defense, regeneration, mana... you name it. thats on top of your basic skills and character preset. i would recommend starting with something that supports your own personal playing style. two players may play the same god (opponent team) but most likely will do that more or less differently. find your own style. items are meant for action but probably even more - reaction (to the choices of opponents). it does work. team work. at some point you will notice what a great difference it does. you stun, your mate does area damage and someone finishes the runners, or all ultimate attacks at once on a whole enemy team, or... there are a lot of choices to be made and profit in a team. rude teammates are more like an exclusion. at the start there will be too few to worry about in a random match. at higher levels/competitiveness they will be your own regular teammates more often than not. no paid freemium bonuses - you may buy all gods or additional skins anytime, but you can also quite easily earn any of that for free within just a few hours or just by daily login. to earn all would take quite some time of course but all gods are also on a weekly rotation for a free play and i doubt you will play or even like all of them. i have started smite 3 years ago in open beta, paid some 20 eur because i loved the concept and the work done by this team and still get all the new gods for free.whats not to like? probably some gods or skins won't be your favorite ones but with the 75 gods (different playable characters) out there at the moment i doubt you gonna miss some of them due to your own preferences.enjoy fair gaming.",1
14206,"at first, i didn't understan why so many people hated this game.when i first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.i entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then i thought: well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. right?no.the tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.okay, maybe the character animations are good. i said. nyeti took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. but then i pressed shift. you break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing olympic swimmer. the sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.okay, once i find some itens, it'll be more fun.neini wasn't able to find any items because i was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. well i say, at least i'll respawn instantly.nieyou have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. if you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-echhhjust thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. you have to use... in... game... currency...at this point i'm so fed up i uninstall it as fast as possible.1000/10 would uninstall again.",0

12010,"if this mmo had been released in 2008, it would of been a below average mmo of its day, in 2018, it is a very poor addition to the genre. they have designed a game without any forward thinking, or even what works with classic mmos.having some great features that work in other games may help, but forgetting to include ancillary systems leaves them dead in the water. it is hard to believe how bad this game is, with so much money invested into it and how long it spent in development hell. the engine is so dated and is not at all optimised, so much so, that even with this game, with graphics that look like something from about 12 years ago or more, after setting everything to minimum (1), it still stutters and drops frames, showing how little love or care was put into this game. compare this to bdo for graphical fidelity and performance, the difference is night and day.leaving that, and the game place, spending the first 10 mins in a game like this and you will start to know if you will hate it or at least like it a little, this game was unintuitive. play any game from warhammer online, wow, etc. and you will straight away be able to jump in and start messing about, but with this it is clunky.i could go on about some of the other systems that they have in place, but, i think you get the picture, i was looking forward to some fun but i found none here, i would advise others to look elsewhere too.",0

3238,"so, after 35 games, how does it stack up against favourites like pubg, h1z1 and last man standing?pretty well!there's even a backstory; you and a bunch of other tourists get stranded in a winter landscape. a resuce chopper is coming but only has four seats... and the freezing blizzard is closing in fast. you gotta secure a seat on that chopper, whatever it takes. yes more than one person can 'win' the round by escaping in the chopper, although obviously its a 'shoot first ask questions later' mentality as per all royale style games.graphically its pretty decent, very similar to pubg, and gameplay is about the same as well. weapons and loot are well distributed and with decent types available there's something for everyone. m4? check. mp5? check. mosin nagant sniper? check. desert eagle .50? check. silencers, scopes, grips and healthkits round out a good compliment of weapons and armor, and 'supply drops' give extra special loot for those willing to risk running for them.the thing that makes this game different is the class types - you can choose a hanglider at the expense of less carrying capacity, a snowboard for fast downhill action, or a simple climbing pickaxe and zipline - not as fast but a great tactical option, plus you can carry more loot. the class types are pretty cool to use and great when you find the right circumstances to use them. you can rush someone below you with a snowboard, travel from the top of a mountain with the glider, or run down powerlines with the zipline - all great when used to their strengths and a good change from the standard 'hit shift for sprint' mentality of most shooters.weak points are few and far between, with minor things like running through an open door and attempting to close it behind you often sees you stuck on the side you just came from - you must stop, turn around and close the door to prevent this. no big deal. what some may find annoying is the intrusive anti-cheat software which (as of writing) forces you to turn off any system interference - this includes software overclocking utilities like afterburner. yes, i am forced to turn off my gpu's overclock... but i don't care as i havent encountered a cheater yet. thankyou tencent!if you're wondering how it plays on lower-end hardware, i'm currently playing on my backup rig which is a pentium g4560, 8gb of ddr4 and a gtx960 2gb card. nothing special, but it nets 80fps+ easily with standard settings at 1080p.matches boot quickly and are fun to play, this is a title to watch for sure. highly recommended for fans of the battle royale genre, or anyone who is just over dealing with pubg's issues.",1
7267,"a game i tried desperately to like and simply cant, legends feels very much like a cash grab by zenimax. nearly bereft of innovation, legends is a trading card game. cards range from common to rare to epic to legendary (skipping uncommon) because...that's how hearthstone does it. crafting costs are exactly the same as in that...other game...except for a slight discount on legendary cards despite being able to play 3 times as many of them per deck, for the most part.decks are 50 cards and playsets are 3 of for...reasons. apparently, not ones related to either mathematics or common sense. despite an additional 20 cards in the deck however, starting hands remain 3 cards. because...well, you guessed it.for all its carbon copying of...that other popular card game...legends does offer one interesting mechanic all its own (or, well, almost all, anyway): lanes. in what is perhaps legends singular fit of innovation, the board is split into two lanes. one lane plays normally, while the other grants minions cover (stealth from hearthstone, without the spell protection) for one turn. that the game utterly fails to capitalize on this single innovation should come as no surprise. lanes exist. some cards let you move minions from one lane to another. which sometimes nets you...maybe +1/+1 or a card draw. for the most part, though, games will focus on whatever lane the first minion is played in while mostly ignoring the other, because lanes were a poorly thought out, poorly implemented and large pointless add-on, likely shoved in at some point because its vaguely similar to gwent in some way on some marketing report somewhere.couple this clumsy, poorly thought out, copy cat play design with a ui that is an insult to the eyes - half cloth fantasy map and half electric blue star trek lighting, laid latter atop the former - and the game is as painful to look at, as it is to play.my advice: avoid this. its clunky, poorly designed, poorly thought out and keeping up with new releases is quite expensive. so dont bother. stick with card games that will still be here in 12-18 months.",0

10293,"in short, a great hunting game with lots of variation in both huntable species and weapons, if you are willing to pay for it, and quite nice graphics even though it has been out for some time.many complain about the subscriptions and costs of the game. i feel it is not so bad compared to a lot of other games that costs much more in total, especially mmo's with higher monthly subscriptions and so forth. i played the free version for almost 7-8 months before i got my first subscription and even though at the time you could only hunt mule deer as a guest i did not grow tired of it. get a membership bundles, extend with the normal subscription and you will be able to hunt every species for a very reasonable price. i personally like the slow pace of the game with the thrill of never knowing if the next animal will be a new personal best. there are a lot of competitions and missions available if you want some direction of your play. note that special weapons or equipment might be needed for these. the scenery of the reserves are beautiful and there playing multiplayer with some friends while chatting is really fun.if you like these kinds of games, give it an honest try and you will not be disappointed.",1

1525,"i have jumped in to capture the valuable mining structure for my team. i am the first one here, no allies to back me up, no enemies to contest the point. good, because my hull is already down to less than 50%, and my targeting system had been damaged so my lasers won't hit anything anymore anyways. i begin capturing the structure. halfway through the process, an enemy ship jumps in. not a single scratch on it. i am doomed.i position myself behind the structure, the other ship has no clear line of fire. my only hope is to hide, conquer the point for my team and escape. the enemy is bringing the ship around and i suddenly can relate to the rebels on yavin iv as they watch the diagram of the deathstar moving into position to blow them into oblivion. the point is close to being conquered and i initiate the jump, hoping that i will stay long enough to finish capturing the point but not long enough to... get hit by the swarm of guided missiles that is now headed my way! the enemy has brought their ship fully around and i grind my teeth as i anticipate the deadly impact as-zappi am back at motherbase. i must have missed the missiles by half a second. i check the map to be sure and the point is ours. i sink back in my chair in relief.this has only been my first match.",1

14618,"this game is terrible. i have over 270 hours of game time, so id know. myself, and many others, loved this game before. however recent 'updates' made this game awful. items started costing millions, you made 90% less, and mega bots were removed. but wait, theres more, now its a game of chance for what items you get, new players have no chance. you need to spend hundreds to even have a chance at some good items. also. if your not premium, you get half as much. the grinding after lvl 100 is unheard of. this game used to be my favorite, then maximum loadout came, then 90% nerf, then my megabot i spent hundreds of hours of grinding dissapearing within a week of getting it. also the devs hate everyone, they only want money, not good gaming expierences. so dont bother recommending things to them. if you dont have this awful excuse of a game, dont get it. if you have it and havent considered unistalling, i dont know how. so if you dont have a free 100 hours a week for video games, or are prepared to spend hundreds, its useless. rant over. going to play games that accually provide entertainmentupdated review: ive went back to the game for a round just to see what its like, here you go. spamming automatic lock on weapons seem to do more damage than full plasma bursts which require alot of aim. every bot can have every weapon so theres no need for medics, snipers, tanks, or team play at all really. im not sure whats going on with maps but the last few times ive played its been the same one, and its quite boring, you just dont get the robocraft feel anymore. this game is literally going backwards and its peak was 2014-15, strongly recommend not installing this game.",0

9581,"realm of the mad god is an amazing game. i could leave the review there but i won't. this game might appear to be one of those games that you play once and then forget about but if you actually give it a try it is ridiculously addictive. it is easy to pick up and heaps of fun to play with friends. realm is a perma-death game with some things that carry over between lives. these things being a currency which is only earned when you die, your pets and any items that you leave in your vault. with a change of developers, lots of free stuff and new content coming in, now is the perfect time to start playing. with the new developers (deca), we can expect frequently monthly updates and changes to the game keeping content and gameplay fresh.this game is one of my favourite games to play. my steam client says i have about 60 hours on the game but my main realm account runs on a different platform and that one would show you about 1000 hours.honestly this game really deserves the recognition of the haunts my dreams steam award because it will encompass everything you think about in you dreaming and waking thoughts.",1
10650,"this game strikes an exciting balance between the complexities of games like magic: the gathering and the accessibility of a game like hearthstone. i'm a huge fan and have gladly put money into this game to support it's development, though you definitely do not have to in order to build up a collection - even with three total sets out!pros---+ easy to get started, accessible to new players+ provides good f2p value - it may not seem like it at first, but once you start rolling through quests and doing gauntlet and then forge and gaining ranks in those you will realize how much the packs and shiftstone (crafting resource) add up over time.+ short queues - i play at all hours of the day because of the mobile app and average a 20-25 second wait time in both casual and ranked. this might change as you get higher mmr.+ strong community - there is a tournament series (ets) and some pretty great community websites. the official discord server is active, and the websites rng eternal and eternal warcry are great to help out with determining which decks to work towards+ drafting - actual drafting. you pass a pack, pick a card, pass a pack, et cetera. barrier to entry is low, skill ceiling is high. when you start building a collection, this is actually the most efficient way to collect cards (assuming you have mastered both gauntlet and forge already). simply draft all the rares and build the best deck you can after that. sometimes you end up going 2-3 wins or even more, which is just icing on the cake since you keep your cards and get the value of opening 4 packs.+ strong playstyle variety - i'm not talking which decks are tier 0-1, i'm talking about the different styles of decks out there. you can comfortably play aggro decks, burn decks, midrange decks, combo decks, and control decks. there are viable lists out there for all of these playstyles. there are even options within those options. right now there is a control deck that plays zero creatures. there is also one that relies on developing control of the board and then dropping an overwhelming force of high value and hard to remove creatures.cons--- the tutorial is ing long - honestly, just power through it. it sucks. it's way too long. we've all done it and it's not fun. but once you finish that and all the modes and options of this game open up to you, it suddenly becomes worth it.- operates on a mana system like magic - this means you can get games where you get flooded or screwed. games where you draw nothing but power or don't draw any power really feel bad to lose.- deck size is high - this is debatable, and lsv, one of the designers, has stuck by the decision to keep the deck size at 75 for constructed. it introduces some variability to the game and makes it harder to consistently draw the answers you need.",1

3045,"where can i start with war thunder? well, i'll start with the basics. i stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. when i stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. this meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. what this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. now, you have this 5 tier system, which is no other word for it, it's just seeing it on steam, i redownloaded it and played in what is now called tier 2. what happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. this means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. for instance, you could be in a bi-plane just out of ww 1 and someone in a mk 1 spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. i really did love playing the short time i played. don't get me wrong, i loved it! but the problem is, i can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't thinkthrough. i cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. if you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. it's f2p and good fun and the start. but after the 2 hours i played it as a tier 2, i cba with war thunder anymore.",0

7614,"this game, although being around a very cube-like style like other games... (minecraft, cube world, etc.)is atleast 85% different and unique in it's own way. here are some pros and cons.pros* there are many classes to chose from, ranging from a flying fairy-like woman, to a barbarian that wears and uses candy as a weapon. * there is an rpg aspect to the game, having to mainly break through dungeons and beat bosses to earn loot. you can also goto a city of neon lights and ask around for quests (from different creatures around the city) to earn points and things you can use in some shops to buy items.* endless fun. this game has so many things to do in it that it's to the point of almost endless gameplay. there are so many classes to level up, there are mastery points which can be earned to get a mastery rank which can get you cool prizes. there are club worlds you can make to hang out with friends or build, there are hundreds of styles of clothing and costumes for your character, and so much more. i can't even start to explain everything.* not 100% pay to win. there are alot of things that you can buy easily, but can craft in game with just more difficulty.cons* some things are a little too pricy, and can't be crafted in the game. (have to spend money on game if you want to get something fast, etc.)* making progress starts off easy, and then becomes extremely hard. making a learning curve that exponentially increases but sudden decreases at high rates, making you want to quit the game and not come back for awhile.* options have no graphic settings, making it hard for slow-computered people to even play* even while using a good pc or a good ps4, this game still lags a ton and can be quite annoying.* cool things take extremely notice i said extremely long to get if you don't want to pay for it.",1

4602,"this game is continuesly compared to league of legends and dota 2, and for good reason. though generally looked at primarily as a league of legends clone, smite actually takes a different approach into game mechanics and especially p.o.v ( point of view) where as league of legends and dota 2 work out as a more linear top view design, smite does in a third person persepective where you can see the areas around your god. now for the game mechanics it's pretty straight forward with w, a, s, and d as your movement keys; 1, 2, 3, 4 as your skills; mouse 1 as your attack and mouse 2 as a cancel key; and e, and f as your relics. like league of legends and dota 2, itemization is key into first learning how to play and the roles are pretty similiar( in the competative level; a solo laner( usually bruisers), a mid- laner( usually a mage/ range champion), a jungler( usually an assasin type or tanky and can initiate), an adc/apc( generally range champions but can be magical damage based as well), and a support( generally with hard crowd control, peel, or initiation/ disengage). the community may not be as big or as widespread as others it is compared to, but the one it has is strong and continues to push updates, patches, and changes ( mostly positive) to the game as a whole and i wish it continues to do so as hirez ( in my opinion) does a good job in making sure the community interacts with its developers. overall i'd give smite a 8.5/10.",1

(here's some food for thought: whose worse? cryptic for buying the rights to an damn good series, or obsidian for actually selling it to these shmucks?).where do i begin... i remember downloading this game for two reasons, and two reasons alone: one was so i could play with a friend (this didn't work out though), and two because i wanted the right to rip this game a new . so let's begin, shall we?now i want to begin by game play... ever played champions online? what about ddo? if you played both you're probably nodding your head. basically, cryptic took the play style from both games and smashed them together repeadtly. if you don't get what i'm talking about here's a good way to describe it: hit m1 a lot and use wasd. that's about it, you spam the button and then your character does stuff... yup. you get some abilities and you can press buttons and there is some skill trees like they have in champs but it's mostly like ddo.speaking of the champions online relationship... i must say cryptic, you gave me quite a laugh. one of the first missions of them game was to help soldiers that have fallen. the hilarious part is that they reused the same help! i'm a fallen soldier animationf rom champions online. you click a body the same type of interacting bar comes up just like in champions. now i know it's not fair to compare this game to bethesda games but let's take a look at fallout and elderscrolls. notice how yes they are indeed very similar and they run on the same engines... but they still put an effort to make a very different game. the animations are not the same, the skills are entirely different from one another, even the textures and models for characters are quite different despite the fact that they use the same face slider. they went out of their way to make a difference. these guys? hardly. i laughed even harder when i saw nwn2 icons reused for this game. the word effort is not in cryptics vocabulary clearly. i haven't played too much of it but it wouldn't suprised me if they blatantly reapplied stuff from their other games to this current. oh wait they already did. some of the hairstyles used from nwn2 are altered/make a direct reappearnce in this game. effort please?moving on from cryptics more than apparent lack of effort... the story is terrible and i hate all the characters. you will too. i don't have too much to say on them other than it's dumb, they sound dumb and i tried hard to ignore what they were saying after the first person spoke. yeah it's bad. i'm actually horribly bothered that this game thinks it has the right to be considerded a sequel to nwn2, which was a mediocre game. championswinter nights: online is a game, to put it bluntly. you're better off not wasting your time with this. instead you should see if you can get a copy of neverwinter nights: diamond edition. one of the last few good games that bioware had ever made before neverwinter nights and bioware both got molested by bad companies. this game is a symbol of so much bad i could almost cry.-2/10someone please buy the rights to neverwinter nights from perfectworld/cryptic? you'd be doing a good series a much needed favor.",0
4241,"do not play this game. the game itself is really amazing, well done and really enjoyable but konami really failed this time. it is free and this means that you can play without spend money and this makes your deck's building time extremely longer, i spent personally 30 days (playing hard) to create my free deck but the point is that for this kind of deck you need skill. you can get the skill by defeating the legendary duelists in game. now, after 49 days of duels vs legendary duelists with a very high average of scoring point 7-8k (8k is the max), i don't have the skill yet... and it is not buyable or obtainable by increasing lvl. moreover, the ultrarare and super-rare drop rate is ridiculous, even scoring 8k of duel points vs a lvl 40duelist. i scored the max a lot of times and i've even not seen a single super-rare/skill for the most of times.people play the game to have fun, for hobby and to pass a good timec.. in my opinion, 79 days to create a deck (and i am work n progress) are definitely too much. is not fun anymore.moreover 3 packs cost 2.29$ and every pack contains 3 cards (for the digital cards is insane) you cant even buy the exact card or skill. konami should increase the drop rate and the skill obtaining process to make this game consistent and funny. i kown their aim is make moneys but this make the game annoying. you spend money ok = create more deck and faster, you send no money = no competitive game (ages of tme to create a consistent and effective deck)just to let you know my stas up to date: 79 days of playing (most in android), 3824 duels, almost 20k of diamonds used for deck. > (no skill?!?! seriously?!?!)",0

8270,"just started this game today and to be honest i wasn't really impressed. so far it's not really a bad game per say, it's just it seems so... dull for me. the action combat isn't all that actiony. not like other games such as dragon nest or tera.for me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. neverwinter simply did not thrill me. i dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. what is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? combat seems very clunky. i stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, it's just not for me.on top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily pay2win as levels progress. while i may not have witnessed this first hand, i have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. boss mechanics consist of mostly cone / aoe then spawn adds. repeat process as difficulty increases. really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. check youtube videos, it's obvious.don't get me wrong, while i may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put me off from the game. there are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. while it's obviously harder for them, if you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. it's just annoying how much of an advantage paying does give you. overall i think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an equal f2p experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else.",0

8877,"planetside 2 is one of the toughest games to review. the sci-fi theme is rooted in a lot of 90s media and aesthetically superior to most futuristic fps games, held down only by f2p items and inconsistent faction variation. the gameplay is reminiscent of older battlefield games, just on a much superior scale. outside of that franchise, there's so little competition that planetisde stands out even with many glaring flaws. providing a slow burn with teamwork and co-ordination valued above any silly k/d stat, perpetual war means little downtime, and hours can be soaked up. i wouldn't really call it immersive but as platoons are large enough to consist of combined arms fronts one can take position in all aspects of the war experience. the four main continents upon each addition started dividing up the player base , so they eventually (finally) added continent capping to keep it to only two continents, one with actual battles and the other with ghost capping squads. additional server mergers helped mitigate a loss in playerbase and server biases towards certain factions. this is the only f2p game to my memory i directly spent money on so for all i can say, the cosmetics are overpriced. back in 2013-2014, they ran a month long sale in december where their chosen cosmetic or weapon was dirt cheap. i would say without any doubt the game was not p2w, but so much has been added since i stopped playing actively in 2015. the new implant system is both limited and potentially too rewarding for those that luck out in rng, but less annoying than the old limiting system. additional disappointments include an overall graphical downgrade (old high is new ultra), questionable content upgrades, and a dev team that's missing the real spark the og team had. i enjoy the larger facilities but fights seem increasingly focused around fun points instead of them, with a huge lack of major facilities, cities or fortresses.indar stands out as the best map, with iconic points, three unique biomes and objectively the best vehicle and infantry fights. gun play is wishy-washy, some providing a satisfying dink, others feel floaty. medic and engineer provide mmo grinds for xp if the forces killing you in battles seem too external. sadly, this game is dying and i don't believe market trends or daybreak games can save it. issues preventing this from running on toasters already hurts much of the potential f2p market. all in all, few games have the true wow factor or give me a desire to learn everything as does this game. remember to live free in the nc, and bring many friends or find them quickly, as only a few grunts won't provide a major difference against a trained platoon.***endnote***there's no way in hell this game is pay 2 win for any combat purchases. if you're whining about having a terrible k/d there's no reason why the carv, saw or orion can't carry you. git gud or shut up. my k/d shot up after making sure it was only using raw input on my mouse, turning off smoothing/vsync and lowering my sensitivity to a fraction of the default.",1

13460,"building:pros:the building stuff looks nice.it's easy to place blocks and rotate them exactly how you want them.cons:the blocks require too many materials, even for basic blocks like windows or fences. it's not inherantly expensive, just annoying.combat:pros:none that i can think of.cons:really janky.enemies have no telergraph of their attacks at all.there is no way to block or mitigate damage, so you just have to constantly circle strafe and/or backpeddle to avoid taking damage.no sound or flash effect to notify you when you've connected a strike.monster spawns are entirely based on light, with not even a safe zone around the player, so if you are walking in a dark cave, monsters might spawn literally on top of you. (or, y'know, an almost-fully-lit-up cave, keyword almost)crafting:pros:it's cute and simple.take a thing, shove it into a machine and it cuts it up, or cooks it up, and then you come back later and pick up your finished thing.cons:extremely gamey recipies. a level 4 diamond digging glove takes diamonds (ok!), pristine feral pig skins (???), ice cubes (???) and some other stuff. why? because those are all tier 4 materials! many other items have similarly stupid and pointless reagents needed, for gamey reasons!too much stuff, too little inventory to manage it all.exploration:pros:the built-in map is a nice touch.teleporters are easy enough to make, and there is a player waypoint touchstone which you are given for free, that functions essentially as a spawn point and teleport locale.caves are large and vast. it was not often that i explored a cave in it's entirety.cons:not much to explore? the surface had perhaps 4 or 5 biomes total. grassland, forest, canyon, snow, and... maybe one another? maybe there were more, i don't know, i never found them. i explored quite a bit on the surface for a good 2 or 3 hours, and i just found these same 4 repeating over and over.the caves weren't much better, since it was entirely 100% layer-based. between 0 and -25? surface caves.-25 to -50? stalactite caves.-50 to -75? lava caves.-75 to -100? corrupted caves. yawn.no structures, no nothing worth your time, unless you like looking at large and empty caves full of infinitely spawning monsters.- misc:multiplayer was easy enough to do. i just started a world, and a friend joined me right away.physics are kinda jenky. sometimes monsters would 'pop' really high into the air and then fall down. sometimes **i** would fly into the air when placing a block, killing me.not really a fault, but i felt like the cash shop was too in-your-face too early. before i had even gotten in-game the very first time, i was bombarded by the cash shop suggesting i buy stuff. maybe hold off on that stuff till the 2nd launch, maybe?overall, it was not that fun of a game, but at it's current price of free, it was worth the cost.",1

6361,"heroes and generals is now out of early access, so lets take a look!excellent foundation, good technical achievements, incredibly poor design choices and missing management.that about sums it up. but lets elaborate on that.the foundation of the game- the battles themselves as infantryman are good. vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal. the physics and gun system are good, once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game, and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs. but then there are things missing, and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for. prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective, and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point.flanking works well, you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms, but this is not really used that much. you can use it all, be the ultimate soldier, and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets. there is no penalty for dying- not for you at least, but more on that later, and you don't really get rewarded for anything you do either. you play to play, and you win because you want to win.then lets get right to the poor design choices. this game is not just pay to win, but pay to progress. the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game. do you want to group up with a few friends? if there's more than two, then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the 'skill' of having a group. after that, prepare for a lot more grind, as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier. and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades, you're going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications, because every single bullet shot, grenade thrown, mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot. this leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentality;life is cheap. ammo is expensive.if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because 9 times out of 10 it will be better than yours, even if you've spend 50+ hours on the game.of course there are other issues, mainly around balance and the 'generals' portion of the game. i'll spare you the complaints on balance- it's the usual for pay to win games, but more on that other bit later.that said, if you don't mind the grind, and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours(10+) the basic infantry combat is good stuff. moving along to tanks you will find that they're not amazing, but certainly entertaining and useful. your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well. airplanes are a joke and they likely always will be, do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them. controls are awful, planes don't do anything, and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful. prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything.and then on to the big complaint with this game, when you're not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money. the generals part.it may as well not exist.the game may even be better if it did not exist.the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable.first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it. then you will need to spend 3+ days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them. they will die in about 5 minutes and they will have gained no experience. everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the devs money for it, which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them. the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy- merely people throwing their units around hoping it works. sometimes it does work too, but this is never because of any skill at command.it all comes down to the people playing the war battles. and they don't care. people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at. because they don't have to pay for those tanks. the guy who got the tank brigade does. same for airplanes, infantry spawns and vehicles. why would they care that you've waited 3 days to get your infantry squad filled? they will run into machinegun fire and then respawn to do it again until you lose your squad. they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have 1000 infantry spawns and 300 vehicle spawns and they fight 160 infantry and 10 vehicles. and because these vehicles despawn after use, they are gone and they remain gone. the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics, a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game.and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun. a game with great ideas, pretty good technical achievements, but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesn't care either. greed above all else, and a complete lack of awareness.long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept, good basic gameplay, and claimed to have plans to make it better. i wanted to support them, since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great.i regret that.i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use. the game isn't better than it was back then. it's worse, and it's showing no signs of ever improving.",0

no. and neither do you honestly so stop creating the idea of lazy company. wants game to fail. they spent over a literal ton of money to port the game over to the western servers and they are not going to sit by and let the game crash, or at least if they are smart they wouldn't haha. the game had launch problems... what game hasn't? more closely, what mmorpg hasn't? especially kmmorpgs. hell we can look at american made games too, it isn't just the asian mmorpg market. you know that really big mmorpg that everyone is hoping the next mmorpg kills. that wow game that every mmorpg is compared to. i know a lot of you are probably too young or just didn't play computer games then. but that launch? much worse than this game. hell we can come to a more recent date even. anyone play wow wod launch? the servers were down for a week for their more populated servers, so educate yourself before saying the server stability for this launch was bad. that can be drawn to many reasons but people aren't arguing the reason. they are only arguing that it happened. this is one of the smoother launches for mmorpgs that i've every experienced. now could it have been smoother? yes. they ed up thinking that their servers could hold that many people all logging in at the same exact time into the game. they should have started with 5+ servers and then cut them down as time went on or something along those lines to make it smoother and keep a nicer image of their company. but they didn't and it made them look lazy and stupid. i won't back them up or say people are wrong, the servers werethe first 2-3 days but they have fixed a lot of the issues revolving around with not being able to even play the game, so just give it time as far as optimization is concerned. if that's why you left and refunded or if that's what is keeping you from getting the game then don't get the game. wait. if you really want to play it but are scared of that, just keep up to date with the game. stay active in the reddit, read reviews. formulate your own opinion based on the game from the reviews. see if the negatives outweigh the positives you're concerned about.now to the point of making your own opinion. there have been a lot of videos from youtube content creators constantly bashing and destroying everything about this game, names like cryy, lolhero, lazypeon, gaming lighthouse and many more i'm sure. they are given the right to feel how they want about the game and for the most part, every point that each of these videos made was 100% accurate, i won't discredit them. they got to where they are now for being pretty transparent, but just remember. they aren't you. yes this game has flaws, and yes it has too many issues that we should not be okay with in 2018. but look through all of the information presented to you, don't copy opinions based on what one person you've watched for years says. my friends (that have never played the game before, all from wow) all got the game early access. they saw those videos and guess what. they still play the game, because while those videos had a lot of truth behind them, my friends still enjoy the game. yes it has flaws. but it can still be enjoyable if you focus on having fun and not on attacking every negativity. now maybe you do that and still don't like the game. then walk away, refund it and you're good. don't come back, don't constantly keep going back totalk the people that are enjoying the game. you only make yourself look like an even if you feel the need to voice your opinion, it really isn't needed. be happy with your money back and enjoy life, don't stress over a game you already quit. lol.apart from the rant, obviously there is still blind fanboyism and with reason. i absolutely enjoy playing this game. the leveling is fun to me and has been on every re-iteration of the game. the taming system is addicting. the crafting system is an easy but fun grind. gathering to max level gathering is addicting. i actually feel like i'm going somewhere everytime i get a drop unlike bdo. i played bdo for a significant amount of time and yes getting that one boss drop was exciting. but short lived excitement... i never felt stronger until i spent 2 months grinding the item out to tri. this game has a different gear system so it isn't a fair comparison, i'm more comparing the feeling of gearing, i actually feel like i'm getting stronger everytime i get a drop. going form green to blue. from one blue drop to the next always makes me feel like i'm progressing and i'm not even +ing the gear yet. tl;dr ... yes the game has flaws but it can still be fun. give it time to get better or play now. your decision. i love the game and i'm going to continue to play it. :d",1
6653,"great game actually, concept is awesome especially the 'war mode' where factions take part in seasonal battles for control over a country spanning real world time that it would take in real life, giving everyday a feeling of another day in war for the bigger picture. the only problem is that this game is honestly broke as 3 pcs over 3 years each pc better than the last, and this piece ofgame still has a problem every time. if only devs who actually made the game working (i say that because just google a random problem for this game and there are more message boards than marvel movies) instead of veteran status and warbonds and silly, totally ridiculous buy your own everything and fight for us microtransactions. yes i know it is free and they need money too, but let us think its our own idea, dont force it upon us like some type of ww2 dictator forcing ideas and beliefs. so, overall, a cool game. more than cool though sadly. like taking a crap from a moving car on a highway but rapidly turning into an offramp having yourfly high speed back at you smearing your neck in something you do not actually want to touch, and if it had a name, it would be 'heroes & generals'",0

12474,"full of exploitersuntil this has been fixed won't be bothered with this game because when we play online or try the leader boards the times are set by people like him.below was my recommend review, unfortunately the leader boards still haven't been fixed and the below review was written on july 8:th 2015...potential raceroom racing experience has as a lot of it!the game is great and simulates the cars close enough, or what i'd recon at least, there are a few things missing, but more on that later. the races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer. the setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy. these cars, which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome! hats off for near flawless multiplayer code! the free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars. there are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to circuit de barcelona-catalunya and the other a more narrow circuit similar to circuit gilles villeneuve both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every corner!i've yet to try the get real difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars, but i do hope there are some pre-sets to chose from. the jeoff crammond grand prix games didn't have and see where that lead them... there are however some problems with the game. the first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least, no need for me to dig deeper into it, read the other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content.the actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line, and i'd like to see different type of weather too, like rain for example. the leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some short cuts invalidating the lap. a reset of the leader boards should be done asap! sector3 studios are working continuously on the game and with that in mind and seeing the potential it'll bring raceroom racing experience very far!",0
4648,"does smite need any more word-of-mouth than it already has? probably not. but i'll throw in my two cents into the well anyway.before i even mention anything about the game itself i want to talk about the community that plays this game... word here is toxic. absolutely vitriol and toxic. so much anger and hatred is oozing from the vast majority of the player base polluting what could be an otherwise enjoyable experience. 9 out of 10 matches will devolve into a shouting match like the screenshot above. and this isn't even a smite problem to be honest, it's mainly a moba problem and the type of games that just attract this sort of crowd. be prepared to be yelled at, a lot. oh and yelling isn't even the worst of it. also be prepared to get reported. there's nothing more sore losers love than to press that report player button after almost every match. this game is not friendly to newcomers.with that out of the way i guess i should touch up on the game itself. it plays like any other moba out there; there's towers, minions, jungles, and an hq. but what makes smite stand apart from the crowd is it's unique perspective. instead of a typical top-down moba view smite will have you play via third person. so instead of having your camera roaming all over the place at all times you're invested in your character at all times. it's a nice breath of fresh air from the typical formula.now there is one final thing i wish to address before i call it a wrap here: loot crates. that god awful scourge that's rotting the gaming industry down to it's core. smite is waist deep in loot crates. granted it's not pay-2-win because everything is purely cosmetic. but with that said the prices are outrageous. the chests cost 400 gems or $7.99 and usually have 55 total possible items in it. the catch? only 5 to 10 items in said chest are skins (that you probably actually want) the other 40+ items are generally stupid emotes or other worthless trash you don't care for. so think about that for a moment, $8 emotes, how do you feel about paying $8 for an emote? someone who spent nearly or over $400 on these damned treasure chests i regret every moment of it and wish i could take it all back. sure i got some of the skins i wanted but more often than not it was some lame avatar or emote i could care less about. and so i had to buy another loot crate until i got a slightly more favorable outcome. it's gambling, it's gambling at it's worst. and they make this problem a whole lot worse with exclusive and limited content. it's all about that buy mentality and falling for the hype and the marketing.if you're sitting here and debating if you should give smite a try i'll save you the trouble and suggest you look elsewhere to spend your time and money. but if you absolutely have to play this game be prepared for the toxic players and the irresistible allure of loot crates.",0

10913,"edit: one minor gripe. as you keep playing, even once you max out gauntlet and forge, the enemies keep getting harder. this normally would be an okay thing, but it eventually becomes impossible. while the game is very rewarding, it doesn't reward you enough to keep up with the increasing difficulty, and increasing legendary cards your ai opponents will play on you. eventually you're reduced to playing gauntlets and hoping for them to get crap hands the entire match, or else risk being reduced to getting wooden chests for your efforts. this really forces you into a wall. and even buying packs won't help, because they seldom ever give you any cards that boost your ability. a legendary drop from a card pack is an extremely rare thing. this makes it feel like you're reduced to waiting for seasons to reset, so you can start beating opponents for rewards again. been playing it on mobile more than steam. so my time is low on here. i highly recommend to mtg and hearthstone fans that are looking for something a bit more rewarding. this game really doesn't reach for your wallet at all. and it's very friendly towards people that just want to play solo against ai. it doesn't force you to play other people to earn currency/packs like hearthstone does. i do wish you could clear out the daily quests from the forced mutliplayer stuff, however. the mechanics are closer to mtg than hearthstone. but the attributes of cards (charge, deadly, etc) follow more closely to hearthstone than mtg.it has a good sized campaign, which mostly sits as your tutorial. there's a gauntlet mode, reminscent of hs's arena mode, though you'll pick your deck before hand. there's a forge mode that's exactly like arena from hs, picking between 3 cards up until your deck is finished, then battling a series of opponents. i've really only checked the solo side of things. i know mp has ranked and casual, and a draft. i've heard rumblings that some decks are unbalanced in mp (aggro decks that kill before you can even get your mana up). but i can't really speak on that. i guess i can see where you can make some insane op decks. but that's kind of the fun part. i've been doing the same, and ranking up in gauntlet. this game throws free packs, and currency at you like i've never seen in a ftp game before. it's very generous. you will get plenty of cards for your collection if you play regularly.edit: still really enjoying this game a few days later. which is unusual for me. i usually binge on a game, and then am done with it after a few days. this game is just so rewarding. i'm playing gauntlets, forges, and drafts, and the game just throws gold, crafting shards, and packs at you like crazy. the satisfaction of building a successful deck, and trying new strategies really keeps this game going for me. comparing decks on websites like eternalwarcry, and planning my next deck is a big plus too. again, i really have a high recommendation for this game.update - july 16,2018: one minor gripe. when the game absolutely wants you to lose, you're going to lose. you'll either draw no mana, or all mana and no minions/powers. or the opposing ai will topdeck a perfect game on you. it just happens sometimes. so be prepared for that. i really wish they'd adjust the ai/rng for that. it's painfully obvious when you're getting blocked from a win on a forge/gauntlet or otherwise ai match. you can tell when there's a fair exchange after playing a few weeks. and then you can tell when the game just absolutely doesn't want you to win.",1

10126,"i am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.*** gameplayi tried this game and liked it so much that i purchased a one-year membership after a few days. the relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. you basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. there are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. you will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. tracking gets easier the more you play. with the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. it also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. this game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time. *** membershipsall players start as guest and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. a membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. a permanent license is not available.*** hunting groundsthe reserves in the western part of this world resemble of american continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in europe. currently seven reserves are available. each has its own charm and of course its animal species. at the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. you can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. the maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.*** animalsat this point the game features 18 species. some of them can attack the player. many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. for many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. shooting animals in thehunter quite demanding. the animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.*** weaponsa host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. using the open sights can be just as much fun though. depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. there is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals. shooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.*** equipmentthere is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. there are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting. *** in-game moneyall game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. it can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires. *** missionscurrently there are a total of 245 missions available. most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. you will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.*** competitions & leaderboardscompetitions are run around the clock for all animals. players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. the top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. in addition em$ can be earned. all animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. the best players will make their way into the hall of fame. *** multiplayermultiplayer parties are client-based, there are no mp servers. in the game it is possible to chat with others. players can hunt as team or on their own. it is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.*** things i don't like- the website's style is not outdoor-like. also the font size and the line spacing are too large. there is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store.- the large antlers of the red deer are completely unrealistic. the red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being european.- some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. the most obvious ones are the brown bear and the roe deer.- it is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them. sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.*** conclusionthe game is constantly being enhanced with new content. it remains one of the best games i have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. it is unique with its lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. there is a great random factor and unpredictability, which i think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. i keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old.",1

9060,"i just reinstalled and retried planetside 2 for the first time since it came out, and i can say with unwavering certainty that its one of the very worst new player experiences ive ever had with a game. it was mesmerizingly terrible at giving a positive first impression.- despite having just installed what one should reasonably assume was the latest version via steam, the game still required a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup, as well as a third party registration, without the ability to sync with my steam account.- the tutorial is stretched over a needlessly expansive area, and the narrators lines frequently bleed into and play over one another if one moves along ahead of the plodding pace it wants one to. needless to say, this renders any help such lines could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless, leaving one to flail about and learn through trial and error, rather than instruction, instead.- the very first thing i experienced upon connecting to an instant action is getting spawn killed with an airstrike not one second after setting foot on the ground. fan-ing-tastic.- the ui is one of the very worst ive ever encountered in terms of giving mechanical information to new players. i know it shows information on controlled areas, flashpoints, how many friendlies and hostiles are detected in an area, etc, and thats all nice; however, there are some much more practical questions it seems intent on not answering. where can i spawn? how can i change respawn locations? why, when i attempt to decipher the help menu tooltips for the map, and find that i must use warp facilities to change spawn regions, am i greeted with an insta-death restricted area message upon attempting to reach one of those facilities? who knows! im just constantly told to click the instant action tab, and let the game carry me off to wherever it thinks im needed, regardless of whether i want that region or not. - when i attempted to ask other players in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill, i was greeted with the following automated message: the dead cant speak. i actually uttered an are you ing kidding me? aloud in my office at this point.i know planetside 2 is a well-respected game, and im sure, once one is familiar with it, that theres some reason for that. this isnt about that. this isnt a comprehensive review, nor is it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game. this is simply a commentary regarding the initial impression its current version gives to new, uninitiated players. the short version is this: i felt unwelcome, not by the players, not by my squad, not by my faction, but by the game itself, as a newcomer to planetside 2. at every turn, it seemed as though i was getting punished for not knowing things that a proper tutorial should have taught me, for not realizing the answers to questions i didnt realize i even needed to ask. it felt as if it were deliberately obfuscating critical information that it just expected me to know without proper instruction. ill make this as clear as i can: my initial impressions of planetside 2 were so negative that ive no desire to learn the lessons necessary to further understand the game. im sure the answers are there. im just left with such a poor impression of my experience that ive no inclination to pursue them. im leaving the game - again - and this time, im not returning.",0

6815,"this game just can't get my recommendation. i'd leave it at neutral if i could. the game itself is fun. you got vehicles and explosions all about. i enjoy that it does retain some sense of realism to it. here's why i'm neutral on it: the best teams to join in when you start off the game is american. if you start off as soviet union or germany though, you will probably not see victories unless the opposing team has way less members than you, or until you reach the point of seeing automatic weapons on your team being used. when you join a match, you'll begin to realize that the americans have fully automatic weapons and even vehicles with mgs on them. as for the soviets? well, we start off with semi automatic rifles and jeeps/trucks that serve no purpose other than transport. why is this a problem? a lot of the starting battles take place at close range so the full auto guns have complete advantage over the soviet union. the armed vehicles actually suppress and deteriorate any advance made by soviet union. you could say get skill but really, it wouldn't matter. you can be extremely skilled and yet, be so limited due to the crappy soviet loadout. it seems you would actually need to pay to win as the soviets. so unless i begin to see the starter battles look less biased towards americans, my opinion won't change.",0

11797,"wow. where do i even start? neowiz has had more than ample time to address some of the concerns with this game that have been plaguing it for years... this was by far the absolute worst launch i have ever experienced and i own archeage, diablo 3 and many others that go down in the history books for such. the combat is an absolute joke. this semi-linear, tab targeting combat system makes you feel like you have somewhat of a variety but in reality you'll just be spamming the same 2 buttons constantly. when i say spamming, i mean you'll hit r 7 times and then it will finally use your chain skill. there is an undeniable lag from the input to actual action that makes you feel like you're on dial-up. the ui is possibly one of the worst aspects of this entire game. there are literally games from the late 90s with better and more customizable uis (asheron's call, the realm online, etc...). completely ignoring the fact it takes approximately 907 tries to get the game to actually launch, once you're in you're plagued with constant crashes, graphics lag and other terrible graphics issues such as the game freezing for a few seconds just from opening your quests journal, inventory or map. as if it wasn't terrible enough at this point, the game won't even support it's advertised aspect ratios/resolutions. if you choose the wrong settings on the launcher it will crash your game when you launch it. the pure amount of technical issues with this game, the absolutey poor response and acknowledgement of these issues on neowiz's behalf and the fact that there are apparently no plans to address any of these issues is why i cannot recommend this game and i am requesting a refund.literally 1/5 stars.",0

9742,"i've read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguning because they look similar. because both characters have red headed swordsman, female elf archers, and purplehaired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other. but where the difference ends. story: the story is that a stone called the el were stolen by bandits and its up to the el search party to get it back. the story moves on to each village to move the story. the el stone story ends at altera when you finish the quest tunring everything back to normal. then story goes to feita with an demon invasion. the story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or naruto. 9.75/10characters: there are currently 9 characters on both versions. what suprises me about them are that 3/9 characters included demons. chung, ara haan, and elesis. the character are elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, cung, ara haan, elesis, and the insane add. i like add the most because of his backstory, gameplay, and personality (reminds me of lasercorm from smosh games). i feel mad for raven, chung, ara, and add. raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers, his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who u can fight in the first dungeon in altera. chung's dad got possesed and almost died from severe injuries. ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon (final boss of hamel) and add family got killed (not by demons), sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation. the backstories suprises me with any way. (thank u south korea) 9.80/10gameplay: by comboing your enimies to oblivion through special/actives skills. when u reach level 15 you'll be able to choose multiple paths. 3 for elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, and chung. 2 for ara and elesis and currently 1 for add at the time. you will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend 200 k-ching and you'll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the 2nd job at level 35. either quest line or pay 400 k-ching you're pick. what i really love about elsword is he final dungeons. the final dungeons supply you exp for you to level up and a challengin boss. there's a dungeon called henir's time and space which actually a boss rush mode. i've seen videos of player beating it with they're best time. there are also secret dungeons when u get to the level cap (70). however there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields. when all of the stamina runs you can't dungeon untill 3:30 a.m. 9.5/10pvp: the match making... is absolutley broken. my level 42 elsword is set with a max level elesis. you start playing pvp at level 10 its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later. 0.01/10community: the only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms. 7.89/10cash shop: i can't get enough with the cash shop. costumes. check. quick slot extensions. check. pet adn mounts. check. inventory expansion. check! 10/10final verdict: i love this gams with a passion. i have over 500 hours in to this game and my highest level is a add. combo monsters to oblivion. the gamplay is good. pvp is below average. the stamina can get annoying but who cares. 9.99/10",1

3821,"the premier online hat simulator, 2007 edition. if you are reading this and have never played this game, please don't start now. tf2 is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top. it has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics. it has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade. it has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)tf2 is as much a social platform as it is a video game. it's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics. there's also an fps minigame which i hear is occasionally populated. unfortunately, with the meet your match update in the summer of 2016, valve removed the quickplay function from tf2, killing off all community servers not named skial. now the landscape consists of 24/7 2fort, harvest, hightower and turbine. it's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.with mym valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers. the casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be. it's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory 60 second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game. player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason. tf2 still has huge balance issues. sniper, a poor fit for the game in 2007, is insanely un-fun to fight against 11 years later. there are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. the class needs a fundamental rework to remove the insta-kill all classes from any range mechanic. scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels. since 2016, medic runs at scout speed with any medi-gun, making scout completely dominant in 6s competitive. heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion. core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all. since 2014, heavy's minigun starts at 50% of its base damage. spy is both up and op at the same time. baguette now runs at medic speed, and faster than scout when he pops the dead ringer. valve nerfed the ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, valve overdid it by a factor of 2). they have left the diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.as of this writing, the big 3 tf2 cheats (the l word, the n word, and the c word) are all undetected. hackers are rampant in valve's competitive and casual modes, and there's plenty on the few populated community servers as well. the hasn't been a major vac ban wave in tf2 for all of 2018.all of this would be problematic but possibly understandable if valve were a small company keeping their game alive. the company is worth nearly 20 billion dollars at this point. half of that is in gaben's back pocket. there's like 5 dudes who work on tf2 (valve has claimed up to 16 at one point) and while i am sure they are working hard, they're very understaffed.valve's flat structure was a dumb idea 20 years ago, but the company did manage to produce many gems for their first decade. for the last 10 years, the company has grown hugely and made so much money they don't even know what it means to give a . the company's internal structure actively works to the detriment of the customers.if you're still reading and you've actually played this game, you know what i'm talking about. i'll see you on doublecross later this evening.",1

16809,"the overall gameplay is enyjoyable and the quirky cooking theme is unique. despite my former statement this game is very unfair and dull for the majority of the game, allow me to explain. (to preface this is only from my experience if you want to play give it a try) i understand the fact that battle royales have rng. luck plays a roll in your success, in cuisine royales case though i feel like it's too random. 7 out of 10 games i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope. other games i will spawn in a decent location, and i'll end up looting 6 houses and leaving the area with a c96 pistol with 8 bullets and a pot on my head. the game's dull for the most part due to the fact that for 90% of the ing game you don't engage with anyone and don't even get me started on the gun play. the accuracy of weapons in this game are atrocious largley due to bullet bloom. i do not understand why some developers add bloom as a game mechanic, but it's ; it destroys the majority of skill that goes into aiming your weapons, and it makes fire fights for the majority of the time down to luck. due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapons with the exeptions of the mg 42, and the ppsh and a few others which leads to tough late games when you are lucky enough to have regular engagements in the game. in my opinion it rewards hiding instead of engaging. the weapon damage seems inconsistant as well. some times i will put 15 bullets into someone and they won't drop and i'll end up losing the engagment 0ther times i'll completely rip open the guy in like 3 bullets. i realize that there are most likely hit multipliers, but nobody should need to be hit 15 consecutive times to die. it's glitchy as well i was playing duos with a friends and we were going to win the game, but instead the game decided to clip him into the military fort that he was standing on when he went prone ontop of it ultimitely trapping him and killing him. this game has a lot of potential. i know it's in early access; i will keep playing, and i will re-review this game if the developers fix issues and are proactive in the community looking forward. the accessory mechanic was a very good addition and makes the game unique compared to other battle royales. darkflow studios even though this was an april fools joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular. optimistic for the future.(i still recommended this game since it is fun but it's broken in a lot of aspects. i wanted to address them while giving my take on this game and thoughts for the future).",1
4185,"i thoroughly enjoyed this game when first installed, mostly due to nostalgia and my enjoyment of tcgs. that being said, many, many cards from the series are not included. no pot of greed, no monster reborn, etc. the ai is highly unbalanced. initially, the computer opponents practically hand you victory after victory. eventually, the ai will reach such a level that only very specific decks will allow you the chance to win. the game will repeatedly mention there is no such thing as a correct deck, however, in this game, that is definitely not true. i got to a point where i won maybe 1 out of 5 games, and if you want anything for the loss, you have to stick it out through the extra five minutes of the ai making pointless moves to flaunt its power while you sit there just waiting to die so you can go on to the next losing match. you can always play against easy opponents at any time, however, you have to earn keys, since they cost keys to play. great time waster for a week or so, but then this game becomes very tedious. i will also mention that in the 124 hours logged into this game, i earned enough gems to open just shy of 300 card packs. i mention this merely so you can have an idea of how many cards i had, and so that you know i had many choices in strategy before i just decided to call it quits and uninstall.",0

13625,"it's a great game but once you get everything ... unless you are very creative to do stuff on your own or you have a community of people to build with ... this game becomes very boring. and it pains me to say this, even if i bought every single dlc and recipe pack in the game ... looking forward for the next big thing that creativerse has to offer so that i can come back to it and get hooked one more time. i want adventures in my own world, i want that rare items become even rarer, i want to work hard in order to have everything i want rather than to just keep chests full of every item. but i still love the game.",1
12866,"i actually like this game. but i cant seem to stop thinkin that maybe the progression takes more time for the microtransactions to make sence. and thats a shame, since the game is fun and makes you loose time without even notice. still could be better",0
19081,it really depends on what you both prefer. i'd ideally take a game with big areas to explore and play around in like minecraft or an mmo so that you can spend time walking around together so that the game becomes the backdrop to you both spending time together. if a game is too intense or requires too much focus you won't be able to give each other the attention that makes it a date and not just playing video games. so besides minecraft i'd say maybe stardew valley or journey. portal 2 can also be fun since communication and problem solving are the two key aspects of the game's online cooperative mode.,1

3599,"team fortress 2 is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. in the 3000+ hours i've spent with this game running, i've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who i respect and value dearly, made $20,000 at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. it's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in college were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now. i was once a free-to-player. i played it for a good 9 months before deciding to finally try being a premium. that's how it got me. i first bought a unique 'huntsman' from the in-game store. then i found a phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, i tried selling it for $20 on tf2outpost. those were simpler times. from there i ended up investing $1000 (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. i could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but i really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. this is a very fun, very addictive game.it is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. at any given time, there's anywhere from 50,000-70,000 players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game i've played. you will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. you'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.in light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell valve what they want and actually see a response. it's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. for many people, such as myself, i'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and i'll always be thankful for the time i've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences i would not have been able to otherwise.for the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, i give team fortress 2 a very warm recommendation. just know when to put it down, remember, 3000 hours is close to 5 months playing 24/7.",1

2897,"it's an enjoyable experience as long as you don't take the game seriously, as it is then when its major flaws come into surface.they claim they seek historical accuracy, yet there's still vehicles (as st-a1) with the incorrect model and performance.well you'd expect them to fix it right? nearly a whole year has passed and no mention has been made regarding this problem by the company.by no means do the issues end with this particular vehicle, they extend to battle ratings of the vehicles (something as levels when it comes to which vehicles you face), wrong shells, wrong payload when it comes to bombers, wrong armor values, etc. and the best of it? well, the answer to this problems is simply add new content to try to attract a newer player base into the game, and simply ignore the most experienced and veteran player base, who fed up with the issues, will end up leaving.to be clarified: i do not have 23.1 hours into this game, i simply reinstalled the game not long ago and gave it another try, i have been around since 2013.i still play the game, but only in custom battles, as i have been fed up with the other aspects of the game. hope this came in handy.",0

14556,"if we were back in time around 2014-2015, i would recommend this game. now, it deserves to be un-recommended. as you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. i only started playing around mid-2014 and personally, i thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. i got the majority of my 116 hours of playtime in the first year since i got it. now, the game has just gone downhill. freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the random loot crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. before, you couldn't win a battle arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. now, there can be one or two enormous mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. their recent update with the random loot crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. also, what they call the best player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best k:d ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. this increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates. from the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a premium account for the game. in conclusion: robocraft was awesome. because freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not premium. now, robocraft is horrible. because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. this game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.---update: after months on end of ignoring the game, i forced myself to boot it up one more time just so i can see what's new and how the community has changed. now i would like to declare that robocraft has officially died. it's just not what it was before. everything is different, in a bad way. this is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money. rip robocraft!!---",0

5154,"brawlhalla is a very fun game that is very similar to super smash bros. to me this is the only game that you would find enjoyable then any other brawller out thier. and also its f2p! and its very fun. also the game has alot of competition. this game may already be considered in the esports industry, as it has ranked, all characters are prefectly balanced, and requires a great amount of skill if someone wanted to be a pro in this game as thier is many playstyles and strategy. also this game has community tournaments on esl and have cash prize ones on reddit that gives out a fair amount of money if won.prize pools are around 200 - 1500$ however this increases as the game progresses. and basically since its open beta this game is going to get very big one day with an ever expanding amount of characters to actually choose from. what would make this game different from smash bros is how this game will constantly come out with characters and weopons for you to choose from. also this game alllows you to buy skins for your characters to make them look good!. also the community is really friendly and willing to help other players get better at the game. out of all games i played to mobas, rts, and mmo and i still find this game less of a pain and its very enjoyable to play. espicially with custom lobbys to play with friends on. also the developers stream on twitch and many expirienced players do also. also thier are crews that are really cool if you get into the competitive side. i feel as if this game willl become a noticible esport in the future.thanks bmg for making such a great game! 10/10",1

13437,"i recommend this game insofar as the price is right - free. the visuals are pretty darn good for a voxel, minecraft type world. in terms of gameplay this starts off rather fun and interesting. a lot of biomes to explore and find. building is intuitive for the most part. the block rotation took a while to figure out and the method of spinning the blocks around is actually maddening. if they had made it so holding down r locks your hud and only spun the block instead of your character as well, this would've been a lot easier. beyond that, the game sorta falls flat after a few weeks because of limited building capabilities. one you get to the lowest levels of the map (corruption) and farm up a bunch of those materials and collect all the animals and things you want, there isn't much else to do but build. and that can be gratifying for a while. i enjoyed building little farms, collecting a bunch of animals and plant from different biomes, making a refillable refridgerator and lava producer, mob spawners and what not. bult some cool buildings and a boat and a bunch of other stuff, but after a while you hit a wall. the types of blocks are not even filled out - for example you can make chairs and tables with wood - stone - obsidian - iron - diamond - lumite - the full material progression. but then something like barred windows only goes up to stone... sorta weird. other things are like being able to make lumite walls but no stairs, roofs, or floors. so, making high end buildings that are unified in theme is basically impossible at this point. in addition, while this does have animal taming, block rotating, and a few other mechanics mine craft doesn't, it is dwarfed by minecraft's other content - there are no ai peeps, there is nothing like switches or rail tracks, etc. to give this game a lot of high end, end-game content to keep you building for years like the minecraft folks have. there are no end-game boss mods other than this one rockzilla thing you can spawn in. and unlike in other games, your tamed mobs become basically farm animals. nothing fights for you. no mounts. they kinda just sit around.anyway, fun to take for a spin, particularly if you never got into minecraft and this is your first foray into something like this. if it weren't free, i woulda probably said it was a waste of time and money.",1

7374,"tl;dr - it's hearthstone, but with all personality removed.tes: legends falls into the same trap so many other ccgs have - it's not a game anyone actually wanted to make, so they just took some mechanics from existing games, slapped some differnt pictures on the cards and called it a day. mechanically, it's perfectly functional; the interface is clean and works nicely, while games flow pretty quickly and will usually take no more than 5-10 minutes. the single-player campaign serves as a tutorial that introcudes the mechanics for those who haven't played similar games, but if you've seem almost any ccg before you'll quickly get bored as you're forced to play an hour or so of easy games just to unlock the rest of the game.as for the mechanics themselves, it really is almost all just a copy and paste of hearthstone. you gain mana each turn with no need for lands or similar, you play mainly creatures which can choose to attack either each other or the hero, you also get spells which are the usual damage, debuffs, and so on, and you have extremely minimal interaction during your opponents turn. pretty much all creature abilities are taken directly from hearthstone (charge, deathrattle, etc.), with the exception of trample taken from mtg (mtg itself has far more abilities, so it's clear which game was being copied here). you even start with 30 health and have decks with a default of 30 cards.there are precisely two things in the game that aren't identical to hearthstone. firstly, the board is (usually, although not always in single player) split into two lanes, with creatures in a lane only able to attack other creatures in that lane. in single player sometimes the lanes will offer different effects, but in most games it's simply one normal and one that gies creatures stealth for a turn. in theory this is supposed to open up more tactical choices, but in practice it really just brings the game more similar to mtg by opening up a bit more freedom in attack and defence. it at least makes things a little different from hearthstone, but it still doesn't bring anything actually new to the table. the second part, which might actually be original, is that each time you take 5 damage (relative to your starting health, so healing will delay it), you draw a card. this makes rush decks slightly less powerful and opens a bit more possibility for comebacks - a player who falls behind early can end up with a 5 card advantage which is quite a lot in games like this - but it doesn't really change the game in any significant manner. related to this is the equivalent of hearthstone secrets which give the sole interactivity during an opponent's turn. when drawing a card due to damage, if it has the prophecy ability you can play it immediately at no cost. unlike hearthstone and mtg, neither you nor your opponent have any idea if or when this will happen, so while this can be quite powerful, it's extremely unpredictable and impossible to plan around. it's at least the one thing not ripped directly from another game, but it's really not an improvement.there are no heroes as in hearthstone, but rather classes that combine two card colours. each colour focusses on certain things, such as big creatures for red or spells for blue, but other than restricting which cards you can put in a deck that's the only effect classes have. if this sounds similar to mtg, that's because once again it's essentially identical, other than restricting you more than mtg does in exactly the same way that many recent ccgs have done. the influence of hearthstone can really be seen with some of the colours, such as yellow focussing on summoning lots of small creatures and then buffing them, to the point it couldn't have been any more obvious what they were copying if they'd actually name the tokens silver hand recruit.as for the game types and free-to-play model, again, see hearthstone. you have single player tutorial/practice mode, adventures (one available so far), online ranked matches and arena. packs and arena even cost exactly the same as in hearthstone, and you can disenchant and craft cards in exactly the same way. as a new game, it's not really possible to comment on how fair progression is; there are nowhere near as many cards available as older games so the ability to get a decent number of cards early on doesn't mean much. this question can only be answered over the next few months and years as it becomes clear if (and how much) money is needed to have a decent chance of competing, or at least having fun as a new player.finally, where the game really falls down is its utter lack of character. the strength of the tes games has always been in the writing and the interaction of the player with the world. the world itself is just a rather generic fantasy setting with your standard elves and cat people and so on, and since each game has been set in a different time and covered different events, there aren't really any established characters, places, famous weapons, and so on. this means that unlike hearthstone, where many cards are recognisable and themed arpound their lore, and legendaries are well known bosses and important characters, cards in tes:l range from generic elf to the legendary slightly different generic elf. the lack of animations (plenty of particle effects but no actual movement) just makes it worse - instead of dropping ragnaros with a big thump and burst of fire, you just place a card with a picture of an elf on it. if you care about tes lore, this game won't offer you anything recognisable or anything new. if you don't already care about tes lore, this game is certainly not going to get you interested in it. it's a functional, generic fantasy ccg with mechanics copied directly from other ccgs, mainly hearthstone with a bit of mtg, and a total lack of any character or anything of interest to recommend it over the many other similar games currently on offer. it doesn't offer new and interesting gameplay, it doesn't offer interesting characters or gripping story, it doesn't connect in any way to previous tes games, it just exists for the sake of having a ccg with the tes name attached to it.",0

16214,"free gun porn!!!world of guns: gun disassembly (wog) is essentially a catalogue of exploded diagrams for various firearms, except instead of two-dimensional isometric drawings, the component parts have been meticulously modelled in three dimensions. whats more, the component models can be manipulated, both individually and as assemblies. the camera controls (e.g. pan, tilt, zoom, track, etc.) allow fly-throughs of the models from any perspective, even those that would prove impractical in reality. there are also cutaway views and several levels of x-ray views, in addition to the lovingly rendered photorealistic finishes. whats more, the actions of each model have been animated, and the animations can be run at normal speed or a number of slow-motion speeds, with any of the views! this allows study of the ingenious mechanisms (e.g. springs, levers, cams, index wheels, gas porting, etc.) at a level simply unavailable anywhere outside the digital realm.the game aspect of wog involves dismantling and reassembling the guns, with challenges based on speed and accuracy. there is also a shooting range, although only a few of the guns can be used for target shooting.some of the models allow alternative parts to be fitted, such as different size magazines and custom grips, and some allow you to mount accessories such as suppressors and scopes. there is also a paint mode, where budding graphic designers and modellers can create custom skins for the models.the firearms catalogue is quite extensive and growing all the time, with community voting used to decide which models should be developed next. the majority of the catalogue is not initially available, being unlocked with experience points earned by performing tasks with the unlocked models. it is possible to purchase the entire library, but i would not recommend doing so immediately, as the higher complexity models will be very daunting before developing some familiarity with the system. it appears that there are also other, non-firearm models available for purchase, such as automobiles and animal skeletons, but i have not explored this. there is also a significant body of community-created content available via the steam workshop.i recommend that anybody with even a remote interest in firearms or mechanical engineering download and try wog. the price is impossible to argue with, and there is a chance that it will prove fascinating.",1

28202,the map is generated on your first click and you always click an empty square (i.e. no mines in the 8 squares surrounding it). when you click an empty square it also reveals any adjoining squares that are empty until you reach a kind of border where all the squares have numbers in. that gives you multiple sources of information to use to deduce the location of the mines.,0

7130,"7/30/2017 - 19.2 hrs last two weeks / 19.2 hrs on recordi found this while meandering around steam looking for new/different stuff to play.i've played hearthstone and magic: the gathering. i quit both because i did not get enough fun proportionate to the cost.this game shares the resource pool mechanics with hearthstone and the artistic beauty of magic: the gathering. it doesn't look as expensive as either of them. given the game is in its infancy, it makes sense that there are no special formats based on the release date or release set of the cards. the rune mechanic strongly influences the metagame and sets the elder scrolls: legends apart from its spiritual parent, hearthstone.deck building is based on a maximum of two of the five attributes plus a neutral pool, which might as well be called colors by mtg standards or classes by hs standards. i see this aspect as a direct upgrade from hs's system, even though (and perhaps especially because) tesl offers no class abilities. this also removes the pigeon-hole effect from class-only cards by essentially allowing you to dual-class. i think class abilities make the game less about the cards themselves. in a card game, i hope the game retains an undiluted focus on the cards.the intro story mode was riveting with its special game modes and meaning-lite choices, and helpful as a tutorial. i look forward to the opportunity to explore the current dark brotherhood segments and future story chapters, with the in-game currency.it's a card game. no matter how competitive or wise you may be, there are randomized elements that are both the intrigue and ultimately the achilles' heel of the game. luck may have it that you win some and you lose some, or that you win many and you lose few, or that you win few and you lose many. winning feels good (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when i could be faced with opponents of wildly varying skill levels and deck strengths. losing feels bad (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when both players in a match are subject to draw both useful-at-the-time and not-so-useful-right-now cards. winning or losing too easily feels unearned, and while the rune mechanic alleviates some of that problem, it also introduces some right back.i will hold onto my wallet for now. i've taken a look at some of the starter and one-time-purchase (?) packs available, and i could easily see myself spending $30. i've spent much, much more than that on magic, but i'm not here to spend money; i'm here to entertain and validate myself in a competitive environment. i believe many of us are.whether or not you've played other card games, i recommend giving this one a try. just remember that it's a card game, and like real life, there are aspects of it that are out of your direct control. never feel too good, or too bad, about the outcome of a match; just play the game, and if you aren't entertained, find something else to do. i write this for myself.~~~follow up update 7/31/2017~~~it's incredibly easy to burn out on this game. might as well just show up for the daily quests and then leave, since the rest is heavily based on luck for a newer player without enough full sets of cards to make a more reliable deck.it was quite fun for the first day or two. it really was. now there's nothing left but a bucket with a dollar sign on it. it really isn't worth my time to grind for gold/exp/gems, because it will never be enough and it will always take too long.my next review will be in one year after i've accumulated the 365 * 40 gold that should yield. maybe then there will be a game for me to play. yes, it's a free to play game. i don't much like disappointment, though, no matter how much it cost.i can't recommend the game in its current form.",0
9195,"this game is pretty fun. i've been to it on and off for a while now. the only problem i have with this game is that sometimes you can't find a good squad/platoon. if you can find a good outfit who on the daily runs missions, and communicates with each other, you'll have a really good time. also, you don't seem to get many credits so if you want a gun without paying real money, you'll have to wait a long time and save those credits.7.8/10",1

10575,"my original review from jan'17, probably launch of the ea was negative. i gave it another try at steam release, and it is a very pleasant surprize. the devs were not sitting on their hands, but created way more mechanics, so the old boredome is left in the past. also there are different play modes. and a ton of puzzles. the latter alone would be enough for a thumbs up.i have no intention to use the money shop,and not really interested in the competitive part where i doubt p2w is avoidable in this model. at start the game seems to drop plenty of cards at you, so i guess it will take some time till i get bored with the guantlet and forge. also have to mention that the gfx is top notch and the interface as good as you can ask for. i hope it won't get ruined by greed, like plenty other games with similar business model.",1

16367,"picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting, especially being free. i was wrong.the developers put a lot of work into this game. the models in-game are based on real world models. every part is labeled with it's correct name, down to the smallest pins, rollers and springs. if you are detail oriented, mechanically-minded, or simply curious, this will be up your alley!whether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function, check this game out. i don't even consider this to be a game, but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side. there are pay aspects, but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns, such as military vehicles, race cars, even skeletons, etc. as for progression within the gun world, it's free.the game consists of assembly, dis assembly, function, games (including a firing range) and even painting the firearms. you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can, without hasty clicks, and without errors for extra points. it's very challenging (and i'm adept at this using actual firearms). the x-ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm, even while firing, reloading, safety on-off, etc. this is what i liked the most about it.in the real world, one can take apart an actual gun, learn the names of the parts, and understand the basic functions; but to see the pieces in action (while inside the gun) gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together.the models are pretty good looking too. they aren't super high res, but they aren't low-res either.my only two complaints with this game:- the way one moves around the gun/parts to get a different angle is awkward, sometimes frustrating, but it's not game-breaking bad...not by any means; just an annoyance at times.- some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be. for example: the ak-47, one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle-butt before removing the rifle-butt (in real life). the game penalizes the player if the pouch isn't removed first though. this problem is more of a developer's attitude of you have to follow my procedure, even if it's not necessary in the real world. this is not game-breaking either, but very frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors.overall, i would recommend this game, 100%.9/10",1
10836,"eternal is an excellent, f2p-friendly digitial card game with engaging gameplay, deeply flexible deck-building mechanics, and a diversity of game modes (pve and pvp versions of both draft and constructed play). i can't recommend it enough if your a fan of ccgs, and doubly so if you're looking for a more strategic alternative to games like hearthstone.my background: i played hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale metas. i moved onto duelyst and found i enjoyed the more complex, board-based gameplay, but recent expansions have promoted flashy, swingy games with increasing amounts of rng. i also tried other popular alternative ccgs such as shadowverse and elder scrolls: legends. neither hooked me.eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes. feel like grinding? gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the ai for decent, continuous rewards. ladder shows greater diversity than games like hearthstone, owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations. draft is excellent, featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards. it's an awesome way to build your collection, as you get to keep the cards you draft. this allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection, especially as you're starting out.while the diversity of game modes is what drew me in, the rich gameplay is what has really hooked me. mechanics such as echo (when an echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand), relic weapons (hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically), defender-prescribed blocking, and fast spells (spells that can be played in response to an opponent's actions including on their turn) make for some deep, strategic, and interactive gameplay that is much more rewarding than the back-and-forth nature of hearthstone. the card-based power mechanics (reminiscent of magic's lands) makes deck building very flexible and multi-faceted. three-faction decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck. at the same time mono-faction decks are quite valiable, with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported. deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire.eternal's meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers (who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than hearthstone's team 5), but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned ccgs i've played.the game is intensely f2p friendly. in addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes, each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards (the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises). packs provide twelve cards: 8 common, 3 uncommon (equivalent to a rare in hearthstone or duelyst), and 1 rare (epic) or legendary. gold-level chests award packs, and draft and forge (draft versus the ai) also award chests at a run's completion. all this is to say, regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection. i've enjoyed eternal tremendously for its rich gameplay. it's hard to believe the game is still in beta. future features like in-client tournament modes and best out of 3 play will only further round out this already stellar game. if you're a fan of card games, especially deeper ones, i can't recommend eternal strongly enough.",1

2802,"i have played this game for five years, and i must say to never ever download this game. ever since more premium vehicles have been added gaijin seems to only care about money. not only is the community of this game actually garbage, but they seem to only focus on certain tech trees and pertain to buffing them at all costs. recently in update 1.79 gaijin seemed to have added more prmium vehicles and interesting armor features. the intelligent members of the community saw this as a money grab and a distraction for the lemmings in the community. rather than fix in game issues gaijin added a shiny new vehicle and some cool features deriving from the much needed balencing issues and the other numerous issues this game is plagued with. basically putting a nice finish on a pile of four years ago i chose the soviet union for ground realistic battles. i had been grinding on the tech tree up until today 6/13/18 when i discovered something horrid. the object 906 had been moved to 8.0. incase who ever is reading this does not know, the object 906 is a modification to the pt-76 made by the soviet union in 1963 in order to modernize it. in game it has an armor piercing capped balistic capped shell that has decent if not good performance and a good high explosive anti tank shell. the only issue is the battle rating. at the battle rating of 8.0 the 906 goes against vehicles such as the leopard 1, the leopard a1a1 (with apds), the cheiftan mk3, the stb 1, and the american tanks which are of no issue. with all of these excellente vehicles combined it equals a bad time for the 906 which can barely pen all of these vehicles and has a 12k repair cost in game currency and a heaty heat shell expense. the icing on all of this is the fact that the battle rating before (7.3) was perfect for the tank. not only was it the only playable tank at that battle rating but it fought tanks that were in the same class at the same time. the only issue was the fact that a down tier would cause a massive problem as it out classed everything at 6.7. 7.7 was if not the perfect battle rating had the leopard not had the ability to instantly kill the 906 with heat because of hull break (yet another issue this game has). i have spent four years of my life for a tank that is completly useless. avoid this game if you value your time and money.",0

14772,"i have decided to rewrite my review completely to go over all of the current problems in more detail.i can see the game slowly fixing the balance issues and improving but it`s still not enough to make the game as good as it was before.first of all the new weapons :proto seeker - nerfed garbageshotgun - no complaints, but it feels unnecessary and pointless because of all the powerful long range weapons. it can only be used in close range if you have an invisibility module.mini shotgun - the same, but even more useless.loml - aka where it all began, for those who don`t know its the original disbalanced weapon update that everyone was outraged by. the weapon itself is idiotic because it takes no more than 3 simple steps to use this weapon : 1. aim 2. wait 3. left click.aeroflak - probably the only weapon that isn`t bad, but it still ruins lifes of many flying bots.however the problem that ruined the game are not the weapons, but the epic loot update.before you could play cassualy (about 2-3 hours a day) and collect enough to buy a loml in 2 days now it takes more than a week of grinding.crates are supposed to be something that you can purchase not a main way of receiving cash.i don`t want my cash income to be randomized. some say that it`s good because you can get premium items without having to pay for gc, but i haven`t seen a single person who prefers cosmetics over gameplay. also why should i grind for something if it`s unrewarding, random and boring. the feeling of progress is gone and is replaced by grinding and crates.there are also major score problems, but maybe i don`t entirely understand how the new system works. before it was simple - who dealt most damage gets first place. now people who do almost nothing can get first place for no apparent reason.new interface is not that bad, but please add an edit bot button in the preview section.inventory forge cost is incredibly bad. for example you built a 100k bot and you expect to get something for it, you see that you have 10 purchases, but where is the cash ? it`s simple everybody uses inventory forge cost and you end up receiving absolutely nothing. just make so that if somebody inventory forges your bot you receive at least a 1/4 of the bots price, you receive only a half of a full purchase anyway.also 500 cpu bot battles are just lomls a aeroflaks being pedofiles.i nearly forgot about new modules :invisibility - i don`t even know what to say about this one, it`s only used by shotguns and flying bots.shield - aka the least used item in the game, easy fix would be to make the shied move with bot.booster - aka how to make 1200 cpu bots better than 1500 cpu bots that don't have a module.",0

2762,"to start, i should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. when the community is good, it's great! i've formed many lasting friendships, and i'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i met through the game.but war thunder has a problem with women. not all players are like that--not even the majority. but enough s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls i know, and we as a community can do better.i'm a woman. i like to play comp, and i get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. for the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy j1 somehow gets me every push.) but there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if i'll send nudes, or if i'll perform an obscene act for you. (even if you're joking, it's really not funny, i promise.) it's grating to be continually asked if i'm a bomber main since i'm a girl, or for you to demand that i pocket you. (i don't play bomber. sorry. how about naval planes?)it's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them trolling me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and aand much, much worse. i've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. when playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.and despite all this, i still get on mic and speak. partly because i'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. time and time again, i've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. they say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. people say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.i know most of you are decent people. i'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. but we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. more than just reporting it when you see it (although i wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. even a simple hey man, that's not cool can both (1) let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and (2) let the harassee know that decent people do exist. the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.so please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!eta: thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, i appreciate it! it means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. like i said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.a couple people have said things akin to this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc. i'm well aware of how the internet can be, and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. it's not me i'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as i am who really suffer. just because i'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.people have also said things akin to if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating. aside from putting the blame on me (which i think is unfair), i don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. it's not like i announce to everyone hey guys, this is my girlfriend! we are dating! (although i really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). what generally happens is one of us will refer to other as babe during a game (e.g., nice pilot knockout, babe), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.also, every person who responded to this post with shut up bomber just proved my point. i know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit.",0
11873,"bless online looks incredible at first glance, but like a new car bought off craigs list the problems quickly come into view. the engine simply doesnt work, fps drops are consistent even on a pc that can run bdo on 60 fps consistently, the ui freezes your computer consistently for small spurts for no reason, the windshields literally 5 inches from your face and trying to adjust it simply launches it into the stratosphere, and finally the game itself freezes like its going to win something. now this can be forgiven as the game is in early access and as such can easily be fixed. lack of optimization is not neccessarily a bad thing and shouldnt affect ones purchase, however with this game having been released previously it doesnt really scream good things at you while you play.bless online has some of the easiest leveling in the game, which is one of the only things i am pleasantly surprised by. most games with enchanting systems like bless have long slogs of leveling and enchanting to keep people around for years (im looking at you bdo) simply because they lack content. bless seems to have corrected this issue. it is altogether possible to hit level 30 in around 10-14 hours while running dungeons and while it is boring it isnt neccessarily difficult. the problem with this is that the game is so boring you may never want to find out what combat or pvp is present at endgame and if you are lucky enough to not crash every 30 minutes you might even get that chance.tldr: bless offline is a brilliant tool to train patience with, if you enjoy staring at a login screen for hours and crashing constantly give it a try. also i enjoyed it 10/10 would play again...after its fixed... in 2 years",0

3693,"team fortress 2 (tf2) is one the games that you really have to try, it is free to play (f2p) and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter (fps) style. unlike most fps that is played competitively, it focuses more on fun and especially humor. tf2 has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats (yes you read it right, hats!).gameplaytf2 is fun yet a challenging game, it has a rich gameplay and a huge community. it is composed of two opposing factions represented by the name of these companies, the reliable excavation & demolition (red) and builders league united (blu) which are mercenaries hired by two opposing brothers. players can choose any classes, characters and the side they represent to compete against the opposing team through certain missions/objectives per game mode. gamemodes:unlike most fps games, tf2 has a lot of good game modes, every game mode has a different and unique play style which makes the game interesting. other game modes are still in beta stage thus small bugs might occur but overall it has a decent maps, objectives and team play. here's a list of game modes and its respective mission/objective:capture the flag - each team has their own intelligence briefcases that they have to protect from the opposing team, the main objective is to capture enemy's intelligence until they reach the game's capture limit.control point - game mode based on control points where you capture enemy points and protect each point from being captured.territorial control - game mode based on point to point where you must capture the enemy point and defend yours, points gets randomly selected in a different place to protect or to capture.payload - a series of checkpoints where you have to get the cart to the final point while the enemies tries to stop you.arena - a tactical mode whereas teams fight under pressure in a smaller maps for shorter matches. a control point is found at the center of the map, where you have to capture without being killed.king of the hill - like the arena, it focuses on a single control point where you have to capture till 3 minutes or defend the point before the enemy takes full control of the point. payload race - each team will be given a cart for teams to push and compete and defend the point against the other team.medieval mode - there will be a number of points like the control point but both teams can only choose from a set list of allowed weapons.special delivery - a unique game mode where both teams must capture a neutral briefcase, the team who takes it first must bring it to a specified area of the map while the opposing team must stop them defending the area. once the briefcase drops, enemy team can't take it but rather defend the briefcase from being taken.mann vs. machine - another unique game mode where a team of three or six player must defend the mann co's strongholds from a wave of raging robots that carries a bomb. robot destruction - a beta map where teams must destroy the opposing team's robots and collect the power cores to earn points. after gaining points, a reactor core appears that can be stolen by the opposing team.mannpower - teams must capture the enemy's intelligence briefcase while adding a twist in game with grappling hooks and 12 unique power-ups.pass time - another beta map that has a football like game play. team must take hold of the jack to throw it to the opposing team's goal.player destruction - a game mode created by the community where players must collect bottles of beer from killed enemies and jumping to the ufo after. once a player gets killed they will drop their held beers that can be taken by both teams.the best map for beginners would be king of the hill, its simple yet fun. classes and characters:most fps games focuses more on weapons and less on characters, in tf2 you can get to choose 9 different characters with unique roles and special abilities. the game is created to have fun thus expect a unique approach on certain abilities. here's a list of classes and characters with their respective roles and characteristics:offense (good for veterans)scout - a fast and agile character that can capture and pushes cart faster than any characters, has a special ability that can jump twice in mid air. equipped with scatter gun, pistol and a baseball bat.soldier - slower but durable character that uses a rocket launcher, shotgun and a shovel. he can use his rocket launcher to launch himself into the air (not into the outer space) with the cost of his health for a better aiming with style (seems ironic).pyro - a pyromaniac that uses flamethrower, fire axe and a shotgun, they can blast it to an ally to extinguish fire or use it to an enemy to gain distance.defense (good for advanced players)demoman - a character that uses explosives to defend an area. equipped with grenade, sticky bomb and a bottle.heavy - slow but can sustain and deal a huge amount of damage. equipped with an enormous mini-gun, a shotgun and its own fist to strike.engineer - a character that can build and destroy machines capable of defending with sentry gun, a teleport machine and a health and ammo dispenser. equipped with a shotgun, a pistol and a wrench. support (good for beginners) medic - a doctor that his main role is to heal his allies, healing allies can grant bercharge that can boost him and his healed ally. equipped with medi gun, syringe and a bonesaw.sniper - a sniper that can kill enemies with one shot from afar. equips with a sniper rifle (what would you expect, a laser beam?), a submachine gun and a kukri (a starter pack good for campers).spy - a character that sneaks into the enemy's back and strikes with a knife, has a special ability that can turn himself invisible to the enemies eyes and can destroy machines easily. equipped with a pistol, a watch that can make himself invisible, an elctronic sapper that can take down machines easily, a device hidden in a cigarette case that cloak himself into an enemy character, a revolver and a butterfly knife or balisong (originated from the philippines) that can kill with one stab if used properly. (absolutely not for newbies) classes, characters and team can be changed while the game is in progress. this can be done by pressing , (comma) to change class and character and by pressing . (period) to change team.controlsjust like most fps games, tf2 uses the standard keyboard set-up which is the basic wasd (forward, move left, backward and move right) movement, r to reload, q for last weapon used and etc. mouse is used to aim (point), shoot (left-click), use every character's special skill (right-click) and to change weapon (mouse wheel up or down). the controls are smooth and comfortable, weapons can be changed through the keyboard with keys: 1, 2 and 3/4, 5 and 6 or through the mouse button by scrolling up or down. prosartistic character designfree and easy to playup to 3 different classes and 9 different characters to choose fromhumorous and fun without pressuregood reward systemconsnew players might find this game challengingyou might get bored after some timeconclusionthe game is good to have fun and to kill some time but with more fps games coming around its hard to keep up. i recommend this game for non competitive ones and for those who just want to play a good f2p fps game, it has smooth and comfortable controls with decent character model and animation. overall, this game is unique and better than any other fps games, it has a strong game play and outstanding maps but if you are into a more competitive side, this game is simply not for you but absolutely worth the try.",1

14851,"my how far this game has fallen.i've been into this game since pretty damn near the beginning. back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. that sense of yeah, i built that when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.those days are long since past.the tiering system is gone entirely, and it is so easy to level up, that when i started the game after it was first changed. i jumped from 55 to 100 instantly, and i heard you could jump from even further back than that. the game's menus are so clunky now and they're hard to navigate... i still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. the colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. oh, no more tech points? there goes the fun in unlocking things too.the community robot factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. also, how much are these weapons?! ten million rp for a single top-power weapon? get stuffed i ain't payin' that i only get like 50-100k per battle!!!medic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. if you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. what a load of and the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.i really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. that was actually really fun and it was balanced too. guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.worst of all, the game crashes a lot more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, see ya no reward for you we just wanna waste your time bye! i swear the amount of times i heard a player has disconnected in one match was frightening, just before i crashed myself.i remember the days when i used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. complex, in the sense that all those cube variations; inner slope, edge slope, what? what are these for?at least they refunded all those new garage payments i made so now i have thousands upon thousands of free gc. so there's that at least.update time:so, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. fine, that's alright, it's a good start. what isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of rp whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. to quote, our intent was to help boost the rp income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable.so now what? now there is zero incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of rp just for participation. this just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game... if you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. if you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will earn that reward. but no, everyone gets similar amounts now. it's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day robin hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical wage-gap that no-one can prove exists. there's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so goddamn expensive. even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?well, at least they tried. they killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. i know some of you will call this nitpicking but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...update again:ok. they reverted the reward changes. i take back all that i said before. good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. let's see where the future takes the game now. they still have a bit to fix.",0

15739,"i played the opening section of the game and it was okay but i had a few problems1. the sprite work: the sprite work isn't necessarally bad, the problem is when artix went fron 2d to 3d the sprite work wasn't up to par with their other games the sprites weren't phenomonal in their 2d games either but the quality degrated when the game went into 3d. if artix patches the game and the sprites weren't so blocky then i would have no issue2. the controls: the controls in the game seemed rather awkward because rather than making the camera move with the mouse (it does but you need to click and hold as apposed to just moving the mouse one direction or another) they have the camera moving with the a and d keys so you can't strafe out of the way of an attack which isn't game breaking but it is rather bothersome when it comes to games of this nature. the controls would be better if the game stayed a point and click movement game (like aq worlds for example) or if they went with the mouse controling all of the camera and the wasd keys being just for movement.3. attacking/fighting: it isn't an issue but it would function better if the games attacks weren't set to the numbers, i get that it isn't easy designing a game and i may have higher expectations than others who play this game but it is a bit awkward using the arrow keys and the numbers at the same time and i do know that i could just use the number pad but that is awkward when i am using the mouse to change the angle and i get that the mouse isn't necessary at all but if you are going to say in the tutorial that i need to use the mouse but i really don't thats a little misleading when you first start a game. now i'm sure that this game has loads to offer but i just can't deal with the issue with the controls and fighting issue, the sprites are an issue of i know that artix can do better because they have done better i would love to see this game become huge and have millions of players but right now i can't be apart of that because of these issues.",0

9281,"this game is amazing. it's really my dream game. aircraft, tanks, and infantry all fighting side by side. there is no other game like this. the crazy part is you can play with out spending a penny. this game isn't pay to win. there are no weapons that are limited to members or people who spend tons of money. but don't get me wrong, planetside 2 is hard. when it was released, you were shot down into a pod and were in most cases killed instantly. they have added a ton of things to help out new players so if you picked it up in it's early days and left give it another go. make sure you join an outfit that suits you and always join a squad. people tell you where to go and you don't have to worry about it. it does have it's cons. i got bored around br 60 but took a break and got into it again. i have played a lot and it's pretty embarassing. since it has so many people and the servers are already handling so much it has client-side hit detection. meaning instead of the server processing that damage has been taken, what happens on your screen is what happened. content comes in kinda slow. the developers give us some gun that nobody uses instead of new abilities, vehicles, ect. you will encounter many bugs, however they are not game breaking most of the time (they tend to fix those). you need a nuclear power plant to run the game at 60fps on max settings in a huge fight.so if you're like me and spend 2 years on one game and then find a new one when you burn out, this is your game.",1

12383,"***edit-2015***if you had told me at the time i first wrote this review that things were just about to turn around and that this would become one of my favorite games of 2015 (and hopefully later) i would have had you committed.but that's exctly what happened. big shake ups went on at simbin and the company is now called sector 3. but more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.i have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. i will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.---old review below---it pains me not to reccomend this game. i own every single simbin game ever published and i still race in a gtr2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. every week, year around.naturally, gtr2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.we waited for gtr3 for a long time and we were very excited by simbin early previews of their new sound engine. it was truly something to behold.then gtr3 fizzled and raceroom racing experience came out as a free to play game. initially i was quite impressed. the sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. the graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the race07 series). the car handling was ok. nothing too advanced, but passable.even as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for gtr2.after the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an apex hunt game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. however, since it was a new game i even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of ai cars and multiplayer. while we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, r3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.then time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless liveries. the promised ai is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.the choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.frankly, if i could go back in time i would buy only the zacspeed ford and the additional hillclimb track. the free cars are ok, with the bmw hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. considering that the bmw and the hillclimb are free, i would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. all the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.there is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly. to me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. it could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what i ever paid for gtr2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. but no more. they released a dtm game that suffers from the same limitations (it has ai, but it is very weak) and for the first time since i ahve been simracing i did not buy it.maybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as gtr2 offered almost 10 years ago. maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised adaptive ai will really be what they promised. maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. maybe.when that happens, buy this game. until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.",1

5273,"a free, platform-based brawler reminiscent of the super smash bros series. there's a wide roster of characters with multiple movesets based on what weapon they're holding. all good and well, except everything in this game is made to be absolutely infuriating.- as smooth as the servers are, the way they correct themselves means hearing and seeing an attack connect without it actually connecting. you will get a lot of false positives in any multiplayer mode.- the casual ffa mode almost always ends up a huge cluster. your combos will be constantly be interrupted by other people, and it will not be fun.- when a high level ranked player enters the ffa for some reason, they will curbstomp everyone there guaranteed. because not even the casuals are allowed to have fun.- certain legends have been the subject of multiple complaints due to being drastically harder to deal with compared to other legends. nothing will actually be done about this because this is mostly a problem at lower levels of play, and everyone knows that if you aren't diamond, you don't matter.- the community is a cesspool of acid and salt. there is a button that will literally say 'gg' for you in the after-match chat, and players would still rather take the time to cuss you out than just press that button and leave.- ranked is filled with absolutely awful strategies to put up with such as constantly jumping up and down and being impossible to hit, running away, camping on the side of the stage, and only counter-attacking.- the matchmaking for ranked has always been awful, matching players up with others completely out of their league. in other words, the matchmaker focuses more on speed than fairness.- a lot of spanish players play on the english servers for...some...reason. they'll still rage at you in spanish.the game's biggest selling points are probably that this is a free platform brawler available on steam, and all of the legends are impressively balanced at high-level play. otherwise the game doesn't bring anything new to the table, even the flashiest specials aren't that impressive, and the soundtrack is hilariously underwhelming. long story short, if you only played fox in super smash bros melee and think only losers or noobs play for fun, you'll probably like this game.",0

8576,"so...i started playing this game about a week ago. absolutely loved it. it's important to note that i usually hate battle royale games. but not this game.this game took (emphasis on past tense), all the things i hated about the battle royale genre, and threw them out the window.it was colorfull, without being minecraft. it wasn't a camping simulator. and the rgn in this game was limited.you were encouraged, no, required to fight, if you wanted to have a good chance at winning. the best weapons and equipment didn't randomly drop somewhere, you had to craft them at a forge. crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player. this, and the fact that you got a reward (shards, which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general) whenver you killed another player, made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights. because fights were encouraged, and they were worth taking the risk.people couldn't just drop somewhere far off, loot everything and then camp.that is, until a few days ago. ignoring every bit of community feedback, the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out, and unique, and good, and threw it out the window.it's the same rng infested, camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now, that every other battle royale game already is too.you can find dozens of similar games now, with the only difference between them and this game being, that they are less colorfull, and their developers probably don't ignore the feedback from their community (unlike this game)",0

3639,"radically different from the going fps standard.a gem gameplay wise.it's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.that was the short version.if that didn't convince you yet, move along.the mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:while one class is able to perform a mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.the variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. and believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk does make a difference.talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being pay to win options - not in team fortress 2.owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. this makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.there's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.i guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-fps-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something i greatly appreciate, for that's what i personally feel titles like call of duty are lacking.there's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: minor annoyances.eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.so, to recap:whether you are casually or competitively motivated,whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.and yeah.the only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.9.5/10, would will play again.",1

1417,"updated 5th october 2017:be aware that you can also be suspended for no good reason because the devs don't want people to play the game other than in one single linear strategy. 1 week suspension received because having anything other than the devs strategy means you are accused of throwing a match.---original review below...this game has just gone from bad to worse.the match making is horrendous and alway has been since the introduction of team win / loose mmr opposed to personal skills / contribution being rewarded. the game just doesn't have enough experienced players for you not to have a team peppered with lower skills or lack understanding of the main objective. the problem with this is your mmr value is penalised due to mmr only being awarded for a match win (so regardless of how well you do personally). the devs solution to this is not to fix match making but to hide the mmr value from almost everywhere, with the last remaining mention of it earmarked for removal if/when ranked play is finally introduced.furthermore the matchmaking has been bust since players were able to group and raise their mmr by often queuing against solo players. there is no option as a solo player to opt out of being stomped by a team on a 3rd party voip that has a team coordination advantage. a solution to this was introduced to split groups during balancing if the team mmr disparity was above a certain threshold but this has subsequently been removed. the shrinking of maps dumbed down the strategy in the game and increased the death match style it currently has with very short respawn times based on level rather than personal death rate. other changes such as opening up a path to your base if you loose a gamma 3 fight further dumbed down the game as it made the match almost entirely about the outcome of gamma 3.there are so few players that the queue times for a match are insane, i'm talking around an hour or more waiting for a match in what is known as the bracket 4 player pool. this is the case even though over 2 thirds of the previous days highest concurrent player count are ingame.expect ai bots in pvp until you reach bracket 4 too.still no voip service available in game and the next most pressing feature to be added is the addition of a new in game store, eh yeah go figure the priorities...edit: you also aren't given the choice of what game mode you wish to play within pvp so if you don't like the frontline mode it's tough because you can be placed into either frontline or conquest. another bizare decision as both modes require the same number of players. it's like they deliberatly think of ways to cheese off the playerbase.since the current experience is beyond frustrating i can't recommend it with the problems it has.",0

4331,"ok first i've been 56h into this game. at first, i thought this game was great because i like yu-gi-oh and this game is beginner-friendly. the p2w elements are not very expensive (i've seen worse). today i played a pvp duel. i got my opponent into 400lp left. then he played a monster with an effect that makes him pay 1000lp at the end phase. so i was like yes! he's gonna suicide at the end of my turn, i won!. but i was playing my card and i noticed my time limit was at 3 secs! i hurried up to play my card but it was too late. loss by time limit.since when a card game lend you a fixed number of seconds to play your cards for all the battle duration?! in all card games, when it's either player's turn, the timer is reloaded! especially in this game where there are tons of effects, you'd take time (not too long) to read your cards'effects and your opponent's! this is disgusting and humiliating to lose like this...for those who are lazy, take their time to read cards or are just slow, i wouldn't recommend this game. because with this timer system, the game basically tells you to hurry the hell up and play!ps: the timer is only for pvp duels not pve ones",0

9300,"when i first played ps2, i did not care for the large open landscape and the lack of battle. well, that was before i actually played enough to get into a fire fight. picture this, you are out in an outpost. no enemy in the area, just you and your pals hanging around and bored. you hear gunfire in the distance and think, okay just an enemy squad or a sniper. you'd be wrong when an entire platoon of infantry and tanks comes rolling down the road, opening fire on you and your friends as you scramble to get a turret or find cover from the tanks blasting at you. this game can go from meh to holy hell where is a medic! on the drop of a dime. the battles are intense, the class loadouts are fair and the maps are fu**ing huge! you do not want to be caught on foot while traversing the large landscape of this game. of course the game allows in-game purchases with daycash, but also allows you to purchase the same items with in-game currency as you level up. there are no weapons that can win the war, all of them balance eachother out. vehicles are difficult to destroy, that is the only thing i see as a pain. but then again, it is a fu**ing tank! so grab some freinds, grab a vehicle and prepare for one hell of a fight. this game gets two thumbs up from me!",1

6202,"lets do some grind math real quick, average mission time 53 minutes, average payout per mission 4800 credits, cost of a new weapon 92280 credits. that translates to about 17 hours of in match game time for that new weapon assuming you and your team perform above par and you win every single one of your matches. not only that but all the parts and ammo you can buy to make your gun perform differently are going to need constant credit infusions to keep working. don't leave now theres more! all that grind is just for your primary weapon, so you burn maybe 35 - 40 hours to get that gun and all her mods. by then you have already unlocked access to the straight up better version of said gun which is even more expensive.now that im done talking about my third job, lets talk about how the game runs. graphics got lost in 2005, net code is back there with it as well. the menu, squad, and friends system don't just need work, you flip a coin at launch to see if they even do work. anyone out there have vision problems? expect white text over white backgrounds and poor advanced graphics options. game is only free to play because they know if they asked for money and showed it to the public no one would buy it.verdict 3/10 game not only barely works, it slaps you in the face with your computer.",0
2687,"used to be a good, fun game to play either by yourself or with friends.but then greed. greed ruins everything.so when i last played this game, it was a fun as heck f2p wwii dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system, was not p2w, and was well optimized with great graphics! but then i heard what they did to the game, and died a little. they revamped the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. this lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. after hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, i am not happy. this game used to be great, but then they ruined it.tl;dr i would not give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system, if they fix the system.",0

12568,"do game companies not understand, making people pay for a full game, not only, will bring them money, but it will also strengthen their fanbase, i love the devs, but they made a poor choice with the marketing for this game, it's not f2p, it's pay4fun, and if a game is like that, might as well pay full price for a game. if you have 100's of dollars to spend on it go ahead, but i just personally don't want to, and for me, the physics on this specific game aren't even that good, reletively speaking to games like assetto corsa, rfactor, and project cars, which have pretty solid physics engines (rfactor barely xd).",0

16471,"this game may cause heart problems due to the unbelievible amount of consuming hatred you'll have for this game. i don't even care for making this review so ill keep it short.the 'pros' of this tragedy are one of one things: -you get to learn all about gunsso you gun fanatic or crazed redneck who stole wifi to read this review, you'll appriciate the exstensive collection of weapons that are fully able and ready for you to field strip and re-craft (i mean down to the very last nut and bolt) buuuttt...if you want more guns to be added to your collection, or want more out of this free game, you'll be forced into putting up your hard earned money, or be culled into completing some oddly difficult challenges (for an educational game) the cons are far too overbearing however: -you'll have to complete a lengthy tutorial before getting to find that gun of your choice.-the camera angles will make your eyes want to throw up.-the point of the game is to learn and be educated in the field of firearms, yet you have to follow a 'path' of guns to get to the one you want.-and dont get me started on the in-game music! all in all, i felt like this game could have been, since its a rare title on the market right now, a shining star in the gun-friendly community for being a great big vat of sweet gun knowledge. however, it turned to a darker side of the gaming force and came out as a 'puzzle-like' game.skip this game and hop on your old pal google if you want real knowledge without the painstaking task this game provides.",0

21308,"kudos for asking am i in the minority rather than am i the only one.big roguelite veteran here. i've 100%ed isaac, ror, ror2, rogue legacy, and i'm pretty close on necrodancer.i've played nuclear throne, bpm, gungeon, wizard of legend, streets of rogue, noita, wildlands ghost mode, diablo hardcore mode, and children of morta pretty extensively. permadeath is my jam.i only recently got hades, and i'm on my 16th consecutive win out of a total of 18 wins (increasing heat, of course) - i got my first win in a pretty average number of tries; maybe around 50? after that and a couple more losses, it all kinda clicked, and it's become fairly easy. now i'm playing for the unlocks/prophecies/plot.i tried m&k early, but much like isaac, gungeon, morta, noita (which i play with m&k), and rogue legacy, avoiding hits is far more important than dealing heavy damage, so a controller gives more granularity for movement. you can only move in 8 directions with m&k and only at one speed, so that's why i use controller. there have been dozens of situations in which i would have been hit if i didn't have it. yo do lose the aim precision, but the aim assist in the game is quite intelligent and feels very nice. there have been a half dozen or so times where i wanted to aim for a trap rather than an enemy, and it gets in the way then, but otherwise, i think controller is superior.i might prefer left thumb controller, right hand mouse, but i haven't seen any devices that manage to make that feel nice, unfortunately.point bean, i think you're hamstringing yourself by playing with m&k.",1

6702,"the game devs awkwardly try to balance realism with an arcade-style shooter, and the result is a game which while fun initially has increasingly strayed from anything that could be considered enjoyable. this is not helped by the fact that most of their design decisions seem to be based around making as much money as possible, a not uncommon reality with free to play games. rather than fix bugs or ridiculous game mechanics (like people being able to jump off of speeding motorcycles and accurately shoot a bazooka within the span of two seconds, or the ability to teleport into and out of vehicles, dodging bullets in the process) they simply try to add more customization, more guns, more ribbons - fluff that adds no value to the game but lines their pockets with cash. that, and making the amount of time it takes to grind to get good weapons ever longer, an effort to encourage people to spend money on ribbon boosters and veteran membership.this game's simply becoming their cash cow. if you want to find a fun world war ii shooter it's best to look elsewhere, rather than braving the months it would take to grind up to a reasonable level to be competitive in this one.",0

690,"if you wanted to play free to play games, this one, don`t even bother playing it.this is a game where developer try to imitate counter-strike games but failed horriblely,and they dare to add the most useless, and unworthly microtransaction. only they selling is just a skin.skin that i mention is skin of a gun, emblems, and of course masks.thats it? thats what you can do on the microtransaction? super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $0.99 each?so its complete useless microtransaction, so how about the game?its a 2 gamemode only, skrimish, and elimination.skirmish is similar to team-deathmatch, only this here, is a bad skirmish game, elimination is idk vs idk counter-strike rip-off. balancing team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.guns are just a ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it fun to shoot at, here is zero fun. i didn`t enjoy at all, p90 why u too nub to shoot, shotgun, why u too op, m249, why u 1 shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. except shotgun, which is super effective.server is only in 3 channels, where player need to join the channels room to play, but i found out this is very familiar.is this a developer from 3d blockade? server was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. for me, at least on asia. i probably realized this was hosted on russia. right. i also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?hackers, yeah. it has, but is it hackable without ban? yeah. no one give a damn about banning a person. you can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? no, no one will win if someone vote no on purpose of gaining winning. ban vac? who gives a shyt, no one get ban.graphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. there`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. its like incomplete release.and lastly, did i mention the game have leveling system... talk about the useless leveling system ever created? you gain exp by winning a game. so what it does for exp? nothing. yeah nothing. zero functionality in exp. except unlocking skin which requires you 0.99$ to buy???seriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, i despite everything this game yet to offer. even though its free, you may thinking, free is the reason why you set yes as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, i feel like i need to play other game instead. i say a lot of free games like blackshot is even better than this, even a game like crazy shooter online is 20 times better, this game isn`t. its just a garbage game.there`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. i just can`t, i just wanted more biceps for playing a shooter games. in the end, games sucks. go play other free game instead.(2/10)",0

14846,"the game used to be good. trust me, you don't want to play. i've been keeping up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relating to it, only because i'm too lazy to unfollow them on facebook. the patches seem to be following the pattern i saw in the days leading up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago. i've noticed their desperate attempts to add band-aid features and balances that are meant to appease their fans and keep them around and have them pay 2 win. the dlcs aren't worth their cost at all, $35 dollars for a flyer that won't last 5 seconds in a match? lmao!! and $50 for premium? wtf?!?!? at most its worth $10! at most!i've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. and then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of hell itself. how? idk. supposedly, at some point, freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. the crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. premium was never worth the price. in the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. as a newbie back then, i can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me 6 months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. after a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. and of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than 3 colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. and after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. but thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get 1 of that item, let alone the 3 or 4 you'd need for it to be viable. and by that time, the devs would have initiated at least 4000 different metas. in the early days, everything was relatively balanced. of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. after a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). so, they did some quick patches to fix that. r.i.p. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. while that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. there were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). so, slap some tier 2 armor on, then slap some tier 7 guns on, go rek the tier 4 people, ggez. but tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. then came the flak cannons, rip flyers of all kinds. then came rockets, rip everything. then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (i forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. then came the shotguns. then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. after that i left, no surprise really. i'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since i left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than i think (which is saying something, cause i think its a ton). there's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. you want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? even the most popular robocraft youtuber, rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. really the only remaining popular robocraft youtubers are gromek999 and jac733. i can only assume that they are paid by freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, i don't know how anyone could make a positive video on robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. they could pay me $10mil a video and i still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a game. in conclusion, don't waste a single second on this game. but even more importantly, don't spend a single penny on this game, freejam doesn't deserve your money.",0

regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed.-scouts can fly by flapping their legs.-a can of soda turns you into the super-matrix; you can make bullets dodge you.-some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity.-coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer.-steel-toed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy.-whipping people makes them run faster.-a big russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an anti-tank missile as a russian t-72 tank can.-blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you.-flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker.-you can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey.-you can decapitate people with a golf club.-harmless explosives.-eating a sandvich will cure aids, mend katana wounds, and treat your erectile dysfunction.-hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it, upgrade it, and resupply it.-dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain.-a remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing.-you can shoot up morphine with a crossbow.-you can use a beam of light to turn someones exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor.-pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold.-urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher.-frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck. when they

doppelganger of you, all while you become invisible and walk away.-if you backstab someone with an icicle, theyll instantly transform into a highly-durable ice sculpture. team fortress 2 (2007-2010)this was a team-based first person shooter involving two identical teams, differing only in color and artistic design, vying for control of various strategic locales around the world. you could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes. the various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team. however, this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were (and still are) generally foreign concepts. teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases, beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms, and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit. hats were just a cool side thing. many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat. overall, team fortress 2 was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved.over 9 out of 9, worth the weight.hat fortress 2 (2010-2012)the mann-conomy update, released on september 30, 2010, marked the end of team fortress 2 and the birth of hat fortress 2. players no longer needed to idle to get hats. they could also buy them, trade for them, and even sell them for other hats. in addition, keys were also introduced, giving players the ability to throw away their parents or their own hard-earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats. more often than not, they ended up getting worthless virtual guns. the mann-conomy fever quickly swept over team fortress 2, reducing it to a side game. hat fortress 2 was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the team fortress 2 mini-game to show them off to others. the free-to-play update in 2011 further enlarged the player base, increasing the popularity of hat fortress 2, its modes, and related fun mini-games. as hat fortress 2 was further refined and developed, new elements were added, including unusuals and non-hat cosmetic items. eventually, so many new cosmetics came in that hat fortress 2 gradually evolved into another game.11 hats out of 10.dressup fortress 2 (2012-present)this is the current and ultimate form of team fortress 2. the game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play. you can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes and/or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there. you can show off your outfits, topped off with exorbitant unusual hats, in a multitude of ways. you can do the conga, hi-five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits, play intense games of rock, paper, scissors, or play jack blacks guitar. you can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old team fortress 2. you could also play mann vs. machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become the man with the golden gun. if neither of those are satisfactory, there are a wide range of other mini-games to play, some of which have been around since the days of old team fortress 2. they include, but are not limited to: versus saxton hale, freak fortress 2, jailbreak, balloon race, tf2 kart, magic spells in halloween event maps, slender fortress, surf maps, jump maps, and tf2ware. in conclusion, dressup fortress 2 does provide something for everyone, so i guess its alright.11/10 iterations of gaben. and my favorite class is the spy. thanks, and have fun!",1

15030,"i started playing this a few days ago. as a new player, i have observed that a lot of matches are one-sided stompfests. if you don't spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items, then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match. a waste of time unless you're willing to drop cash to roll for epic/legendary items before ever setting foot in a match.edit: after putting more hours into the game, i find the gameplay to be flawed. every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind, so long range weaponry is useless on most maps. this compounds the problem with the game i mentioned earlier; not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed, but you need specifically short-ranged ones. it is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps.",0

12943,"you don't even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything you've built up. i started a second game after getting a better understanding of the mechanics, got an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward, used training rooms to amp up the stats of my residents, and how was i done in? a single random group of burrowing mole rats made me burn through all of my stimpacks, and killed over half of all my characters (levels ranged from about 5 to 20 for an average of 15 or so). we're talking about the 2nd weakest enemies in the series besides radroaches here! i swear on my honor and sanity, during that same sequence that made me rage quit, i had 1 vault dweller armed with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe had armor-piercing capabilities (i uninstalled the game the second i quit so i can't confirm) vs. the last molerat in the vault, fired about 3 to 4 vollys of shots, and the rat still killed him! this would seem to suggest that standard enemies can get stronger if you don't meet some arbitrary gameplay milestones. not that you'd know given that the help section says nothing to that effect, there's no level indicator for enemies, and you also can't get a numerical value for their health, or depending on the circumstances, even a health bar! i assume this because to get feral goul attacks in my previous run, but i decided to wait on making babies to power level stats this time. the final record for how long i lasted in the game before getting royally screwed was 3 goddamn days.to clarify, after the basics have been introduced and your vault population expands new training rooms that increase stats are unlocked. this is because the only thing that leveling does is increase your character's health, but said health increase is supposedly greater if the endurance stat is increased. but just like everything else in this damn game, there's absolutely no way to know what the hell impact it's having. let me just go over the things the game will never let you know: the aforementioned extent to which endurance impacts health increase, the numerical value of the character's health, the default likelihood of anything happening when using the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or having a deathclaw randomly show up at your vault door, what stat (if any) governs melee weapons' effectiveness, how close/far a character is from building up to a critical attack, and with regards to rooms, almost everything. want to know to what extent merging rooms helps before spending money? too bad! want to know precisely to what extent increasing training room speed helps before spending thousands of caps to upgrade it? too bad! want to know if the help section (aka bethesda) is bsing you regarding training speed going faster with more people in the room? well i sure as hell didn't notice any difference. want to know whether you have the crafting resources/recipies necessary to make something in the later crafting menus before spending thousands of caps upgrading a weapon crafting room? too bad!even the radroaches can be completely absurd! get like one stuck in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and it'll be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be heard, but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and 5 to 6 can turn into 10 to 20 for no reason! and one of the rooms is literally incapable of housing residents despite being a location enemies can spawn in! and just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae, your little vault minions could only be more incompetent if they shot themselves! if an enemy walks into another room, your poor helpless flamethrower-brandishing uber-guard suffers from crippling depression that prevents him/her from pursuing due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be dragged by you every single damn time! but don't think that it ends there: melee enemies on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper-rifle weilding vault-dweller on the opposite side, and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understands that if there's one thing that a time-sensitive, resource-draining, cluster f@(# of a combat sequence needs, it's for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary locations within a room before actually opening fire, or putting out a literal fire! and on top of that, human combatants will often stumble and stagger for what feels like an eon after loosing all their health dragging out the time that resources can't be produced for even longer. thus putting you in the position of sitting there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama-queen raiders drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dwellers being equally passive, even as the sirens blare and the resource bar flashes like it's actively being depleated. i knew bethesda were hopelessly inept in most respects but i didn't think they'd find a way to screw up we're giving you this for free!think that's the end of the bs? nope. if you look through the help section, it turns out that the radio that can be used to attract people to your vault, as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door opens has the capacity to bring deathclaws charging into the vault...deathclaws. and if my experience with the molerats and roaches is any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room, never take any damage, and somehow fill my computer with malware, take money out of my account for microtransactions, and give me cancer. it's never happened to me, but again, i only ever got as far as feral gouls, so it's probably a late-game thing.with the gameplay being a mindless grindfest, the only other possible asset is story which, as one would naturally expect from a free game is nigh non-existant in terms of being a source of sincere motiveation. you're a vault, and there are people in it, the end. oh, there are quests that you can send vault dwellers out on, assuming that you can spare any of them, your valuable equipment, and you build an overseer room. even after all that you're rewarded with staring at a travel progress time for hours on end because it can take up to 30 hours (likely more since the travel times seem to increase as the quests progress and i think i recall one having a 36 hour time to start with) to get to/from a location for one mission. so good luck trying to stay invested in quests that have you sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for one or two lines of dialogue to give you any more story before making you do it all over again.and on a personal note, the game is an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because there's more incest than a southern... probably should stop now before i violate steam's guidelines regarding user posts before i finish that. but the point is, there's no amount of in-family screwing that can't occur in the game. the weirdest thing is that the game actually kind of encourages it with the mechanics... no i'm serious, character names can repeat so it's difficult to keep track of who's related to who, and it takes hours for radio calls to bring people to your vault... if they bring people to your vault. that was one of the reasons i had only like 30 to 40 characters for so long, i was trying not get parents and siblings to get down with one another. but with the way this game presents them you'd think humans were mice or something. anyway, that was just a niggling aspect that bothered me, the more substantive issue is the gameplay.i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again. if you haven't played new vegas before then my question is: what in the hell are you doing looking at bethesda to make a good fallout game?! go play new vegas instead! (i'd recommend wastland 2 but i haven't played it yet, though it's in the same vein as fallout so i guess it'd be worth a look).",0
11834,"to everyone saying it is unoptimized, you can configure the ini yourself and the game runs great. hopefully they will address this to improve the experience for those that do not know how, or are too lazy, to do this themselves. they also fixed the issue of players getting stuck on the splash screen on the official early access launch, and it was only a problem for the 2 days for those who pre-purchased. (and we were compensated for that with $20 of in game currency) i've also had a solid connection since i started playing with no lag whatsoever, so i don't know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag. as for the game, it is a blast.combat is fluid, intuitive, and makes pvp really intense. the open world factions based (like wow) pvp is always a good time. can't wait for the upcoming pvp content in the next week or two. sidequests are actually fun, but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically recieve a quest to kill that monster. (pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster, you also can gain dungeon points doing these)pet system is awesome, hilarious, and adds quite a bit of depth to the game. there are a crazy amount of pets/mounts to tame. you can upgrade pets to gain different abilities, and the same goes with mounts. you use other pets as an ingredient, but it can be a little grindy (it is an mmo). talents are really fun, and what you craft is actually valuable/worthwhile. (there is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting (; )gear can be upgraded and infused, and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more noobs. it also looks great, and there aren't just a ton of reskins of similar items. there could be more sets, but what is there is very nice.i just hope they add more content like they say they are going to, as i will be here for awhile.only complaint is nerf guardian, and add more stuff.

1720,"i have been playing this game for over a year and i have to say that before i knew about dota 2, i never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain i've ever felt. really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. the community is horrible as and so is the matchmaking. people picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute 3 (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). so i am asking myself: who in the hellinto their head for them to do such stupid things? it' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! and when there are already 4 carries, why the do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? that makes no sense! while playing dota 2 i discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. normally i'm a calm and relaxed person but dota 2 forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realized that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the , too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are s again. that's why i prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. if it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: rip! there is no more to say, really. you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up. furthermore, you will waste more or less 40 minutes of your precious time. but trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. and because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting dota 2. no, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. you can't get out of it. you are trapped in this game. it's really sad. i've tried so hard but always end up playing when i have some time.so here are my advices:1. never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.2. always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. or maybe for more flaming.3. schedule your free time. it's not only 40 minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. sometimes the whole day is ruined by dota 2. once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.4. you have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. there is no other way to endure this community.you get it? great! then i wish you guys lots of joy playing dota 2! :3",1
12886,"i did try and tire of fallout shelter back in 2015 when it came out for android. as a fallout fanboy i of course clicked again when i saw the steam debut. two years ago i got bored of the micromanagement right quick and called it a day, this time around i found the game (now) has quests and quests i have been doing for almost the entirety of my 19 hours.the game's been designed to make you buy power-ups, but as things such as vac bans are hardly an issue here, i cheat engined myself 999 nuka cola quantums and skipped any and all countdowns. some of them would have been a real pain - 11 days just to craft 1 theme to get 1/8 of an achievement, for example. did manage to get all but 3 achievements - 100 objectives, 50 raider attacks and 20 legendary dwellers are too much of a grind even for someone as pedantic as myself. human lifespans do have a limit to them.this'll hopefully be the only fallout game i'll ever give a negative review to. although shelter does get you hooked very well from the start, quests are mildy funny and it feels good to score phat loot, without hacking you wouldn't even have that. so unless you're a vampire and don't mind waiting for 14 hours for your dweller to get back - there are better fallouts, there are better micromanagement games.",0
10977,"i paid about 100 usd and climbed to gold rank in two weeks, with the win rate of 70% or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.pros:it is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. the cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving +1 +1 to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.cons:the playing itself is very dull and rng heavy and frustrating.if you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.if both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. if the opponent plays tavrod for 2 turns and you only have 1 removal, you lose.if the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn 3, you lose.if the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.if your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a steward of the past, which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.at the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. in hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm.matches are very snow-bally, one sided and rng. i feel whatever i do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome. you can try and play for free.but be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.i will come back only if they change the power system.",0

2421,"go big or go home.poe is, at its core, all about rng. rng loot drops are the core game mechanic. as one person put it fighting loot, finding monsters. the game has plenty to recommend it: great graphics, inspiring sound & music, a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character builds is nearly endless, great customisation and the best mtx system i've yet seen in a game where 95% of all items that can be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic in nature. the other 5% are quality of life items that do not in any way make poe pay to win. this is how all game companies should do microtransactions.my problem with poe is that the nature of the rng systems means that actually useful items are *incredibly* rare. the entire game economy appears to be designed with the 1% twitch broadcasters in mind who play thousands of hours of poe & nothing else. that's fine, but it essentially locks an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty walls that can only be breached by spending huge amounts of time playing. if like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff, work, family etc then i would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere. my ~500 hours (at the time of writing) have been accumulated over the past 5 years.if you're willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibilities that poe offers, and the deep meta game are very rewarding and for these players poe is the best arpg available. if however you have limited gaming time or play casually then don't bother, you're not the target audience for this game unfortunately.would i recommend poe? yes, but only because i enjoy playing with my friends. this is not a game that i play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the best gear is frankly unbelievably boring.",1

11824,"rarely write reviews but this time i really felt compelled to do so, therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably boring.short story: you should really give this game a true chance, without the pregiudice of any review (good or bad).i am so disappointed to see so many bad reviews from people that have played this game 2 hours at max, and from people that still need to get to finish the story (and/or get a decent gear).this game has potential, it is not like every other game out there, it gives you a true free-to-play option; the in-game shop is just cosmetics and you can get the in-game shop currency just by playing the game! (dungeon grinds and conversion of points in currency.)there is an anti-cheat now that has killed all the cheaters (the ones that are leaving bad reviews i can bet on it).you'll have open pvp everywhere in contested areas of the huge map. there is a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rushing end game and complain that there is no content!pvp and pve is balanced and, the pvp is truly that as most games have arena duels and matchaking bs.this game has a lot of very well done content but, as every game, has things that need to be improved.it is your choice, you can see only the bad things or you can see the good ones too, and acknowledge that nothing is as you'd wish it to be 100%.the game has performance issues as every mmo game out there; the graphics are in range with every other mmo as well.now you'll need to tweak your own .ini file to get the best out of the game graphics (it can be annoying, i understand that, but, there are hunderds of guides out there that can help you do it in 5 min) and you'll need to go into your nvidia control panel and switch the game's vram from integrated to dedicated.this game messed up badly at launch, this is very true, but at the same time, the dev team behind this game, is not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about. the dev team listens to the community and strives to improve this game every day.keep in mind that the people playing the game make the community, if the cheaters that bought this game want to leave a bad review out of spite, i cannot say anything more than to stop reading at the reviews and give this game a true chance. it is free now.nevertheless i'll keep buying my premium membership (which doesn't give any p2w advantage) to support the devs, because this game deserves to be succesful more than bdo (owned), tes:o (owned) and whatever mmorpg you can think about (i have played them all).p.s. even though most people got refunded the purchase of the game, they still complain. you'll have to decide for yourselves who's in bad faith, but for as far as i can tell it is not the dev team. i am just tired of people donwvoting games that deserve tho shine while upvoting trash games.",1

919,"do you like moba gameplay such as dota 2, league of legends, hon and other similar games?but you also like biging spaceships with bigguns shooting fiery balls of doom and lasors at other spaceship?than this is the game for you, wait no longer and install now!!basicly you're going 5 vs 5 with a spaceship of your choice, capturing points and eventually trying to capture the enemy base. the more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over the enemy ships. currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.i can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use azerty keyboards, because the controls are for qwerty which means you control the ships movement with zqsd instead of wsad. you can fix this by pressing alt+lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly. all in all, great game, i am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps and modes to play.i rate it 7.5/10",1

3081,"tl:dr; great game being tarnished by bad development practices (fpe/parts debacle as of late is a good example of it)to start, this game is fantastic. currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat, and ships/helicopters entering closed beta testing. no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone (arcade for 'casuals' and realistic battles for more 'hardcore' players)engine is utterly fantastic for any game, moreso a f2p game. absolutely amazing performance on any system, can almost run on your microwave, while having great graphics on the highest settings. only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the config file but it's pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally isn't neccesary. i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is, in my opinion, one of the best f2p games on the market. but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others, even if i continue to play the game.why? because gaijinthey have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up, and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them. outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle, such as the ru-251. they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with ge purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it. special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection (fp), which parts are needed to repair your tank after it's damaged (which happens alot) and fp is needed to put out fires. these parts can each take 50-100 battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock.for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome. a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for gameplay and grinding were mentioned, and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind. this video then, unsurprisingly, received ~5k downvotes versus ~1k upvotes. comment section filled with people calling out gaijin and saying parts/fp should be free and not ground out for.then anywhere it removing the grind for parts/fp on a gaijin operated platform the discussion is censored. this parts/fp isn't the first nor last time gaijin perform a practice like this. i can not recommend people who haven't played this game to do so, you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into gameplay hampered by greedy practicesif gaijin ever turn this around, starting by somehow reducing/removing the parts/fp grind then i will change the reccomendation to a yes",0

2474,"welcome to war thunder, the game where b-17s can get shoot down by a russian biplane, let's get started.things i like:- realistic flying mechanic- damage modules-both planes and tanksand that's it.now, let's get to the things i hate.- balance -> this game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: usa, uk, germany, japan and russia, now, the real problem (seen from a usa main) is that every nation exept for usa and maybe uk is overpowered, especially russia.it might be me, but i think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 us bomber.- teammates -> altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will steal your kills and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds )))- bombers -> as a us bombers main, i realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially b-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the b-17 is probably one of the weakest. and it's kinda strange, since in real life, the b-17 was one of the best bombers.- russia -> every russian plane\tank is overpowered, i litterally got bored of playing as us and constatly get shot down by russia that i tried to play russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.-every tank that's not russian seems to have armor made of cardboard, you can literally shoot at least 10 times at a russian tank and you won't do anything to it, then you get destroyed by like 5 machine gun rounds from a russian tank.the usual joke about this game is that it is russian biased, well guess what? it ing is!people ofter ask is this game pay to win? of course it isn't, it's play russia to win.so, if you don't like to loose, grab your sekrit dokumints, put on your tracksuit and your ushanka, choose your russian plane made of stalinium and spam &quot everywhere you can and put on kalinka or the russian march of red alert 2, oh, don't forget to write xaxaxaxaxaxa ))) after every kill. now that you know how to play russia in wt, you're ready to go tovarish.",0

24773,"gaming communities aren't all just one big community though so that's a difficult thing to say. take any match based game like any shooter or rocket league or among us or whatever. everyone are strangers unless you're playing with friends. so it's not really about other males don't call out their bad behaviour because males is an extremely diverse group of people whose single and only commonality is their sex. in one game you may have a lot of issues because it's full of similar immature dumbarses, and in others you may get no problems. the normal people from game b can't exactly tell the dipshit weirdo in game a to stop being creepy. in-game voice chats are basically always toxic as fuck as a general rule, it's why i just play with friends only. no way in hell would i join a public game with a bunch of randoms and have in game voice on. it's just not fun. now if we start to talk about actual communities then you see way less problems because no one likes shit in their own home. if a person is lacking friends who play games, then either finding a discord community, or playing a game which is community focused, like wow or even destiny where you actually have guilds you join. and so long as they've got real people in them and aren't just a group of kids, there's going to be very few issues. in the better part of a decade or more all actual communities/groups i've been in have all had girls, no one is weird because the weird people end up getting the boot pretty quickly if they don't stop being weird. once you already have a group of people that know each other, no one stands for some random person joining who starts being sexist or creepy. they're going to get flicked instantly. but if you're in random matches with random people, i'm sorry but you simply can't stop it. if you're in the lobby with 90 other people before a pubg match there's no one that can call something out, because everyone is just being stupid. if a person doesn't like that then you've just gotta turn off voice chat. places like that you cannot control, it's wild west. if you want a nice place then you need a group of friends or a guild or group you can join to just chill and play games with. and then you're not gonna get any issues. so i wholly agree it'd be nice if we could just make all these people no be creeps, but you can't control other people, all you can do is control yourself and who you hang around. and that's where friends and good guilds / groups come in.",1

3801,"i made my steam account specifically for tf2 back in the day, and there was a long time i'd just play this game for 8 hours every day of the week. i loved tf2 to death, i can still remember how happy i was when i first found a hat or when i uncrated something good. the best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. it seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. it was great.those days are completely gone though. this year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. i feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. the last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. the war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. what about the new content for pyro? pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. team fortress 2 just feels dead. in the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much i hadn't even tried yet. now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.i have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone i know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. i know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. i know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. step up your game.",0
2633,"the game as it is pretty good. i would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher / dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent. events are just tedious, mind numbing grinding. a recent event required you to do over 100 games within 3 days to get a tank or plane. or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for 40 bucks. ground forces (tanks) is even more grinding than air forces. it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation. or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money. the ground forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank. for example: you have to research fire extinguishers. that can take a decent amount of games. especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank. while you watch. being unable to do anything. or well, you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money you have to train your crew. not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to 6 (?) crew members in tanks. you have to train every single one of them individually. or you spend some bucks on them. air rb battles are unchanged since the game came out. they are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks. you often come out with just as much sl (in game currency to buy stuff) as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs their balancing methods are just bad. instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week, they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank (or plane for that matter) for months again. naval forces have been in closed access (meaning you have to pay to play them) for over a year now in the steam screenshots you can see u-boats. there are no u-boats in the game. they only have been in the game for one day (april fools)the list goes on. that's just what i have in my mind right now. you can take a look at more posts like these:/r/warthunder general rant/r/warthunder about repair costs/r/warthunder about their horrible pr/r/warthunder about repair costs ii",0

5963,"if you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game. like others have mentioned , the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying , it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying. but then the experience is really rewarding. if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process. now in my book there are 3 types of fans when it comes to flying games . lets see ...1- the first type only want to grab the stick (or keyboard) and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else. if you are from this type then go for battlefield series , hawx or war thunder..etc. don't bother with dcs . you will have hours of fun with the other titles that i mentioned. and trust me , there are some really good ones out there and i've personally tried most of them . 2- this type of fans love flying and don't mind getting into some details about planes but they don't want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details. if you belong in this category , look up flaming cliffs 3 on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading. 3- these are plane nerds. they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane. they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so. if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading ? go download dcs and have fun . thank me later. now ... if you are the first type ... don't bother with dcs. there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun. dcs is for the other 2 types . if you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. dcs has non-clickable cockpits in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. but here is the thing. you can by fc3 and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for dcs you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the 2 included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but keep reading .finally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where you actually need to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because dcs not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to fsx or fg and see the difference. as a final note , some say the planes are expensive. i believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the dcs' website. usually you can by all planes for %70 off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . i say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with dcs:fc3 . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.",1

(google this for more info)4. the game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyimao:1. honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.2. deck sizes should be increased to 30 minimum3. card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the f2p ultra rare card discrepancy.4. i could list more serious problems caused by konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things i hate the most about the game.in closing, if i see one more fully loaded blue eyes deck i'm going to vomit!",0

4416,"winning or losing is entirely determined by your connection error, or rather the server's connection which is so flimsy it could go either way. the game lags and has a lot of talking npcs and unncessary click steps yet has a timer. which means they must've intended the game not to be played as yugioh, but as a completely arbitrary gamble and the yugioh cards are there for aesthetic and to trick idiots into buying gems.overall it is more balanced than real yugioh, but that's because real yugioh is everything you should not do in a card game. with so much dependent on first hand cards, spells/traps only existing as complimentary utility, and a lot of power creep from set to set, it wasn't hard to make this game at all more competitive by just tightening the board and changing set rotation down to hand selected cards that aren't all that good in the real format. what this is, is yugioh where they only correct their own bad game design by limiting cards that broke the real game as either extraordinarily rare (again, to trick idiots) and leaving the meta complete hogwash because of consistency constraints and tight board management making a lot of archetypes obsolete.yugioh as a game is all about the rareity and power creep of a card, so in essence this fixes that by makingservers that run on a atari 500 and insuring most players never even see the really broken stuff they've made over the years. but if you're expecting to duel hardcore, make friends, do really anything besides wait around for the server to crash and get a loss for it... you'll need to play another card game. which i can't even recommend to you one because the industry is just so unconcerned with improvement and actually in-depth gameplay they're all just as bad. if i could give it a rating instead of just a recommendation i'd rate it two stars because it's like some evil genie wish of technically fixing yugioh, but in the most contrived way possible. it's like these programmers work harder to aggravate and troll than they do making a game.",0

11909,"can't recommend the game right now. (edit below)to name a few reasons why:- the game is unoptimized. heavily. probably the most unoptiomized game i've played in years. the graphics and visuals are okay, but even when you have a 1080ti - i7 - 16gb of ram and good hdd, it stutters, lags, textures take a bit to load every time on characters, menus seem to stutter the game when you open them.- the server issues are bad, too. frequent disconnects, i've tried on both 20/20 and 50/50 vdsl. didn't matter one bit. if there are too many connections, there's good chance you'll be stuck at splash screen, no matter your connection. the game doesn't try to reconnect again and you're forced to restart the game. that might also happen if you randomly disconnect after finally getting in, so atm you have a chance to be one of the lucky ones to not be disconnected, or be the unlucky ones who gets to play 20mins out of 4h you spend logging in.- the translation is pretty bad. i suppose it could be forgiven, if the devs didn't say they spent 60 millions on getting the game to na/eu.- the combat system was dumbed down. if you're looking for an experience similiar to bdo or even tera, you won't get it, not afaik anyway. i looked and looked and couldn't find the action combat option in menus, while it was there in jp version. right now the na/eu version has tab targetting, and sometimes it doesn't work.- the voice over half the time sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom with an old mic too close to mouth, it's terrible.i think that's all. and if the devs really improve the optimization, server issues and translations, i'd happily change this review and try the game again, but atm, for the price, bless online is not worth leaving other mmo's for.edit: - the game is still broken af. the recent nerf of damage brought all classes to 50-75% dmg nerf which makes main story quests undoable as dps.- the marketplace is set in the same way as gw2 marketplace. there are no set prices.- there is no account-shared storage. also there is no player-to-player trading.- the game has huge memory leak, taking 7-13gb of ram when just on.here's a report of doing the first lvl 13 dungeon as 4 classes, two dps, tank and healer.",0

10214,"once you get over the fact that this game is not in spirit a, free to play, it is one of the best hunting simulators in current day. you have to buy a basic membership if you plan on enjoying this game. so you have all licenses & ammunition without either expiring. in hindsight, the membership is actually cheaper then your average mmorpg, which charges you at average $15 a month. thehunter only asks for $31 for the entire year. or if you want extra stuff to work with, $50 for the trailrunner, and you can keep everything in the package even after it expires.the animals do not interact with each other realistically like in deer hunter season 2005, but even with that, the game is still extremely enjoyable especially in its multiplayer. making new friends in this game is very easy and motivates you to hunt newer species, explore more of the reserves, and try out different ways of hunting.also, this is not a run & gun arena shooter game like call of duty. so if you have the patience span of a gnats d*ck, you'll hate this game.so understand specifically that this is not a total free game. but the asking price is not terrible either especially with the content that can be explored. buying things in the game is optional. some things you do need but can buy in packs.duck hunting you do need the callers or you cannot hunt ducks. camoflauge plays a big deal in it too. so if you plan on spending money in spots for different hunting, then plan out where you'll spend it without going broke. manage your cash, is all i can tell you.so, give thehunter a chance. or if you're too broke then you will not be able to enjoy this game.",1

6494,"im just straight done with this game, totally done.here is the list why1, hackers, even though the forums will deny up and down that they have seen a hacker in game for nigh 2 years or so. they exist (id almost bet the deniers are hackers) when someone can take a machine gun, one that should have the worst recoil and accurracy at distance, and fires at a full speed moving jeep, and 1 shots the full health gunner(with heavy set medal at gold) with a head shot from clearly away from easy sight. the likelyhood of that just being a really skilled player is slim to none, its totally bs.2, dev bias, the developers have a clear bias for certain factions, regularly when a update comes out, its for the german or soviet faction, never the allied. go ahead, take a look, find the last time they announced any kind of weapon or vechicle update highlighting something for the allied faction. if you find it, id bet its all the way back in early days of production. and with that bias comes...3, unbalanced factions, you will regularly hear any allied player complain about being 1 shot with a gewer in the chest. and yet it is 100% impossible for any allied gun to return that favor. the amount of pure damage guns outside of the allied faction can deal is unbelivable. its rediculous and makes the game completly impossible, hell you cant even get a decent scope for a sniper. vehicles all have this same problem. allied armor is weak in comparison, last i checked, thats not how the war went. this used to not be as much of a problem a long while back when you could buy the weapons the enemy faction had, as your starting weapon. well they took that right the fk out. now there is just a wall of bullets you better hope you can get around.4, devs just dont care, the devs are just cold and uncaring, i had an issue where they did a big update, and it wiped out all of my xp for my sniping gun, i made a support ticket, i think i waited 3 months till i actually heard something back, by then i had uninstalled the game. the devs response? oh yeah we will fix that in a rolling patch later, heres a camo skin for your trouble oh and the only unlocked it, i still had to buy it with in game money.this game should be ripped from steam, just look at the mixed reviews, even hardcore vets of this game are just done with the nonsense. dont waste your life on this soon to be washed up studio and their cut rate biased game.",0

2636,"the good: game is marvelpiece from technical standpoint - beautiful graphics, good sound and all is well optimised. tank and aircraft models are very detailed, there is considerable customisation as well. plethora of vehicles, real and paper projects to toy with.the bad: balance isn't the best, with worst offender being top tiers, particularly jets. aircraft gameplay resolves around destroying ground targets, so if you're up for fighter to fighter combat, you won't win many games. tank gameplay is one shot in nature, as often single penetrating shell is enough to kill crew and/or detonate ammo racks, which leads to rather campy gameplay. arcade mode with its respawn is both boon and curse - if one team collapses, it inevitably leads to spawnkilling. realistic is aquired taste, unfortunately driving/flying for few minutes only to die in boom isn't exactly my flavor.the ugly: grind. on positive, you can research entire tech tree using only one vehicle. in theory, in practice its unlikely to happen before heat death of universe. player progress is deliberately slowed down by need to research and buy at least 6 vehicles of current tier before progressing, which doesn't stop less competent players from playing more advanced toys. obtaining your oh so expected new toy, be it tank or plane is only the beginning - after all you've bought junk of a vehicle and you need to upgrade it and with tanks (and upcoming warships) its especially bad. you can't repair your tank and you can't extinguish fires without researched spare parts and fire ex. while on low level vehicles its matter of few battles to get these, on top tiers it can take well over 50 battles to get anything, with hundreds of battles needed to unlock all upgrades.p2w - while there are no premium vehicles that are straight up overpowered (at least i'm not aware of them), there are plenty of options to gain advantage with open wallet. first - instantly buying upgrades for vehicles, its not so much p2w as its sanity saviour, especially on high tier vehicles. second - crew. for gold eagles you can level up crew considerably, especially in sensitive aspects like vitality or reload speed. third - increasing vehicle rooster. free player can bring up to 5 vehicles into battle, paying player can bring 10. so should arcade air prove so hectic, paying player can in theory outlast non paying ones. arcade tanks are limited to 3 vehicles, so no issue there if one can prepare his/her lineups correctly.tl;dr if you can accept grind and/or limiting yourself to early vehicles and you're willing to learn basics (especially air combat), go for it.",0

13240,"short review:i think this is a good game, but if you are looking to sate your hex/square tactics thirst for free, go play card hunter. it is a better game.things that make this game good: the art is pretty great. everything has character and detail. the colors are nice and cheery. if you love tactics games like this, there is about 40 hours of solid content before you start wondering if you have seen everything, and 40 hours of enjoyable playtime for free is all i need to know to give this a thumbs up. basically there are about 5 or 6 different game modes, and for me it took these 40 hours to believe i understood how each one works.bad things: there are some people that have either bought their way to the high levels or have inherited a long standing account from pre-release days, but if you look through all the clans, i find very few people who make it past level 10. it may just be that this game only came out a month ago, but i feel that there is a really solid paywall that you hit around level 9.the main issue i have with this game is that the way the payment system is constructed, it is kind of like a free-to-try / pay-to-win thing here. this is because your characters level up with cards, and you can buy cards with money. sure, i know that the developers have to make money, but i don't think this is the best way. in my short review at the top of this, i mentioned card hunter. one of the things which card hunter does exceptionally well i think is that you spend money not on advantages over other players, but on bonus content - unlocking new dungeons and such.a few other things: it is a bit deja vu-ish that many of the characters in this game feel like they were either ripped out of warcraft, put through a heroes of might and magic 3 filter, and pulled into a game named tactical monsters. i sometimes wonder if the actual developer is some guy who made monsters for blizzard or just another guy like me that still plays homm3 all the time and wonder if maybe they can't do better than ubisoft. i mean, you can't do any worse right?it could also just be a testament to how influential these games have been that they have possibly become fantasy tropes. i.e. the harpy, the grunt, the gobin shredder, the night elf archer, the elf riding a tiger, and on and on.",1

3635,"team fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from valve.the gameplay is somewhat similar to counter-strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike counter-strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. the game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. you can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. and the best thing about his game is hats! yes, hats. most every damn people here on steam loves them. you can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! many people make profit from it, many people collect it.team fortress 2 graphics is 3d but with cartoon style. even though the graphics is cartoon, team fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects. all effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized.this is great free to play game for me, i highly recommend it. play it now!rating 9/10",1

2121,"of exile: an action rpg similar to style and feel of great titles like diablo 2. path of exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other arpgs. from the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of wraeclast itself, its a unique enough experience that i havent encountered anything quite like path of exile before. its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of arpgs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement. the game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. the story and lore of wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most arpgs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. the game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other arpgs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. overall the experience of path of exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. personally, i would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. as a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully i can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these wont feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. path of exile is a great arpg, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and its all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -double thumbs up from royialvideo reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/royialnetwork",1

5660,"as a hardcore flight combat simulation, dcs can't be beat by anything else out there. so much has already been said about the flight modeling, the graphics, the maps and effects, and the modules already - but the beauty of the system is that you can get as simple or as complex as you want, and you can mix and match modules to suit your needs. want to simulate 1944 wwii and the normandy invasions? there modules for that. want to simulate flying korean war situations? there's modules for that (except for a korea map). want to simulate gulf war situations? there's modules for that. fly planes off airfields or aircraft carriers, strafe or drop bombs on static or mobile targets, engage in air to air with guns or missiles. or simply fly around and check out the scenery.in my case, i set out to simulate my experiences with jane's f/a-18e (from way, way back). so i purchased the persian gulf map and the f/a-18c package (which is so, so much more advanced than the jane's model was almost 18 years ago now). the price tag of the modules was a bit intimidating, yes - but after flying the f/a-18c for as much as i have it was worth every penny. i picked up the a-10c as well, and it's just as fun.i also fly exclusively in vr. the only issue with that is spotting - there are aids to assist with spotting planes which does help immensely. but there's no substitute really... flying the f/a-18c off the carrier, flying a mission, and returning to land on the carrier is amazing in vr.if you are a flight combat sim enthusiast, and like to fly modern jets, there really is no other platform out there that compares. there are, however, some important things that you need to keep in mind: there is a steep learning curve, particularly with the more detailed modules (f/a-18c, a-10c, f-14, blackhawk, etc.). this is not a simulation where you can simply hop in a plane / chopper, fire it up, and fly loops around others. it takes time, effort, and lots of training and learning systems to fly these well - but it's extremely rewarding once you've put in the time. dcs world is a graphically intensive game, and has a lot of background stuff going on (particularly the campaign missions) that requires a good video card and a beefy cpu. you will need a decent gaming rig to get good frame rates - particularly so if you plan on trying it with vr. you cannot fly this simulation with a controller. just... don't. if you're serious about this, get a hotas. ch pro, thrustmaster warthog, etc. some of the newer modules are still works in progress, like the f/a-18c. updates are frequent however, and new systems are being added all the time until the module(s) is completed (currently this applies to the f/a-18 and the f-14). dcs has a huge online community, and offers many, many groups or squadrons to fly with that offer just about any situation you want to experience, be it pvp, co-op, co-op campaigns, or a mixture of all of it. dcs is moddable, and has a huge amount of mods available that enhance the graphics, or missions, or environment, or just about anything else. the built-in mission editor is fairly simple to use - but it is extremely robust and has advanced capabilities that allow for very detailed and complex setups that can create extremely detailed missions and campaigns. some of the modules (like the l-39 albatross and the f-14 tomcat) allow for 2 players to simultaneously fly in the same aircraft - either for training or radar systems and weapon usage. as cool as this is, it's even cooler in vr. some of the modules are pricey, considering other flight simulation packages. however, the game does come with the caucasus map free, and you can purchase less complex aircraft modules (like the f-15 or the mig-29) if the more complex and pricey modules don't appeal to you.if any of this appeals to you, download dcs today and give it a try. the base package is free and comes with the su-25 frogfoot (a ground attack aircraft), the p-51, and the caucasus map. that will give you a taste of the dcs world package and what you can expect from it. additionally, there are a ton of videos on youtube that answer just about any question you might have about the sim, a given airplane, or most everything else.get it. fly. have a blast.",1

3608,"2010team fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. first of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like heavy, soldier, and scout. the vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the heavy is the slowest, the scout is the fastest, and the medic is normal speed.classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. the medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. this will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the solider, is faster than the medic.the level design is beautiful, but take two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. but some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line,the fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. for example, the heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. it seems similar to mario kart, with the various courses and powerups. however, it fails to capture the fun of mario kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and blandthe major flaw in tf2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. there are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. valve did include a map that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. these maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.while the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. i wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this pc-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.",1

1651,"2017:did not play much for this year due to work.2016:after 5 years of dota 2, all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, monkey king is coming out in december this year.dota 2 has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as basketball and football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win. through the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely scans and cheaper more defensive items.new items such as echo sabre and hurricane pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.everything can workas a whole, dota 2 has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand. no particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. be it eg's methodical lane dominance and calm style, mvp phoenix's all-in teamfight style, ehome's strategic drafting style, or ti6 winners - wings' anything goes style.valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for dota 2 and virtual reality support for spectating. overall, its been a good year for dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.2015:over the course of a year, dota 2 has slowly introduced its source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of warcraft 3's battle.net. the international 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.it is also clear that dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being december holidays, chinese new year and halloween. with regards to porting over dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: arc warden and pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.at this point, the longevity of dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to valve's steam client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.icefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with valve for dota 2's future back in 2010. i hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.2014:dota 2 just keeps improving over time. at the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. the community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. the cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. as a competitive game oriented towards esports, dota 2's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and the international's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. it has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.dota 2 has also recently implemented ranked matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an elo-style rating. while it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. it is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.2013:valve inc. has proven that they will continue to support dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. the game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.matchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.2012:dota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment. free to play! all heroes are free and available. items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit dota 2's medieval setting.2011:this is a game for the competitive pc gamers. dota 2, the sequel to dota features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. the ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make dota 2 a complete game experience. no two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other aaa pc games out there. this game is a definite buy for me. what will it be for you?",1

1462,"update: 1 year and 125 hours of gameplay later and this game has risen to my all time favorites list. matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base. new and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so). visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before. a lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad. it's just heavily focused on grinding. but the devs are active and listening, so i would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months. i would like to also comment on a complaint i've heard a lot: no, this game is not pay-to-win! lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that only change aesthetics. now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved. challenge accepted! now go play fractured space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - original review below:only had the chance to play one round so far but from what i can tell i'm really going to like this game. there is definitely an initial learning curve, since i didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun i've ever had losing! the ship textures are beautiful! the weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome! i'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it). my only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes. i have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, i'd see the network connection tank. would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going. died a couple times because of that. (not a problem with my network btw. it handles all other online games including bf4 flawlessly). i'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that i was just playing on a bad server). all in all, this is a really fun game. the sort of game i've been looking for a long time. it's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars. i'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it. i would definitely recommend it!",1
6742,"this game is still being developed, i understand that.however, from watching dev streams lately as well as playing since beta release i have come to the understanding that the us is favoured most of all, followed by the germans and then the ussr gets what's left.this is shown in a number of examples, both in gameplay mechanics and in available weapons (and their stats).the us seems to spam every match with tanks and other armoured vehicles (which are either too hard or too expensive to counter), the germans tend to do the same followed by the ussr and their underwhelming vehicles and expensive at weapons. also, on release, the ussr was started from scratch progression-wise wheareas the us and german factions were comfortably in the lead with many, many tank drivers, pilots, recon and the like. this forced a painful attempt to progress in battles as the ussr due to being very under-powered in the various ways previously mentioned.yes! i realise this is a freemium game. they 'need' to make money somehow i hear you all say, but really??!f2p is slow and for the ussr completely not worth it (not to mention not at all worth it for any faction after a certain rank or set of weapon upgrades due to the negative costs for playing a match( even for very skilled players)) and that it what sucks about this game, money-grabbing. in order to progress or have decen chances at competing you must buy into the game and that is terrible. why offer a f2p model when it's secretly forcing you to buy in to its pricey premium account??now don't get me wrong, i have enjoyed aspects of this game. the weapons available are cool and the maps are large and varying but the cons seem to outweigh the pros. atleast in my own opinion.pros:decent map sizesgood selection of weapons etcfairly accurate historiclygood game for a groupcons:poor mechanicsunbalanced factionsexpensive itemssubtly forced premium attemptlack of voiplack of competent playerbase\communication",0
1740,"to fully illustrate what makes dota one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.dota has its roots as a warcraft 3 modification. warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of hero units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. this really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. to a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. it was a brilliant concept, and dota took it a step further.dota created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard rts format. it's one of the best examples of less is more than i've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game i've ever played.i've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. there are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. in the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. it's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than dota, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! it's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. this is what keeps me coming back, and i'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. if you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my youtube channel. thanks for reading!",1

11558,"oddly enough, this game has helped me, a console player, transition from controller to m/k. the netcode on this game is absolutely fantastic. in just over 20 hours of playtime, i've not once felt like i've been cheated by lame hit detection or dsync issues. as someone who needs all of their shots to count, this was a huge selling point for me. personally, i enjoy the dedicated spawns as it gives me an idea of where the enemy will be coming from. you can still flank and outmaneuver, but for the most part, it comes down to who has the best aim. no p2w here, as all guns can be purchased for either gold or medals. both of which can be earned just by playing the game. you can buy weapons outright for real money, but from what i have seen, there is no gamebreaking weapon in the game. however, if you feel like there is a weapon that is constantly killing you and you currently don't have the means to purchase said weapon, you can download the 15 day dlc weapon packs for free and try out each gun, helping you to see which gun you should spend money on next. i mainly play tdm, and have noticed the maps to be quite small with multiple maps being set up like a paintball course (one room with obstacles spread throughout). overall, i would say to give this game a try. i've never played csgo, but this has got my interest up.",1

(that could be fixed) some skill descriptions are nearly impossible to understand even what a skill does, especially for paladins.not as serious, but the chat log censorship was just downright hilarious. odd words are censored, such as 'ag' and 'horse' and as a game with mages and horses in it, its very laughable; but it also fails to censor the words that actually should be censored..only worth purchasing when optimization is fixed and the simple kinks are flattened out.",0

[edit: you might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit, but you still die instantly once it's started to plummet.]fighter planes have little to no variety, and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls.players earn a miniscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing, and would need to play one battle every day for 294 days in order to purchase the lowest-ranked war bond in the shop, which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to 310 days' worth of first-battle bonuses over half a year. meanwhile, the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of 350 days' worth costs under $8 usd.for whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in early release, still, please note that this is a personal opinion and an early release review, on top of that, meaning that as more patches are added, this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time. as it stands, though, i cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highly-experienced or skilled player, but also the one who throws money at it.and yes, i did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point.",0
15561,"first off all let's start with how aqw 2d has released items that do effect gameplay, and to make it worse these items go rare. they have xp boost items, gold boost items, rep boost items, and class boosts items. most are locked behind being a member and paying a fee, or buying ingame currency to purchase these pay to win items before they go rare. now this leads me to aqw 3d. the 2d game is unbalanced so why make a 3d version now? that kind of screams give me your money. most things are super overpriced as it is. you have ultra hats in aqw 2d that cost 5,000 adventure coins. that is essentially 20 dollars for a super long hat... wtf? why...? i get that it's up to the player to buy these things and they have a choice, but to list something that high is kind of a joke to be honest. why are you developing this 3d game when your 2d game is still in crisis? most ppl pay lots of money just to enjoy and collect things from ae games lets be honest. so if you're prepared to spend lots of money to be at the degree of other players then go ahead play this game. this games micro transactions is almost a reminder of what destiny 2 is not becoming. not a lot of things amazingly worth farming, most good items you pay for, and most items that are good to farm for are not ac tagged, so they take up vault space. then you have to pay for that space in your vault with real money. go back and fix your other games first please.",0
13102,"this game is both fun and stupid. i recommend this game because you can play its full potential without paying*fun, cute little graphics with a familiar fallout theme. a slight tiny tower type of dweller management and room upgrades. an addition of quests, funny dialogue and sometimes difficult missions makes this game pretty dang enjoyable.i played this game as long as i did only to complete all achievements with that being said, i'm going to help you get them all.note: there is almost no way you can earn all 35 achievements without paying (or cheating). i was able to get 34/35 by with some patience and allowing the game timer to run overnight and during the day. im only listing a few of the non-obvious achievements, or, some difficult ones with tips that might help you get them a bit faster. keep in mind to check your vault in the morning and at night. should take several weeks to complete them all.quest achievements:---big pharma (collect 100 stimpacks)---decorator (collect all pieces of 4 themes)---survivalist (complete 60 quests)the key with these is to constantly have dwellers on 3 quests at a time.time-consuming achievements:---fashion statement (collect 20 legendary outfits)---armed and dangerous (collect 20 legendary weapons)---interior designer (craft 1 of every room theme)with these, keep x1 outfit and x1 weapon being made at all times. they must be legendary and keep in mind what type of special is needed to make it go faster (this depends on what you are making.) also keep the crafting room themes going at all times as well.the two hardest achievements:---get off my lawn (stop 50 raider attacks)the reason im stating this as a hard achievement is because if you progress too fast, raider attacks become very few and far between; raider attacks depends on the quantity of dwellers you have. 1-39 dwellers = raider attacks. 40-79 dwellers = raider, ghoul attacks. 80+ dwellers = raider, ghoul and deathclaw attacks.with this being said; 70+ hours in, i stayed steady at about 190 dwellers and completed all but the blast from the past and get off my lawn. i was at 37/50 attacks and i was only getting attacked by deathclaws. i saved my game, made a backup and evicted all but 39 dwellers. i got attacked by raiders 3 times within an hour. (changed the game to windows mode swapped from chrome to the game every 10 min) a pain i know  but i recommend staying around 30 dwellers until you get about 40 raider attacks, then im sure youll get them all later---blast from the past (collect 20 legendary dwellers)*ok, honesty time here. at about 75 hours in; i was about to give up hope. i had two achievements left, get off my lawn and this one. also, at this point, i didnt spend a dime on the game. i researched how to get legendary dwellers and, besides earning 1 or 2 from quests, you can get them all from lunch boxes. so i thought to myself self, you threw down 75 hours of free play, buy a few lunch boxes  however, $5-$10 bucks doesnt get you much, and what lunch boxes it got me didnt help. so i obtained a save file with 999 lunch boxes and went to town opening- with 999 lunch boxes, clicking to open them for several hours and bam, 485 lunch boxes later, i got the achievement. so this means: (from my own experience)485 / 20 = approx. 0.04% drop rate per box485 * 5 = 2,425 cards (there are 5 cards per lunch box)2425 / 20 = approx. 0.008% drop rate per cardthe reason im saying all this is because if you plan on buying lunch boxes just for this achievement, then you may want to rethink it. i also feel cheap cheating to earn achievements, but bethesda has earned enough of my money over the years. they can take one for the team; i sure the hell did with fallout 4",1
10622,this game has so much done right. eliminated a lot of the rng hstone cards bring .. yet fast play as hstone provides and extra depth that mtg elements bring and yet they failed to improve on the broken land mechanic of mtg. its one thing to win or loose a game because you are drawing badly .. or well .. yet to be completely eliminated from the match because 7 lands come up in a row ... i dont know .. mtg is amazing but after all these years you cant tell me someone cant come up with something better because its insanely archaic. i have build decks explicitly on empower mechanics and yet there is enough stun / removal so that if you are only drawing lands .. you are dead in the water. it just seems to happen to often. other than that the game is incredibly free to play and has done so much so well ... but the sigil / land mechanic hasnt evolved at all in 25 years.i still think this game is actually great but dayum the land draw is simply horrible and should be a side effect / board.,1

4018,"meet your match is a mess of an update, but i believe that tf2 will pull through, like time and time before, again.many balances have been for the better, and for the not as well thought out ones, underlying them lies a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward.to all the minor class and weapon rebalances,i appreciated spy and pyro buffs, valve recognized that pyro and spy were underpowered.a health buff for pyro (185) instead of or in addition to its dps buff would be better suited to its current role in tf2 i believe however.natascha and huo long were nerfed and buffed nicely.sun on a stick might actually see some use now (maybe).other good rebalances include widowmaker, short circuit, disciplinary action, eureka effect, overdose (as a medic main, i get and like what valve is trying to do here).the point i'm trying to make, is that from all the rebalances, one can see that valve really is taking the time to understand how this game is played.with that in mind, here are some of the major problems i see and how valve can fix them.casual: it's a good idea, the only problem being it is no longer casual.you cant join friends in the middle of a game anymore.and the servers they assign you to have terrible pings where i am.all the good players who like to mess around stopped playing and all the terrible players started tryharding.an easy way to fix this is bringing back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by looking through server list or the join game button and voting systems to extend current map/match-up.comp: should be available for all players who have played above a certain amount of hours instead of just for those who paid for the game.if one or two hour farmers get through it wont matter because valve could easily use their ranking system to pair people with similar skill levels together. if you arent good, doesnt matter how much you game the system, you're stuck at bottom.comp needs class limits.maybe 2 for each assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as to keep the game dynamic.(read up on the metagame and watch some matches before you ask why)medic speed buff is stupid. increases survivability of medic, encouraging stalemates in comp (medics feel safer, less urgency to push from winning team).reduces the fun in playing medic because you get to be sloppier in your positioning, less good at dodging which is basically all medic is about.scout did -not- need another buff (or whatever this was to scout)it sounds like it makes sense travel at the same rate of the player you are healing but it's actually really gimmicky, basically boiling down to heal scouts to go fast because they are only class faster than medic.despite the above, potential players, dont be put off. tf2 is still a miracle of a game: the chemistry between all the classes work so well, it is incredibly fun to play and getting good is really satisfying.besides, there's always community servers to tide this over (cp_orange, jump maps, mge, 24/7 dustbowl hightower)",1
2957,"yes, the game is really fun and addictive. at 918+ hours i can say it is a true pay to win game. i do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money. there is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for xp so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ton of nickel and dimes. you will earn those same xp during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp. it takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in tank battles). good luck earning xp by just playing. long story short, this game sucks for pvp because of pay to win. but is the best i have seen in a while for what i call eye candy (realistic looking models and fx) and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.ps. i would accept war thunder gold lion donations! lol",0

(free!)you can purchase the pro version for $20, but other than a flashlight and glider, there is nothing that pro gives you that you can't get yourself in the free version in game. the only other difference is on the free version you are limited to one world at a time (or you can play online on other people's servers). if you have pro, you can have multiple worlds and more control over the settings for them.personally. i feel that the $20 is a bit overpriced for what you get. (i get that the developers need, and deserve, to get paid.) if the pro was $10, i would say jump on it in a heartbeat. who knows, maybe it will go on sale someday!graphics: really nice.

10814,"i encourage everyone that is tired of hearthstone developer/balance/rng nonsense to try this gem. it may lack hs's flashiness (just a bit tho), but man it is deeper 100x times .tons of keywords including double attack, deadly, lifegain on hit, something happening once unit connects to face, spell protection and much more, also there is a void (where your dead or discarded cards go) and you can actually interact with it by either drawing or playing cards directly from the void if that is what your deck is about.there are no understated 'taunts' as any unit can block another one each turn, and you should actually think when to attack and when to hold, and also which unit to block to gain more advantage. there is no straight minion trading and the system favors the defender/blocker more, generally: if your unit attacked, it can't block on the next opponent's turn (unless it has special keyword), and multiple minions can block the same attacker, resulting in more favorable trade for defender. want to attack? think about it. and then think how exactly to attack, leading to...spells you can cast on your opponent's turn, that leads to more interactiveness. imagine you could kill annoying charge or whatever minion on your opponent's turn (if you saved mana(power) for the spell on your previous turn ofc). you can bait your foe to make unfavorable trades which he doesn't expect, counter spells of your choosing etc.as for the f2p side, this game is so generous it's unbelievable after playing 3 years of hs. there is single player mode where you can grind both gold and cards with just cards you get from tutorial campaign (and you build up your collection steadily and quite fast i must say). i've been playing eternal for like 60 hours now and i have almost all commons and uncommons, most rares (epics) and 18 legendaries (you can put up to four same ones in a deck), i payed in cash for just 3 packs, everything else you get just for playing the game, and the better you play, the more you get. so in 60 hours i opened over 70 packs from which only 3 were for cash. also you get crafting 'dust' just for opening the pack, and you can still dust your extras if needed.there are both solo and versus 'arenas', and you keep the cards you draft! and you can draft golden cards of any rarity too! this alone is almost worth the gold you pay, and if you win a few games, it gets even better. you get bronze, silver, gold and diamond chests for completing game activities and quests. these contain single cards (1 common in bronze, uncommon in silver, rare in gold and random golden card in diamond) plus gold (up to 2 packs worth of gold in 1 chest), and golden+diamond chests yield card packs. also there is a chance that your chest upgrades on opening (bronze can go up to diamond!), this chance is about 10-15%.card packs contain 12 cards, including 1 rare/legendary and i believe 2 or 3 uncommons. you get 1 bronze chest for every ranked win, and every third chest is silver (these all can upgrade too!) low rng element and more overall control of what you do, for example you choose which minion to resurrect from your void, what card you force your opponent to discard (yes that's a thing). the only thing you don't control is drawing right cards, which can be frustrating since you need to build up your 'mana' through cards which take 1/3 of your decks. if you starve on power early on, you can't play your cards, if you are topdecking power cards when you desperately need something else, they are literally dead draws. and that can happen many times in a row, so i guess mild bad luck protection would be sweet. playstyle variety. man, there is a lot to play with: you can buff your top units of your decks into a huge monsters and overwhelm your opponent, you can go for removal/lifegain strategy, you can play with resurrecting dead/discarded cards etc, and since there are tons of keywords and actually a great amount of cards in vanilla set (over 400), the combo potential is huge, and yes, these decks are viable, in fact, most of the powerful decks are built on sinergy and not on op 1 card bombs (yet there are surely some of these cards present, but not to an extreme degree and devs are balancing stuff atm in the beta at least)visual effects and art style are decent. don't expect blizzard level, but if you put hs art and animations at say 10/10 this would be 8.5 or maybe even 9 if they tweak some golden card animations, but they are not bad at all, just could be improved somewhere.overall i'm quite impressed, it feels like eternal took the best parts of other tcgs and blended it all in one place. this is a game many players wanted heathstone to be mechanic-wise and mtgo user/visually wise. it's complex, actually strategic, skill rewarding and extremely generous with f2p rewards: just play the game and get tons of stuff!will definitely stay and play it for a long time,9.5/10",1

13811,"let me say that right now many reviews left for this game have been due to very little experience or express sheer negativity due to what's expected to be temporary issues during the shaky steam launch. as such, the opinion of many have only scratched the surface of what a gem this game is. i'm sure the server issues and other feedback received will be put into effect soon enough.with that out of the way, onto my perspective of the game; i've been a semi-veteran player of this game for a long time and i've seen the rise and fall of dreadnought phases prior to steam. i assure that when the game is out of the current funk, it is an absolute blast. i'll say now that dreadnought is graphically a rather appealing game; the explosions, particle effects, and general environment all feel well-designed. each class of ship is unique and all are worth playing. i would say that 80% of my games i've played have had people playing all roles by desire. the progression in dreadnought is slow and steady but it feels proper; early progression playing in the recruit fleets gets you a good feel for the game and you learn a lot of stuff from your experience here as you grind out your ships to get to the next tiers. most of your time and grind will be in the veteran fleet as this provides the most diverse and immediate gameplay. you're rewarded for trying new things and whether your win or lose, it's a fun time!i will say that the integration to steam came with a few flaws outside of the current server problems; a couple of troublesome bugs are still existent in the game though they are not necessarily gamebreaking. also, the new ui is cumbersome to navigate and some of the new sounds in the game are less than stellar. some sounds that sounded great before are questionable now, but also on the flipside, some sounds lackluster before are now much better!in conclusion; before you pass on this game due to the constant reviews talking about what is mostly temporary problems, consider spending a few hours trying the game out, especially after the servers settle. if commanding a spaceship to go into battle has been one of your desires, dreadnought will not disappoint!",1

15666,"as it says, this is an early access review. in other words, the game will improve over time. if you don't wish to play the game when it's incomplete, you aren't suitable for beta testing or any testing for that matter. stay away from this currently incomplete game. (you have been warned).just like every other ae game, this has the same concept. farming. it's extremely grindy, like seriously. if you hate any form of grinding or too much grinding, then stay away as well.there are new features such as crafting and now even the pumpkin lord armour is farmable. which is a great step forward for non-p2p players. in other words, it is more farmy and less cashy. just like how an ae game should be.for anyone that complained that the pumpkinlord armour is too hard to farm due to low levels joining in the dungeon, they have capped it and is now much more easy.a new area has been released and guess what? more farming! before anyone starts complaining that the hard area is too hard, it's probably because you're too low level. (basically a newbie. not an insult here.)i take back my previous statement about levels being less important though. they are super important because the best armour currently available in game is level 15.if you're new to ae games, i really don't recommend this because the story does not flow. yes. ae games are made in such a way that if you never played any other games made by them, the story will feel very weird and rushed. as a long time player of all their games, i can say that their lore is extremely deep. for example, the plot twist about artix and gravelyn actually makes sense. if you looked back at their past storyline, you'll actually see why. sepulchure's backstory is personally my favourite (and the way he died t^t)basically, if you want to start on this game, play all of its prequels.if you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how ae games work, you will have a 50% chance of either loving it, or hating it.",1

10752,"this game is what hearthstone & magic the gathering would be if they had a baby. the tutorial is a bit long, but totally worth it because you get 9 free precreated decks. you can win easily in this game than you can in hearthstone or magic tg. it may be early access, but is still fun any how. i haven't noticed ang bugs in this game yet. some people reviewed that you have to log in every time you play. that is not the case with me. i only have to create a user name and password once and verify my email was mine. hearthstone i stopped playing because it relied on rng to win. this game takes skill and patience to create a deck that works for you. another problem people have with this game is 1/3 of your cards have to be power cards called sigils in this game. they say it's not good for them because they draw sigils when they want a playable card. in this game you have units, spells, attachments & sigels. i got to say this: this game is addicting & i don't mind investing my money in the game when i can afford it. you get 10 cards in a pack of cards with at least 1 of them being a rare or better card. in this game there are common, uncommon, rare, promo, and legenday cards. gold is easier to make in this game than hearthstone. and sometimes you get multiple rewards for completing them like gold, individual cards and even card packs, & also dust which you use to create cards you don'r own in yhis game. you can view cardss by rarity, card type, or any combination you want. you can have 4 of the same cards or special sigils (which usely gives you sigils from your deck or 2 different sigils for the price of 1) in your decks unless their specific sigils which take up 1/3 of your deck. there are 2 currencies in this game gold & diamonds. gold you earn by copleting quests or winning a match. diamonds i think you have to buy with real money, but i am okay with that because i am investing money in a game that i think is better than hearthstone or magic tg & i think it aids in the development of the game. i haven't found a limit to the number of decks you can have yet & i have over 30. some i made & some i bought. and each sigil type has a level up system which i haven't found out what leveling up does. cards in the game stay the same no matter what level you are, but you gain rewards & achievements for reaching certain levels. there is a lot to this game that keeps it interesting and addicting some of which you can do for free. you can have as many casual or ranked matches you want, you don't stop getting rewards when you reach a certain limits either. i hope this review encourages others to play it too. i hope others enjoy it as much as i do. i can recommend this game to newbies or veterans.",1

11503,"i have played almost every single major online fps that has been released in the last 20 years and the hours i have put into this game are enough for me to know that it is absolutely one of the best i have played. for me it is a perfect mix of counter strike and call of duty (apart from the fact it uses counter strikes moving while firing mechanics - there is absolutely no jumpshotting or firing snipers while moving in this game, and its best to stay pretty still in general which i hate in video games, but each to their own).mechanically this game is sound, i like the map designs and i like the objectives (tdm, cs type objectives, and a domination type mode where each team has to protect their 5 bases from being destroyed by enemy gunfire, explosives, and usually, knives). i like the weapons and i've never seen a game where preference is so subjective. in call of duty i did tend to stick to certain guns but hand me any ar and it'll do the same job as any other. this game has wildly different guns so it's fun to experience different ones and find out what works for you, you don't really want to google best guns as each person will definitely have different tastes. these are the bulk of the microtransactions, but it's a really solid f2p experience and absolutely not p2w at all. i got the most powerful sniper in the game on my first day without making a purchase and bought an ak47 and a few other guns within a few hours of gameplay, and have also accrued a few loaned guns which expire after a few days of redeeming them (you can store them in your inbox for 30 days before redeeming), but i might not even use them as guns are obtained very reasonably. netcode is absolutely incredible and i haven't ever felt like i should have got that hit/kill unless it was down to my own failures, absolutely top marks in that regard.my one huge gripe with this game, however, is down to the community. people never ever communicate but on the off chance they do it's probably to call someone the n word (although i haven't played the hostage/snd game modes too much). unfortunately i'm not exaggerating at all, in my hours of gameplay so far, not a single player has taken my advice from enemy locations or objective instructions. players mostly use knives on objectives so they are absolutely sitting ducks ripe for the picking, but no one will ever go and get that easy kill if you tell them there is an enemy knifing an objective. ever.i have not seen a single positive thing come from the community except the occasional gl hf which is usually followed by a go f_ your mom n_ f_ or something along those lines. you need to play with friends if you want any chance of your teammates being responsive, especially as this game is full of f2p noobs.that being said, if you have a good group of friends to play with, you'll probably stomp every single game and never actually lose.amazing game, let down slightly by an atrocious community. if you're american it might not be so bad as it may just be the language barrier of european servers as well as the type of people that play f2p games here.",1

9137,"insanely awesome. those are the best two words that describe this game. no other shooter perfectly captures the epic sci-fi battles that take place as three massive armies clash for territory. when you walk into a battle, you don't just see people pointing, shooting and killing. you've got several heavy assaults laying down suppressive fire while the medics are running around, dodging bullets and fearlessly jumping into the heart of battle to save their fallen comrades. then a platoon of tanks comes rolling in, cannons blazing, followed by a galaxy dropping more troops while the gunners cover and fighters duking it out for air supremacy in the skies above, dodging the relentless aa fire.and that's just a little bit of the everyday battle for territory. it's also my favorite part about this game: the intense cinematic battles and sights that no other shooter replicates quite as well.the only downsides i can think of is this game lags any computer like crazy, even my really high-end pc. also, there is a little too much pay-to-win present.9.5/10",1

12208,"i am going to ignore all the technical issues with the game for this review for those things could be fixed.the combat in bless is garbage for lack of a better term. it was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is. there are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion...yet there is no such fun mobile movement in bless. there's no dodge, there's no blocking, no teleporting, nothing, you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion. (the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of 35 seconds!) beyond the combat: bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. you kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. so, bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. also, as i'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. people in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different mmo in a language you don't understand. gear: initially (for the first 30 levels, as far as i was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) easily the worst mmo i've ever played. most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend 40 dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.",0

1103,"so far i have really enjoyed playing this game, particularily the larger ships like the leviathon and destroyer. definately recommend this game to anyone who likes space. i do think there needs to be some changes to hp for some ships, especially the cloaked ships and sniper. a ship that has devestating alpha, can cloak, has decent speed, and 2000 more base hp than the fast ships that would be hunting them seems slightly unbalanced to me. don't get me wrong, i love playing them but they are just don't have enough weaknesses for the role they are filling. sniper ship also needs less hp and its guns should have slower movement(not too much slower but a sniper shouldnt be able to follow a frigate 5km away(and to the side) and hit every time. think a tank destroyer in world of tanks vs a fast medium or light. they can hit but it's much harder. i think the carrier damage rating should be reduced 1 point as well. it really is more of a support/defensive ship and even in close range with max upgrades(vs a max upgrade opponent) it doesnt seem to match the offensive output indicated by its rating. just to be clear, i think the damage is fine(but i wouldn't complain if there were a few more bombers per wing) but that it doesn't seem to meet the current offensive rating from what i've found. these current specs are not game breaking by any means and pilot skill usually always wins but i do feel these are relatively easy fixes that would help game balance.",1

(pay to get much better cards that can flat you out like truck hitting a bug)it's fun and gameplay really based on your own style. however, in order to win, you need to have the best cards, at least much better than your opponent. so basically to obtain these cards manually is to use your own money or obtainable hardly thru in-game diamond currency (obtainable). it seems very unfair when someone has 1 or 2 better card than you, easily destroys well planned strategy just because they have that one card no one has obtained. point is you need very good card in order to win another player. your basic or normal cards wont do. but the thing is you can get those cards by pouring as much money as you want to obtain fast and easy cards, then you can win against other players who have less good cards than yours.in a word: its a bit pay to win if you play for competitive mode (against real players) but if you play casually, for fun or nostalgic visits, this game might be good. warning : there's a difference when fighting versus npc and player. there will be a huge gap. fighing npc is like fighting a toddler who knows nothing and very straightforward. whereas fighting real player is like you fighting a world championship ufc fighter where they use combos to beat you down and you cant doabout it, and because your gloves are made of cotton and his are made of spiky steel and will beat you down and you will be stunned all the way.",0

3054,"product received for freeedit, 22 nov 2018: wow. just... wow. if you're here for ship-to-ship combat, i gotta say that wows does it better. sorry, but it's true.edit, 27 may 2018: i have almost 1200 hours in-game?! why do i keep doing this to myselfedit: with about 850 hours played at the time of this edit, clearly i am not paying attention to my own negative recommendation. i do enjoy the game, and recommend it to anyone playing wot as the next step in tank combat games. wot feels pre-pubescent in comparison. if you want air combat or to blast people with tanks, or both, try this out. many things have changed in war thunder since i began, good and bad, but i keep coming back. the gui is still garbage, but i know how it works now. i'm going to keep my recommendation negative, because wt is very hard for new players to get into.::: what follows was my first impression after about 4 hours of play ::: yay, planes. yay, tanks.boo, matchmaking balance. boo, one of the most unintuitive gui's i've ever seen.it's fun the first few matches. the matchmaking system is merciful, and takes pity on the noobs. suddenly, once you get a plane that happens to not be a biplane, regardless of whether you select a biplane to begin with, matchmaker decides that you are an elite ace pilot, and makes sure to never disappoint you by giving you any match that's too easy. or fair.i can't for the life of me figure out this interface, either. if i want to do something like change a crew from plane 1 to plane 2, i apparently need to go buy some sort of manual for the game. coming from certain other free games of this variety, i just cannot tell what they were thinking when they designed this thing.if i want to play in a match full of biplanes it seems i must send any higher tier planes on holiday and then go into the match so i don't get placed in a game with jet fighters by accident. problem? if i mysteriously decide i'd like to fly a higher tier plane i've sent on holiday, i must do some sort of 're-purchase' of the crew, as if they'd all died in a barracks fire or perhaps choked to death on their bloody tea and crumpets while i was out. can i decide which crew goes to which plane? seems not.i like the gameplay. i absolutely abhor the gui. matchmaking needs help.enter at your own risk. godspeed.edit: after over 200 hours, i'm still learning new things about this gui. stockholm syndrome has set in. i see the reasons they've done things in particular ways, but there's still a ton of room for improvement.i still can't really recommend the game unless you're at least mildly masochistic. come, join me in the darkness, but don't say i didn't warn you.",0

6768,"this game is amazing. it's totally awesome. the gameplay is sensational. i really enjoyed it. the ui was a little clunky but okay, i could deal with it. it's a fantastic game. however.. the in-game currency system is a sham. you have to pay for everything. every single little thing you want to change about your character or even keep playing, you have to pay. it's such a shameless method of the developers forcing you to keep playing the game more! what's worse? if you choose a new career path after spending ages getting to rank 5, you have to pay to change. this limits all your character options back to lv.1 again. so you start from scratch, again. you also can't use certain weapons. so what if you wanna swap back to the career you've already unlocked?... you have to pay again!! i've wasted 100,000 finding that out! you only get about 7,000 per game!! i am constantly taxed on every piece of this game. i olve playing it, but this is well enough to force me to stop. let us play the f-ing game!!! i don't mind paying for things, but it's far too expensive and they should stay unlocked. unbelivable. ruined a great game.",0

6501,to be fair the game has a good concept and i just love the little unbalace in this game.for example the german tiger is stronger then the russian and american versions.but the fun thing is all 3 faction have their strenght en cons that makes it very enjoyable.this has decreased a bit since the steam launch though but the cons and pro's still exist.this game however is very grindy and that can be anoying or a blessing the devs keep adding new stuff so if your really like the game you have allways a goal to strive for but that can take some time.you can easily invest hundreds of hours into this game this way.also the game is slightly pay to win for example the veteran bonus (a subsribtion around 20-30 bucks for 3 months) that you will get gives you a extra credits gain extra experience extra warfunds game a 4th equipment slot and a second ribbon slot. the last one is most significant when it comes to gameplay because's each ribbon gives a quite nice boost to your character and the ability to equip 2 can make some weapon ribbon combinations 10-20% better in terms of k-dheroes and generals is still a little buggy and in my opinion are not all changes to the lenght of the grind have been apriciative but it has a quite unique gameplay style and i have just spoken about the heroes side of the game.as the devs in hng saysee you on the battlefield,1

4038,"tf2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. on its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, tf2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest. balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. however, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. it's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.the primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. with a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as tf2 won't do it for you.tf2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. with a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. on top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money. it has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. what tf2 offers is a rich fps experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. so i have no issues recommending this game to any fps fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.",1

14440,"do not get this game. wow!it has only gotten worse and worse. back in 2014 everything was fantastic! we had a cool tech tree that inspired all players to keep playing, building, battling, and creating. there use to be a bunch of good game mechanics and the play was addicting and would keep you satisfied foralmost every battle. since then, a lot has changed. everyone was excited when we heard we would get new weapons and better parts, but there were some changes to how much rp (robo points) you could get from winning. the changes kept coming, with each update going one step forward and three steps back. back in the good days, there were various tiers of blocks, with the higher tier blocks having more health than the previous tier. those had good things and bad things, but for the most part they were good. (each tier of block would be a different color, essentially meaning the paint that we have now was all free and you didn't have to buy premium to get cool colors.) the update back in the winter of 2015 changed a lot. with the various block tiers gone, the millions of rp that i had spent on strong&healthy blocks had all gone to wast, with no refund! i could also get into the ranking system. it used to be great, allowing for higher tier items to go into lower tiers, wich allowed for more fun. even though it may sound unfair it would not be an effective strategy for actuall combat. this system worked well and rank was built around each weapon having a different robo score. but as with all good things in robocraft, that was removed. and instead, it was replaced by a system that still had tiers, but wasn't as fun. adding restrictions to a creative game is just something that doesn't ever work out too well. eventually the tier system was abolished and replaced with a system that puts you in a match with robots that have a similar overall robot level. that was nothing compared to what it has turned into now. now, the tech tree idea has been trashed and instead replaced by a rarety system with crates. this new update completely killed robocraft. (as if the other updates hadn't done enough damage already) the game is no longer based around skill or experience, it is pure luck. you used to be able to get new items by buying them off the shop with the rp you had earned by battling, (the better you did the more you earned) but now, the only way you will be able to get your hands on that nice plasma cannon is by opening a crate and praying that you get it. and as others have said, the current game, as it stands, is purely luck based.well freejam ill give it to you, you sure do know how to ruine a great game!tl;drthe game now suckspoint system has gone tobr>no longer an insentive to playall luck, no skilldon't waste your time on this gameused to be fantastic game butdevs killed it this just shows how much the devs don't care. fact!all the cool building they are doing in the trailer/video are with the old version, when it didn't suck as bad!",0

14832,"wall of text inbound:great game. amazing game. i love this game to pieces. at least i used to. the game was awesome up until recently. than crates arrived. actually i shouldn't blame one update i suppose. if i were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, i'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf. this feature, which i'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. the crf allowed for the rapid deployment of op bots or rather exploitative builds. i'm going to use the tesseract as an example. while not a huge issue on its own, it is the way freejam went about resolving this issue that made matters worse. to any veteran of the game that had some knowledge of the problem, the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. a more complex fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. sadly, freejam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1,but 3 (now 2, but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. while the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. this isn't a review whining about badly balanced aa though, so onto the next nail. shortly after this fiasco, fj introduced epic loot. a system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins 9 times out of 10. instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to test their luck with crates. crates that logically fail to reward a player. common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. this makes sense. the crates fj has forced upon us do not follow such logic. high tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. this is ing stupid, period. there's also the complaint regarding the premium row flaunting items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. moving on to the big one. a lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. if every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. as simple as this problem is, it is so bad in fj's case. the simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customers to vent. why? no devs will respond, with exception of drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :3). the devs that have a proper power over the games development use twitter instead of their own forums. it's dumb. anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, i'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. so tl;dr:pros:1. builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. 2. not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. cons:1. devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised 2. balance weapons? what are those? 3. exploit/meta builds everywhere. creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to fj. 4. hope you enjoy gambling. ===i really like this game. but sadly, i can't recommend it to anyone because for 1. you're not rewarded for and the devs don't seem to intent on fixing the issues.",0

3656,"currently the game is awful. it lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. quickplay is gone. it's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called casual. it's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. dosn't help that the queue times are god awful as well. i managed to watch 3 entire sgbplay mario party videos, which are about 1:30 hours long each, before entering a single match of badwater that lasted about 10 minutes. and in those 10 minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of morgan freeman, or the team hoovy/spycrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. hell, even the lenny/bind spammers are gone. this simple move has taken all the character and charm tf2 had andall over it.next is the balancing. this game has horrible balancing. especially since valve doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. only listening to the competitive players. people like b4nny and mr.slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by valve, and to what has that opinion led? phlog buff of smissmass 2015 and caber nerf of summer 2015. two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the phlog became the walk and die weapon of the century. this update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. come on, who was complaining about the buffalo steak sandvich!? who complained enough to say it needed a nerf!? next is the communication. valve communicating with the community, what a pipedream. they never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. at most we get the ocassional neato in the sub-reddit. and why you might ask? because the tf team is 5 people who don't care/give aabout their own game. overwatch was released, one would expect valve to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with heavy vs pyro, which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. if valve simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. most of the tf community would be happy knowing that valve didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. and finally, my biggest gripe with tf2 currently, it's more personal and i know i'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of mac support. i run tf2 on mac, which some might call , but at least i run tf2 at 230 fps. well would run it. the game is in such a state where the mac support died off about 3 months ago. the game constantly crashes with the error out of memory or because the game failed to load a single texture. not to mention the game loads textures one at a time. for mac users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. so for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to 3 hours on 2fort alone. also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the retriving server info part of the loading screen. i'm not sure if windows/linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the mac to crash in some way or another. there's even been instances where my entire computer, not just tf2, but all of it crashed due to tf2 failing to load me in. the last true patch mac ever got was about 1 year ago in gun mettle, where valve did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? this is a tf2 only issue, gmod runs fine, cs:go runs fine, but tf2 doesn't. the game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. doesn't even feel valve is the one making the game anymore. it feels like ea or god-fobid ubisoft took the wheel with this game.",0

6914,"as a huge fan of the elder scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me! it's really personal preference whether you play this, magic or hearthsone etc but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double laning system in esl. the story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and they're many different ways to test out new decks created, vs ai or actual players. there is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too, and also there is a nice addition of solo arena which pits you versing tough ai characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose 3 times. each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards. the deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation. overall this would be my favorite card game in its current genre. 8/10",1

7506,"what has happened to the game i once knew and loved?me and my best friend were searching for some games to play, we got bored of tf2 and found trove. at the time you had to download the glyph client in order to play, but we didn't mind. we played a lot, had so much fun and i had that much fun that i got ahead of my best friend by a lot. then shadow towers got introduced to the game and it was fun to battle to titan bosses. i would always be one of the last players standing with my end-game dracolyte.then it all changed, the game i once knew and loved vanished. it became a grinding game where the p2w players would most of the time have the upper hand. classes became pay to get, and their reason was to make players feel different from others, it pretty much didn't change anything. i wouldn't have minded, but the developers are the most laziest. the servers are most of the items are community created right now, they keep on doing the same events, do some quests, get a reward that isn't worth it, and the amount you had to farm for it was just dumb. i have around 1000 hours experience and i can say that i wish they could just revert back to the beta. and the new players think they are so smart, saying t like the game is not p2w, it is not bad and keep on arguing. if they were here in the beta they would have known why we even starter an argument about thethe game is.seriously, trion world, if you wish to become a better company, you can start by fixing theload of bugs you have, some that are still here and have since the beta. and get rid of most of the p2w",0

1224,the game has some issues when it has a glitch that prevents hyperspace when the game starts and requires a rejoin as well as some ping issues when other game pings run better than others possibly lack of many servers but besides that it runs smoothly even if its at a low fps you can see everything going on and the graphics are amazing as well as attention to detail. one thing i look forward to seeing in this game is more ship damage like an ablity to ram a ship in a weak point and tearing it in two. i look forward to continuing to support and play the game and its potential for the future!,1

7968,"enjoyable in short bursts for a long time, i stopped playing nw because it was an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic werent all that interested in fixing it. ive returned after more than six months to nw and i gotta say its a pretty fun f2p mmo, taken in small doses. the combat is fast paced and satisfying, plus after a longtime the game is finally optimized and you can properly enjoy it (it should run at 50-60fps on most pcs even in more crowded areas).although its based on the forgotten realms d&d setting, this game is nothing like its tabletop counterpart (or neverwinter nights for that matter). nw is an action mmo through and through, your characters have no alignment to speak of, so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world (except for the fact that some races work better for some classes). the voice acting is decent, the music is pretty good, graphics are acceptable (better than most f2p mmos on the market), just dont go into this game expecting the next big thing.if you are not willing to spend any money on this game, then i would suggest you stay away from pvp. as a non-paying player you wont be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop items that make your life much easier (or those who have played aton). as a side note, you are able to convert astral diamonds (a currency you get from different in-game activities) into zen (the premium currency, that can also be bought with your hard earned $) to buy stuff from the cash shop, but the rates arent all that great.another problem for free players is that we are limited to 2 character slots per account, which is kinda  and the only way to get more is with zen (on the other hand, you can make and use as many free accounts as you like). whats more, 3 races are locked behind game packs that go for 49,99  for the moon elf, 69,99  for the dragonborn and 189,99  for the menzoberranzan renegade (the packs also include some mounts, a char slot each and some otherthats not all that useful).as for pve, its pretty entertaining, albeit repetitive. once you hit max lvl, your main goals are to obtain some artifacts and do the campaigns (which mostly consist of doing daily quests, getting some resources which youll use to research some passive skills for your character). the quests you do arent all that memorable, but at least they arent very long, so you wont have to spend too much time with em. recently theyve also introduced a system that makes the campaigns faster for an alt but i havent spent much time with it so i cant say how much faster they really are.all in all, if you can look past its flaws (which are quite a few), nw is a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly killing monsters and grinding some gear.",1

8056,"like this game a lot, it's fairly easy to learn and the animations are really nice. graphics are also great, but i tone mine down some due to lag. when there's over 30 players in an area it can get really bad. thankfully there's the option to move to another channel with less players.the fighting is both mouse and select keys, but you can customize your set up so those that wish to can. there's an auction house, there's dungeons and you can upgrade your gear and give your companions upgrades too. there are events that offer extra bonuses and something to do besides quests, dungeons and pvp areas.there are new expansions and new race or even new class options, currently there is a new expansion coming soon. there is a new class that will be coming soon. not sure if there's room for another race at the moment, but one never knows.customizing a character avatar is really nice and there's even an area under history where you can enter a bio about the character. there's a bank and email system, mounts and there's even player created dungeons/instances that you can play. after a certain level, you can even try a go at making your own.this game offers a lot of ways to play and things to do. i think it's well worth it for a free 2 play game. yes there is a store, but it isn't required to buy anything to have fun playing.",1

7250,"i usually dont play online card games because, in my opinion, card games like this seem to typically be based more on luck instead of skill, which i dont like, i also typically dont play online card games because a decent amount seem to be pay to win *cough* cough* hearthstone *cough* *cough* and sadly, this game seems to already be going down a pay to win path, its not as pay to win however, seeing as how getting money for card packs seems to be a lot easier than it is in hearthstone, but i am still somewhat dissapointed that despite the fact that this game is only about a month old, there are technically 2 dlc's, the dark brotherhood cards and the heroes of skyrim dlc, the game gave me the alduin heroes of skyrim deck for free (i dont know why) and i played with it a bit, and the heroes of skyrim cards absolutely destroy core cards, which kinda upset me, i just hope it doesnt get to the point where everyone just uses skyrim cards just to avoid being crushed by other people with skyrim cards, because most of the core cards are very good, but only against other core cards, the only thing i can say i fully enjoyed from this game was the story, the story is difficult, but not too difficult, which i loved, and the rewards you get for playing it are amazing, overall, i have to say i dislike this game, but if you are a person who thinks they could get into it, i highy reccomend playing the campaign fully for all the nice bonuses, and also, dont spend your gold on core cards, but skyrim card packs with it, so you dont get crushed.",0

14812,"came back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that i no longer endorse this game. they had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (tl;dr alert) i've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why i don't play anymore. i used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. the removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. all of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. shooting said weak spots and watching 75% of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. it was the highlight of the game. the second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.how did this change? the removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. this absolutely destroyed the enjoyment of the game for me. i regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below 15% health, and this was due to having 3 working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. the poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy 75% of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. it used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. i got destroyed all the time when i first started playing, but i did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about 6 kills per game (no respawns when i played)i honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but i hate when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche. rip robocraft.",0

12585,"because of assetto corsa, i was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so i thought i'd try it out. it turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. it's essentially the real racing 3 of computers, except real racing 3 allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent.let's talk about the game itself. the physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, real racing 3 looks much better. especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best.is it a bad game? not necessarily, i'm guessing the game is merely developing, but i feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. definitely get assetto corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, i'd recommend trackmania nations forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of grid 2, which has online multiplayer.",0

6343,"don't care about the playing time. i usually launch non-steam version excepting payment.this review is written in japanese and english. sorry about my poor english. fpsall what i'd like to say is us weapons of fresh soldiers are stronger than german ones in this game. of course, german weapon can be strong in the end. german players must be patient. until your trooper trained enough, you will be killed so many times even if you are experienced in first-person shooter. don't worry about the kill-death ratio. in this game, tankers usually make 30kill-0death score or more. anyway, if you want to play on axis side, please remember these disadvantages as follows.g43m1mp3420m3m1lv upmp40(mg3438t)m1first, us infantry equipments are superior than german's ones. the damage and recoil of g43 rifle(german beginning rifle) are inferior than m1 garand(american). if you want to keep using this rifle for long time, you should improve these status by installing weapon mods. after that, this rifle will be able to defeat uncle sam with only twice body-hits in close to middle range. mp34 submachine gun has only 20 rounds while m3 greese gun has 30 rounds. this gap suffer german players. of course, you can purchase mp40 submachine gun when you earn enough exps of smg ribbon.however, its fire power and rate of fire is still worse than m1 thompson. in addition, the biggest problem is ... mp40 is so expensive. its price is higher than mg34 and even light tanks !!ww21()m24m5apcrm2a212.7mm7.92mm38t2m26secondly, the difference of the quality of tanks is serious. excepting russian, most people may believe german tanks are best in ww 2 !!. although it might be true, in this game, german tank soldiers must walk thorny path. pz.i light tank(german beginning tank) is the worst tank, and it will be just a coffin in tank battle.this tank bring only a pair of 7.92mm machine gun while american m2a2 lt has 12.7mm machine gun. for example, however when you shoot apcr(better penetration and more expensive ammo) against the back armor of m5 stuart or m24 chaffee, it can never penetrate(shoot out) their armor, even they are light tanks!! in case, against m4 sherman or m26 persing? needless to answer... so, if you want to train german tanker, i recommand you to avoid tank battle with pz.i. attack only enemy infantry and non-armored vehicles, and gain exps of light tank ribbon to buy 38t tank. it is the best light tank in german, and it can kill american light tank from its front. german heavy tanks are actually good, but there are only a few opportunity to cast them in standard battle.1skirmishlike this, german player will fight under disadvantages. but, after getting well-trained soldier and purchase enough weapons, you will feel this game fun. while you are new player, you should join only skirmish battle, and earn exps and credits. skirmish mode battle takes less time thans assault mode battle.1m183red orchestra231finally, i need to tell an important thing to both us and german new players. the fresh soldier has no anti-tank weapons, and they cannot buy them yet. your anti-human grenades cause quite no damage against armor targets. it means, you can easily be slaughtered by even pz.i light tank!! and, compared with red orchestra series, the damage of anti-tank weapons is weaker and weaker. for exapmle. you will need 3 direct hit of panzerfaust to kill m18 hellcat(even this tank-destroyer has only 13~25mm of armor). if you use anti-tank grenade(this is so risky), it also needs twice or more. using panzerschreck or m1a1 bazooka is more damage than panzeraust, and much safer than anti-tank grenade. but their prices are so expensive. after consuming all 50 rounds, you need to supply them at the same prices of buying new ones. as the result, when you get suffered by enemy tanks and you want to eliminate them, you should cast a tank, like enemy does.",1
885,"the takeaway: fractured space has qutie a lot of good potential. the graphics are great thanks to the ut4 engine. the gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing moba archetypes. i felt that there's enough promise to put my $15 usd on the table after playing just a few matches. it's like homeworld, world of tanks, and lol/dota/hots had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.the good: amazing graphics for a moba title fresh gameplay for the genre intuitive, easy to master controls unique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don't care, but for me that's a huge thing) the bad: horrible lag issues. (i'm used to some lag, but i've had a few matches where i would jump large distances from where i was or where i intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites. no tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. there needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (move next to the point to capture and so on. something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). i've managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn't readily apparent even after reading the in-game how to play primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an mtg card. there's nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn't know you could upgrate your ship's systems you'll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship. however there is one big caveat i'll give to my little bit of whining above. i didn't bother to read any of the how to play stuff outside of the control scheme for my first 3 matches.",1
15129,the current state of the game is ed.this was in the start really promising. i really liked the game and would have given it a positive review back then. now you can't even get access to most of the stuff in the game because of the loot crates. i can't even choose what stuff i get in a game where the player is supposed to design the vehicle. not their luck. now people who don't pay the developers have to get rekt by chainguns.,0

13312,"as someone who always needs an idea, and never knows how to get started when i do get one, i'm a fan of the blueprint system in this game. i like the challenge of gathering the materials for the build, and the customizability of the blocks in the blueprint doesn't limit my creativity. the abundace of recipes and blocks make it so you won't grow easily bored. when you're working on a build, or focused on terraforming the perfect spot for a build, it's really easy to get sucked into the game. personally, i have a tendency to wander, so the map and touchstone/teleporters are great for when i (lacking any sense of direction) inevitably get lost. i've scattered projects across many biomes and i still haven't fully discovered the world in which i'm currently playing. creativerse is a great game to play alone or (if you've got 'em) with friends. i started this game while it was in its early access stages and it's been great to see how much it's grown since then. that said, however, i do wish they would add more content to bring my friends back into the game, as i know they don't like that there's not much to do or see in the game lately. there's a lot more they could do with it and i hope to see it soon!",1

1394,from what i have played (which isn't very much but enough to justify this review) the game overall is pretty solid. moba style game and map with 2 lanes and a center lane for a buff that spawn randomly. it's fun both alone and with friends. the only bad thing about this game i find is the ui can take some time to get your head around espcially the main menu which just has buttons and doohickeys everywhere.

13159,"i started playing this because i was under the mistaken assumption it provided unlocks in fallout 4. it does not, if you have the same misconception.so, why the negative review? and the answer is that the game uses tedium and enforced grinding as a gameplay mechanic, and it doesn't have to.the game concept itself is novel enough, and if you like the fallout universe, it's pretty cute. it's simple, but it was meant for mobile devices, so that makes sense. build a vault, manage your settlers, fight baddies for loot, rinse, wash and repeat. all of that is just well and dandy.the problem arises from the fact that there's basically no ai, and everything is agonizingly manual. resources got produced? gather those suckers manually. loot got found? gather that stuff manually. danger at the vault? manually tell people to go help. and then go to the next room when the danger spreads, rather than remember why they were sent. ready to give birth? not until the overseer delivers your kid themself. it goes on and on.it's micromanagement without depth, which means that it's just a chore, at the end of the day. well, that and waiting. the combat system is 95% waiting, and not whilst the app/game is closed; sit there, and watch healthbars slowly fall, hoping you'll get a crit and somethingf to do.and then they hit you with the paid content to make things quicker, easier, and more automated. you literally pay to play less, and be bothered less. nothing against paid content, they have a right to make money from their work. but paid content should give you more of the game, not less of the annoyance. top tier weapons? just less waiting in combat. you can bypass the whole process by not playing it at all.",0
8984,"ps2 is a great game, and i highly recommend it, if you've got a strong enough pc to play it smoothly. been playing on and off for the past couple of years, not on steam (i had 389 hours in on the miller european server before i switched to the u.s. west coast server, for a grand total of 418 as of this writing).a big thing for me is that the player base tends to be considerably more decent than that of a lot of other competitive shooter-type mmos i've played. and dbg seems to be really on top of hackers and cheaters lately. they tend to announce in-game when they've booted a cheater; i recently saw a broadcast message to all players a few sessions ago that ding dang dong has been bing bang banned for cheating. i guess the guy's name was that, or something like that, and the admin online was feeling frisky. got a kick out of that. anyway.but, of course, the real kick of the game is the massive battles involving 100-150 players, with bombers and fighters sparring overhead as the tanks and sundies (troop transports/mobile spawn points) roll across the battlefield amid the blips of players on foot. it really accomplishes something there, and the feel is great.as with any free-to-play game, progression is painfully slow if you don't spend *some* money on the game to get a few important goodies, like a heavy pistol, anti-aircraft guns for your max and light tank, and some heavier weaponry for your heavy tank, but the beginning weapons are noted as being competitive. in all honesty, i really don't know if i'd continue to enjoy the game nearly as much if i'd never spent a cent on it (and i've been pretty cheap -- we're on a tight budget, so i've spent $30 total on it), but i suppose it's a matter of patience.i can say, though, that if you can, the game is worth the money you'll spend on it.unless you're on a core 2 duo or something. in that case, just... no. you're going to be very frustrated with this. i am not sure -- i think they have optimized it better, but it is still very heavy-feeling, at least on our 4gb core 2 duo clunker.those caveats aside, it's a great game, and i highly recommend it.",1
6309,"product received for freeearly access reviewthis game, has potential. this can be a fun game. and i hope, that this game is fun when it is finished. but, the beta lacks balance. in the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. that is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. some may say,oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon. i would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. the first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. to hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then. i haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. most of the maps, i've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. only five to be exact. however, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective. the lack of progress is irratating. because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. after about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. you then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. plus, the first american smg is significantly better than the german counterpart because of its lack of recoil. after almost twelve hours pf gameplay, i still can't afford the smg, i'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and i'm frankly at wits end. i will say that at first it was fun, but now i find myself getting annoyed. i am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like i haven't made any progress. i think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. if you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. but their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.",0
7331,"an interesting game. fun for a while before you realize that this game is just too luck based and not enough skill based. for example, one of the story based missions requires you to keep from having a single card destroyed. it takes quite a few rounds to get the luck required to have the right cards in your hand at the right time. for a 2nd mission story to have to be repeated 20+ times till you are lucky enough is just plain frustrating. there is a huge variety of cards to play through and the game has awesome mechanics. when the right cards are in your hand, the game is very fun when playing against other players, but at a minimum of 50 cards, it will take a while to figure out how to build a deck. for card based game players, i would reccomend you to give it a chance. for me, though, i cant stand working on a single story mission over and over and over...you get the idea.",1
14978,"look i would love to give this game a positive review but i can't. it can be fun sometimes but most of the time your team gets whooped by the enemy team cause they spent more money on crates, and nobody ever comunicates! you will get a 1/1000 chance of getting one other person who will actually speak more thanthis team sucks im better than all of you plus this game is super pay to win. if you dont get premium, say goodbye to most customization options and half of the loot you earn. im not joking without premium, you only get half of the loot crate contents. woah you got a legendary? well first you gotta pay premium for that. also good luck getting the parts you need because everything you can sell for in game credits, is only worth about 1/5 of how much in game credits it costs to buy the same thing you are selling. for example: ghoast module is a legendary item. you get it in the in game block store for roughly 150,000 in game credits. you can only sell it for about 30,000 in game credits. why? there is so much more i want to say but i can't rant for too long so this is all but i have some advice: instead of making a free game where over half the content is locked behind a pay wall which, you should know to get permanent premium costs about 50-100$, you should just make your game cost money instead! make the game 10, 20, heck maybe even 50$ if your that greedy, but dont lock over half of the actuall game behind a pay wall.",0

14493,"really want free jam to read this and new players to understand that i am speaking from a veteran's pov. this isn't meant to be a harsh. i want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the 3rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. i can't recommend this game yet but i do encourage people to try it. robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before i can safely recommend it (i really enjoy the game, i want to emphasize that... i also want to emphasize that with each update, i have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). i want to give an overview of how i feel about robocraft and i will try to give an effective outline of what i want to say. this isn't me defending or bashing the game. this review is meant to be fair.i want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how i feel about it. i want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. i want to briefly mention the factory. i want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). i want to talk about some issues i have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical it sucks or i love crushing noobs or i get crushed by every meta/ pro user) and offer a solution. i want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. i want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. i want to talk about robocraft's community (there is might be some salt in here. be warned). finally, i will finalize with the largest problem i see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (if this is resolved, then i think it will help the game as a whole).the current movement system is very player friendly. you can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. i am not even joking. i made a ugandan knuckles fly. you can make tanks as well via tank treads. mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ 3rd person point of view games. camera controls are set as default to help people out. keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). i don't advise them in tier 5. heli-copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very overpowered. currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. my solution is that hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. insect legs are very bad. they don't do as their were originally intended to do. when i use them, even when i don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. they don't cling to ceilings. as a solution, i made 2 insect bots that do these things but i had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (if interested, look up block widdow or the hanger in the factory, use keyboard controls). the hanger demonstrates perfectly what i want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. the block widdow demonstrates what i want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like the hanger is able to do. if insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. the current weapon balance in tier 5 is... terrifying. the mega plasma (with the help of the trusty power module) can completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. the rail impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a rapid fire precision based weapon. the mega smg gun, well, its fine. the flak cannon is seriously weak. the loml deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. the mortar got nerfed hard, which i don't know how i feel about that since i started maining it until it got nerfed. the shotgun (ion distorter) feels useless. until weapons are balanced in way that is satisfying to free jam (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. i feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. i am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (i consider block spam as the control group in this position). p. s. t0 smgs need an increased fire rate.the factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. the factory made a war between fighters and builders. the fighters obviously win. i see far less builders than i do fighters in tier 5. the same goes to t1. i don't think there should be t1/t2 bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. i have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.in regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, i feel like they are too small. the old maps from the beginning, were really cool but i think free jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. i think there needs ro be more maps. more maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.in regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but i think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. when this game gets its player base up again, have a league mode where all teirs are meshed together. keep the current tier system the same. in regards to custom games, i think there should be a public/ private settings on it. i mean like allow people to random join. people will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. the matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. for when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.the community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. this will turn off new players to this game. i don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. when free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. free jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of the game is dead. other than that, the community is cool. lots of people are willing to help out. also, new players shouldn't be able to get access to t5 parts so easily.now to get to the root problem that plagues free jam. the main center of conflict that free jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. solutions? well i think if free jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. for content ideas, i would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. i would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. thank you for your time. i encourage free jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. again i can't recommend this game yet but i encourage people to try this game and share their views on it and to share ideas.",1

2812,"i have sunk over at least a hundred hours on the steam and non steam one, if you come in expecting an easy life with smooth grinding , your name painted on the scoreboards as the mvp then you might as well go back to ace combat. ill narrow it down for you, you will die and not typically die as in a heroic last man standing death, no you will and i mean will be one shot. pros -the game is very well optimised so even with my bad ping of 400 as long as the packet loss is low you can frag -war thunder did a good job at keeping realism to a point where it is realistic but not overly till the point you cant have fun-it isnt pay to win as you think, the premium currency can buy you vehicles but usually they are the same as the ones you can grind and unlock with the in game currency, the difference is they give you more exprience or currency gain -every tank has a weakness , if you think the big tiger was a threat wait till you see it get one shot by an m18 then you will change your mind. -new vehicles added in presents a challenge for new players expecially in learning on the basics, i really only used my rudder, flaps and etc like a few months into the game and once you do learn you can surpass thousand hour players-nothing is overpowered as i said before, every tank, plane and soon ships will have a heel to step on lets say the russians, in the most common tier 3 league we have the medium t34 , pretty strong from the front , good armour and a strong gun anddd its gone why? the ammo is located around the middle of the tank literally surrounding the crewmen next up is the sherman, strong frontal armor the best in its medium tank class , but its side armor is relatively thin and oddly enough the armor plate surrounding the armor bulges out and is weaker than the hull itself huh so yes every tank has an exploit for you to find , memorise where they are and you will be one of the strongest players in the game -over the years it had begun so much , ive been around before the ground forces and i havent sunk a single dollar into this game (im poor shut up) and im still actively grinding so yes the replayability is high with this game -this game will look good even on low unless you are one of the pc master race that owns an i3 -f2p , for a constantly updating game cons - one shots (you and the enemy can do that to eachother you arent op ) - anti social community , on servers i have been there is little to no talking in text mostly just people complaning about they got 1 hit or they died from a weird angle - teleporting back to where you were to receive a shell -team members may or may not assist you and maybe push you off a cliff either by accident or on purpose ill never know - the grind , its a grinding game which is easy for the first few tiers then you slowly think about buying golden eagles to fund your research because you have been playing the same tank for a few weeks already and you are still so far from getting the next tank in line and then probably when you do you have no cash for it so you grind for cash and the button to purchase it is tempting you -its file space is large so if you are going to need a lot of space for this baby notes play with a friend and get a discord going or something , playing with friends is good as you can watch your backs and increase the survival chance of you and allies, the community is funny sometimes so it will cause a laugh or two sometimes during an serious confrontation, there will be badass moments when you are alone and you can score 10 one shots in a row , or clutch the round with a lucky bomb drop from your aircraft either way, this game requires skill and a little bit of luck on your side recommend yes , this is probably the best free to play to get not many other can compare so i nominate it for the test of time award and 9/10",1

8814,"i believe that this game has a tooon of potential, especially to outweigh some of the other competition. the fact that this is on steam, where many people heavily rely upon to play the majority of their games, the chances of someone trying out the game increase tremendously. in addition, it'll be much easier for the developers to get purchases of battle passes and whatever else they may add, due to the fact that the steam wallet is much more flexible, as people are more likely to have leftover money after purchasing other games or items on steam.this is my list of pros and cons during early access, specifically alpha. pros gameplay pros clean ui, easy to understand symbols balanced classes (for the most part, and also from what i can tell) marked points on the minimap show up as transparent pillars in the map, very useful at all stages of the game a different style of dropping, no parachuting which is a nice touch for the pace of the game dispersion of chests/loot is nice, as you won't find things too close or too far away from each other variety of weapon choices class specific weapons & abilities (if you kill another player, you will not be able to use their stuff if it is class specific) tiers of weapons/armor (common, uncommon, rare, etc.) forging is very unique, allows for gameplay to be more in-depth toggleable mount/vehicle for longer distance travel (i like how it disables when you go indoors, as well as the cooldown) damage indicators pretty good hit-registration for its first week of play map pros very detailed map, with different biomes, like an ice one, forest, desert, etc. in the four corners graphics are pretty nice for a free game topography is shown, which is super cool (lets you know how elevated a surface is, so you can know if one spot is a mountain or not, etc.) labels for places in the map, as well as specifics (where every forge in the map is, and block coordinates [a1, a2, b1, b2, etc.]) other pros region selection for matchmaking not pay-to-win party finder for those who do not just want to fill lobby customizable options for crosshair reticles, audio, video, etc. controller support for those who would like a challenge i guess haha player rating (does not affect matchmaking queue as of now, however i would like there to be a list of ranks so we know how we're rated) report feature voice chat (i personally haven't used it that much, but it seems fine) the horse is very buff and the chicken is awesome :d cons gameplay cons limited inventory to two weapons, (the three max abilities is entirely fine) no indication of weapon statistics after picking up (when opening your inventory, the only option is to swap its slot from one or two) is now in the game! no indication of the flight path before dropping no manually reviving teammates (the chicken mechanic is nice, but not always ideal) sound cues are not always accurate or loud enough, this goes for me as well as a couple of my other friends who all have different headsets (turtle beach, logitech, razer, etc.) when opening chests, potions and other items may appear stuck inside of it, which makes it tricky to find an angle that lets you pick it up. auto pickup when running over it now! unable to drop potions you can drop them with ease now only third person (50/50, sometimes these royales are better or worse with only tp, i am personally fine with both) choppily moving zone, however that's expected from an alpha game map cons minor bugs with the landscape, i've run into a couple floating bushes or things didn't render properly (uncommon though, also note that i have the highest graphics settings) no current zoom mechanic on minimap other cons no current q&a, or common questions people may have regarding mechanics, may lead to confusion or people to believe something that is false (such as the chicken thing, and disenchanting) q&a/basics as well as patch notes in-game, good stuff. model stiffness, sometimes the animations just stop and the character goes into the gmod t-pose fixed now no colorblind mode yet, which would be extremely helpful for people like me who have difficulties differentiating the colored tiers of items tabbing out can take some time, occasionally crashing the game, not sure how often this will occurtaking all of this into consideration, the game seems to be going in a pretty good direction. i hope that the developers are very responsive throughout development, and later in the game's progress. i personally am not a huge fan of battle royales, i tend to play them more casually, however, i expect this game to be pulling in some more of my hours.overall, this game is a 9/10, and you should definietely consider trying it out, especially since it is free!",1
2952,"currently the game is no longer fun. gaijin is just over the entire community (unless your russian) and only see's us for the money in our wallet. we have been bring up, pointing out, and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse. the only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they 'might' pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel. however this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel. oh, by the way, they are under a nda which makes them completely worthless to begin with. an obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from gaijins part. the t-34-85 for example very rarely catches fire, explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly, and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank. there was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a 1.0 spread between vehicles to .7. so for example tiger ii's dont have to fight tanks from the korean war. last i checked the poll was at about 3,100 for yes and ~30 for no. gaijin has offically stated they will not change the br system and that it is perfectly fine. despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree.if you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier 3 is playing russian vehicles. also on a observasional note, the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations. just saying, they seem to be paying more attention to (a) certain nation than others.as the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste you'r money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian. the only reason i have not stoped playing thiscompletely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it.",0

15926,first off if your on of the people who only give a game one chance that last not even an hour expecting a hook to pull urself in then i urge you to wait put the game on your wish list and wait a while atleast till out of early access which should be soon (october 13).now if your the kind of person who is willing to take your time with something and experince the growth of a new game then i can truely recommend this game. artix entertainment takes heavy influence from previous games they made but reaches out and pulls similar ideas from mmo's for good or bad.the game doesn't push to be the ultimate flashy experince but offers a true crossplatform system that works wonderfully so you can game with your friends that may not have as beefy of a pc. also it is nice just to be able to open up the game for a quick run of a dungeon while on the go as well. as a mobile game this is top notch.finally i must add how excited i am for the class system so many games lock you into a certain play style and class but aq3d opens the doors for you to freely move between classes (though be warned only 3 classes avialable not including guardian hence my first point)so yeah i recommend this game to people who enjoy loot systems and mmos.,1

6651,"(tldr at the bottom)i won't even list the good parts about this game, because there are non that you could'nt find in any other generic fps. i'll just list some things you might be interested in:you think your skills from other fps transfer over?-well, kinda, except you will get yourkicked even harder by veterans than if you were to play planetside 2, which is pretty brutal for noobies toothink standard infantry men will cut it?- no. you will be sniped by an enemy sniper from hundreds of feet away, you will never see him, you probably wont get any openings if you do see him as he is with other enemies, and chances are he will continue to farm youruntil he gets bored. - you will die every single time with your semi auto poop launcher to someone with an smg. guaranteed.- you will get blown up by an enemy tank from hundreds of feet away. repetedly. these are very easy to flank, but guess what, as a new player, you have absolutely nothing to damage it with!!! i remember when i started out, i chased a panther for 15 minutes in hopes the comander would stick his head out so i could blow it off, but he didnt. i ended up diying because his coaxal machine gun clipped me and send me fliying into the air, because, just like every other terrible fps with this feature, momentum doesnt transfer over to you from the object you stand on.- snipers with onehit kill rifles will go in cqc, camp the attic of a building, and kill everyone that attempts to shoot them- they call your soldiers heroes, but your hero couldn't do the 50m dash for his life. the pu$$y can't even sprint across a road half the timethought about playing as a sniper then? want that one-hit sweetness?- too ing bad, the snipers are 2 hit kills (unless to the head, which is almost impossible when theyre moving) by default. to get the sniper to a one-hit to the torso, you need another 30 hours of grinding to get the credits to purchase the stuff you need, and another 10 hours on top of that to finish the ribbons that unlock the parts for purchasing- the ing sniper doesnt even come with a scope by default. you need to buy it separatly! also, the scope alone costs as much as the gun itself !!! (a 3.5x that is) if you want a higher magnification get ready for a 20 hour grind, just for the scope- an entire team of snipers will auto win the game, they will kill you long before you can travel from the base to the objective- really the only class worth playing if you don't feel like constantly going for the objectivefeel like playing airborn?- i'll admit this is a pretty cool class, you actually jump from an airplane and land where you want- pray to god that some tryhard pilot doesnt shoot you out of the sky before you land. these guys make me ragefeel like playing as tank crew?- prepare for the longest grind in your life- rambo's will ruin your day. trust me. getting rambo'd is extremely infuriating, however tankers deserver this since the tanks in this game have rediculous reload times on their cannons.- prepare to be sniped from across the map by another near invisible tank how about as an airman?- not a bad idea actually. hard to learn but rewarding.- borderline broken class. their bombs destroy everything within a 15 meter radius and they magically regenerate quickly- almost always top of the leaderboards, they earn a ton of points- because the devs don't play anything but airplanes (sarcasm) , they don't put a decent limit to how many max airplanes can be there at one time, then you get a bunch of tier 3 airplanes completely ruining the match (also, suicide bombing an airplane does absolutely no damage for some reason(feel like playing as a general?- might as well not, it's basically a stupid board game, you don't even fight, you just move forces across a map of europenew player expirience in general :- not getting a single kill in a match because the iron sights on the starting weapons are horrible- getting killed by heavy vehicles you can't even scratch- walking simulator. you arent provided basic transport, you have to buy it, until then, you are stuck with1- going with another player that has transport (assuming there even is one) and entrusting your fate to their driving skills, but i wouldn't do that (i'll explain later)2- getting a bike or a civilian truck. both are faster than walking but slow enough that you can be easily sniped blindfolded from hundred yards away.3- walking simulator 2018 (happy new year!!!)- the physics will make you laugh1- getting shot by a plane will kill you and send you 100 feet into the air2- getting shot by a tank will kill you and send you 100 feet backwards3- getting hit by a mine will kill you and send you 100 feet in a random direction4- getting hit by a car will kill you and send you 100 feet at a 45degree angle upwards5- when you finally do get a hold of your very first jeep or motorcycle, you will learn the horrors of driving. you think you can go fast just because you have a motorbike? well ... you should be able to ... but in this game, there are so many micro bumps in the map that going at them high speeds will send you ... flying... and will turn your vehicle in an unpredictable direction ... and in the 1.5 seconds it takes you to switch gears and go from 0 to barely moving, your head will be long blown off.- some of the longest grinds i've ever seen. honestly, this is almost as bad as sw battlefront 2, the only reason people tolerate this is because it's been here first. apparently at one point the devs doubled the price of everything...- poor game optimization. though this has been worked on in some patches, it's still pretty bad- the netcode does this stupid linear extrapolation stuff. basically, if the enemy moves side to side quickly, they will move furthar than they actually did, then they will teleport back to where they are on the server. you can imagine this throws your aim off.tl;dr- new player expirience is terrible- don't spend money on this, the devs are milking it dry before they have to eventually pull the plug- rambo's, aircraft, and tanks (basically most of the game) are infuriating to kill and be killed by- optimization problems- rip netcode",0

3338,"the only other br i have enjoyed besides realm royale before the developer team absolutely butchered it.it feels like a more polished and functional pubg, but i will refrain from calling it a pubg killer.outside of the quirky but enjoyable movement system with snowboards and hang gliders (no one uses the rock climb ability), it is essentially what bluehole pictures pubg could be once it is truly finished. everything just works, there is no clunkiness or choppyness - vaulting over obstacles won't leave you jumping flat against a wall for 3 hops before a vault triggers. gun play is night and day difference compared to pubg, where sometimes you feel like your bullets disappear in the air. it just plays and feels like a great shooter, which is something that has been lacking in the br genre. this will definitely remain my main game until cod blackout releases, and then it will be my alterate br experience. hopefully more and more people will give the game a chance despite the publisher, i was hesitant to, but every single quirk and original feature this game has grows on you quickly and you come to enjoy the game for what it is and not what it may become, unlike every other br in existence.",1
17375,"the only fun thing about this game is the flying, the rest is buy to win. litterally. quests are fun- at first. after about 20 minuets of a quest, it makes you go somewhere...where you have to pay real money to get there. you also have to pay real money to delete a character, you have to pay real money to make a new character, you have to pay real money to get another dragon or gear, and the game money is worthless. this game is free because you cannot complete a quest without having to pay real money. =s therefore, there is nothing to do in the game but paying real money.(best is 5 x, lowest score is 1 x) graphics: x hated graphics. it looks nothing like the movie, and certainly doesn't look like any other game iv'e played. gameplay: xx poor gameplay. like i said in the first paragraph, the gamplay is just quests you have to pay for. the only thing most people like about the game is you can fly your own dragons.lag: xxx i have never experienced lag or crashes in this game. it is pretty much the only thing they actually worked hard on.controls: xxx liked controls. controls for school of dragons are pretty good, a little to sensitive, but good.multiplayer: xxx people don't interact with each other much, but if you are in multiplayer, the better chance there is to recive lag.multiplayer chat: xxx like i said, people don't interact much in multiplayer, or chat. but, if bad people dicide to come in and say somthing bad in chat, it gives the person 3 chances to stop saying any bad thing he is saying, and if he doesn't stop- he will automaticly get kicked out of the whole game for an hour or so. cool, right? this game has crack security! it is positive, but you just can't play this without having to pay money. thanks, leave a comment on how you feel!! :3",0

14413,"the new 'reward' system has ruined the game in it's entirety. getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept, but there are multiple issues with this. - it removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck.- it encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates; i.e getting points from capping towers that are almost capped, is far greater than doing it yourself.- the item sell values make it near impossible to actually aquire items from the shop without massive ammounts of grinding.- premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want, and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want.- the premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept, but showing the players what they missed out on because they didn't put money into your game, even if they have in past (and got burned on it because of the recent changes) is just cruel.i played this game for a while before the recent overhaul, had quite a few high-tier blocks and high-tier weapons, the former of which cost quite a lot of ingame currency, only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player, meaning the amount of time i spend prior to the change was completely pointless, save for aquiring levels translating to more cpu. in summary; the recent overhaul screwed over a number players, myself included, the only progression available is that of pot luck, and has never been more pay-to-win, with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legendaires more readily available (in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want, far sooner than normal players.)",0

11109,"eternal is a card game with a playstyle that's modeled after magic: the gathering, and a card collection style modeled after hearthstone (but better!). it is completely free to play, with the helpful but unnecessary option of spending money on drafts or packs to help buoy your early game card collection. you get to keep all the cards you draft, and you also get a decent amount of shiftstone (the card-crafting currency) for each pack you open. the game is so free to play that i was compelled to basically donate to them so i could have an uninhibited play experience.this game is for all the people who enjoy playing magic, but have issues with the magic online program for any of the possible reasons. all i wanted to do with magic was just jam games for free and against quality opponents. third party software did not quite scratch that itch, so when i saw eternal was released i jumped on board and have really taken to it. this is perhaps eternal's greatest strength - the bingeability of the game - yet it can also be its greatest weakness. because people can just queue up indiscriminately, they play a lot more games than normal, and the dreaded variance sucks argument comes to a head more often, because you literally are more likely to be screwed by variance when you're increasing your number of games played. if you like to complain about variance, honestly, stop playing all card games, because variance is literally what makes card games fun. that or learn to accept your lord and savior variance mcgee into your life and keep a lingering smile on your face as the game engine hands you an unwinnable hand.the game design has done a phenomenal job with the first set, with an unbelievable number of playable archetypes in constructed mode. it won't all be tier one, but with as wildly as the meta shifts in this game, it can be fun to find that one random deck you played 2 months ago which you just realized has a strong matchup against the current meta. some decks will seemingly never die, but dire wolf digital has shown a willingness to step in and nerf cards it sees as problems, while also buffing a few underutilized cards a bit more rarely. gone for me are the days of learning the combat tricks in each color, which was a very fun process to learn much like a new magic draft format, but a new player will certainly delight in learning how to play around the opponent's tricks. until a new eternal set comes out, the intellectual enjoyment on my end predominantly comes from attacking the meta in a favorable manner.i've really enjoyed the product that dire wolf digital has put out, and i think it has a lot of portability over from any other popular card game a new player might be more familiar with. if you're new to card games, there will obviously be a bit more of a learning curve, but hey, this is completely free - might as well try it out!",1

5179,"product received for freeearly access reviewhuh where i even start...the game it self it's just another 2d party fighting game based on multiple gamemodes. once you start the game for the first time. you probably are gonna play free for all since it's the most gamemode played when you start playing it. you have 33 characters to use and more coming up, but there's only 6 characters to use for free per week you can also unlock characters with the currency of the game, each one with 2 types of weapons including the unarmed fists. the game it self it can be seen as a competitive game or a fun party game depends on the case your working.once i got 100 hours on the game i started playing the gamemode ranked. where i started learning a lot of the game and also some cool tricks to use like the gravity cancel, once i knew some combos with my main character (asuri) i started taking the game as something more serious since i never had a game that keep me playing it for that time. i started playing the game since it was around 4 weeks old. so i grew up with the game, i never wanted to search for combo videos since i wanted to learn how to play it by myself. so after 500 hours i had atleast 24 characters unlocked i was rank gold with only one skin buyed. since it was thoose days where i started using other characters instead of my main character. now that i passed the 700 hours i can already tell that i spend a lot of time of this game. around 4 hours per day. this game make me find new people who are now my friends. but as always nothing it's perfect. this the moment when i stop talking about the pros and start moving to the issues i have with game. the game itself it can be seen as a competitive game, but that doesn't mean your not gonna find people who probably be there just trying to be a jerk with everyone they found on the game. the game it'self has some players that take the game to seriously so they probably will try to win no matter what instead of having fun as the game it's supposed to be. so don't feel angry if you fight someone and after the match he left without saying gg or letting some insults in the chat, and also when they won they will probably will say ez instead of gg. to make the things more easier to explain, you will find a lot of salt on this game.at the topic of microtransactions. this game like almost every f2p game, have microtransactions, but that doesn't mean this is a pay to win game. since that the only thing you can buy it's character skins, k. o. effects, sidekicks, and avatars. so the microtransactions doesn't affect the gameplay itself. if i was a videogame reviewer, i will probably say that this game itself it can be funny to play but only with friends. but since i have 900+ hours on the game, the only thing i can say it's...and it's pretty amazingit's a pretty fun game.-rayzoomfox",1

3114,"this game has the potential to be one of the greatest flight sims ever. the selection of aircraft and tanks is absolutely enormous. there is a diffuculty mode for everyone, the flight models are decent, the damage model kinda sucks but it's not terrible. the aircraft and especially the tanks are very well detailed.i just wish i had the ability to enjoy them all. unfortuately, you can't. you will be stuck in the first and second tier early war stuff for hundreds of hours. i have a buddy who has been playing this game for years. he has over 1,300 hours in the game. he is a level 42. herein lies the problem of the game.you start off with the worst pssible vehicles, which is understandable. these are the bottem of the barrel planes and tanks. they are slow, they can not turn worth a damn, they have guns that mearly tickle your opponent, and they blow up when someone looks at you funny. you are stuck in these until you can get enough kill assists to unlock a new vehicle. you aren't killing anything with a 37mm cannon on the early tanks, or the pair of .30 cals you get in the peashooter. once you get those, you continue the grind upwards. it seems your first vehicle in any tier is just asking to be blown up. and, at every tier, every vehicle cost exponentially more. you would think that at higher tiers this wouldn't be a problem as you would be making more money, but you'd be wrong. you can take out a mustang, down two aircraft and return to base, only to find out that you still haven't broken even. at this point in the game, it can cost 100,000 lions to buy an aircraft and another 100,000 just to train the crew. it gets so goddamn grindy.now, the lower tiers are more fun. usually you can break even, fly against somewhat balance aircraft (panzer iv as a first tier tank. wut? i've put 5 heat rounds through the front, hitting crew every time, and they can still one shot me through the mantlet), and enjoy the game without having to worry about shelling out shekels to the jewish developers just to fly your planes. grinding to unlock a plane in a free to play game? understandable. grinding low tierjust to fly high tier stuff you've already got? not understandable.absolutely the most frustrating game i have ever played. and the worst part about it is how much potential it has. potential wasted by money grabbing penny pinching jews that are gaijin.",0

13568,"right, i've tried to like this game. i've got a significant playtime on a server with friends. i'm being as unbiased as i can. if minecraft didn't exist, perhaps creativerse would look better. as it is, by basing so much of its core gameplay off of minecraft, it really has no excuse to be this mediocre. this game is minecraft lite. it's minecraft made simple, with a lot of pretty blocks and cute pets, but basically nothing more. it's minecraft for the unambitious, the unimaginative. it's what you'd let your child play, if you thought she couldn't handle challenge or failure. in the process of lowering the learning curve, creativerse takes away the cool toys and leaves you with limits. no complicated redstone, instead have a wiring system that gets confused when you send two inputs into an object. no world-manipulation capabilities like pistons or dispensers; instead have logic gates made for you as individual blocks, and only the ability to turn off lights and open doors with wiring. no large-scale crop and animal farming, instead mine every individual crop. instead, feed/wash/harvest every individual animal, which you must also tame individually as it tries to escape or kill you. no risky death where your inventory falls into lava, instead respawn on this touchstone, which you can reclaim from anywhere in the world, place anywhere, and teleport to anytime.redstone and world-manipulation was the lifeblood of minecraft; the ability to change every block of the world was one thing, but the ability to make the world change at the push of a button, to imagine contraptions and make them so, that is why minecraft is timeless and so full of potential. there is no potential in creativerse. the game-makers think for you, and the player is limited by the makers' imagination as a result. hell, there isn't even rails or minecarts. early access is no excuse. in the time that this game has been in development, minecraft went from alpha to retail, complete with all of the core gameplay that gave the player so many possibilities. creativerse can't add more fundamental gameplay aspects without overhauling the game, so the future will likely bring only more pretty blocks and cute pets and nothing else.in other words, if you've experienced half of what minecraft allows you to do, then this game will make you very sad.",0

3627,"i got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money, and i have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase. over 4600 hours over a span of 5 years i've played this game and watched it grow, add new things. i was there from the hatless update april 14, 2011 up to the 2016 smissmas update. the game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decissions i wasn't very fond of. if its something valve are masters on it is to build a game that's all about the gameplay. its by their flawless designs that their games like left 4 dead, counter-strike and team fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day, despite some of them being decades old. looking at team fortress 2 it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games, especially when 2016 saw a surge of other class-based arena shooters like overwatch and battleborne (haha) i will say i played overwatch for about a year, it was the christmas of 2016 when i first got overwatch and at the start, i enjoyed it. but over the year i played it the sessions when i played it grew further and further appart, until i only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didn't touch the game. it was then i really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game, how it had been polished to perfection. something as simple as the loadouts, simple change of weapons could completely alter the playstyle of characters in this game, swap the engineer's wrench out for a gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the offensive rather than defensive. the medic's main weapon, syringe gun vs blutsauger changes whether he's a battle medic or not. the syringegun allows you a passive health regen of 4hp but blutsauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regen by 3 points, making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive, and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regen after escaping close encounters.that's only 2 examples of ways classes can change depending on their loadout. every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their loadout. in games like overwatch your hero has counters, meaning you can't master a class to the point where you're unbeatable because he's been designed around a rock-paper-scissors design to where some hero can take you out. in this game it was just about picking a class, selecting a loadout that suits your playstyle and going to town. there was very little counters, each class could take out the other equaly so long as you played it right. (with 1 class exception..) the community also helped make this game great, by offering custom game modes, custom maps, custom servers. it was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it, allowed the community to create and take part in it. something overwatch doesn't allow past letting them design skins.. what has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that i feel it has lost its way. many of the people i used to play with have moved on and the community isn't the same as it once was. the community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are minecraft servers with ads out the a*s to try and cash in ad revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favorite game. that's not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community, the dev team has plenty to do in it as well. trying to make the weapons balanced, the team went back and fourth with alot of the weapons in the game, improving some that were before worthless (like the quick fix) and but turning some before good weapons, bad. the problem is that when listening to a community, you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt. keep in mind, its not the people using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced, its the people getting killed by them that's complaining. much like how cod nerfed its shotguns down to being useless, the game killed alot of good weapons and ruined some peoples' loadout. but it wasn't also loadout changes, adding things like competitive play to the game, i still feel was one of the worst decissions ever. the games random crits system, is there for a reason. its there as a boost of luck, so that even if you're better than everyone else, you might have a critical rocket strike you, or a critical heavy or scout which you would've otherwise escaped from or defeated. could you imagine if cs:go had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg it'd count as a crit and kill the person? the community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and insta-kill the person they were shooting at. i no longer play team fortress 2, because the state its in is not one i like. i have played it a bit in recent times, but that was doing tour of duty with some friends, as mann vs machine is a gamemode i still enjoy. but even if i no longer play it, i will never forget the friends i made through it, i won't forget the trading i did through it, i won't forget the fun times i had on it. 4600 hours, amounting to more than half a year. some would call that a waste, but i wouldn't have traded those hours for anything. thank you for the memories team fortress 2.",1
7038,well 300 hours in game i can say that its fun but hella annoying n more or less all have to do with luck u can make good decks but still wont help u win if u get draws but still fun the dark brotherhood maps good n worth the 1000 gold each but dont spend real money its not worth it lol. in periods game wont load until u try many times n game can be unstable at times. u can pay to win but ive not spent any money on game but still got all the db maps and madhouse collection missing a couple decks so if u are pantient its not that hard to get. the seasonal reward cards are good but think its dumb u can forge them before theyre given as reward. kinda kills the fun. some cards too op n if u meet an opponant with too many of these u have no chance. id recomend it unless u get your day ed if u lose too much cause expect that to happen in periods n u will notice that the resistance from opponants differ very from what time a day u game but that goes for most games xd,1

2539,"if you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with war thunder! every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for golden eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.the russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! this most experianced in the mode realistic battle where it's nation vs. nation and the russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! the rng for russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off op ammo (some ww2 tanks have post war ammo)!you really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the mm is one of the worst i've ever seen! it doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them. don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse! a lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates 1.37 and 1.43 where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!",0

9421,"realm of the mad god is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by wild shadow studios (acquired by kabam in june 2012, and later sold to deca games in july 2016) and spry fox. it was in public beta from january 2010 and the browser version launched on june 20, 2011.[2] on february 20, 2012 the game was made available on the digital distribution platform steam for microsoft windows and os x.[3]the game has been described as a massively-multiplayer cooperative bullet hell shooter with an 8 bit pixelated art style.[2] players control characters who have been transported to the realm of oryx (the titular mad god) to become food for his many minions and abominations, which the players must dispatch. central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a limited capacity vault away from danger. different character choices in class also help make the game more diverse and help to support teamwork.the game is free-to-play with optional in-game micro-transactions. items which can be bought with optional transactions include in-game equipment vary from high-level equipment, pets that provide aid to the player (by attacking enemies, paralyzing enemies, healing the character, restoring the character's magic points, and acting as a decoy) increased storage space, and aesthetic features such as skins, cloths and dyes.[4]this game client is written in flash and can be played in-browser on the official site, on kongregate, or it can be downloaded from the google chrome web store. realm of the mad god is also available on steam.[5]contents [hide] 1gameplay2development3reception4references5external linksgameplay[edit]the game consists of players shooting projectiles from their weapons and destroying enemies to earn experience, fame, and equipment. a character moves around using the wasd keys (though other controls can be chosen) and uses the mouse to aim and clicks to shoot.[6] contrary to usual practice in mmos, the experience for killing monsters is awarded in full to each player present, rather than split. this, along with the possibility of teleporting to any player on the map instantly and a cooldown of 10 seconds to teleport again, makes it very easy and attractive to team up.after a certain amount of experience has been earned, the player levels up and their attributes are raised, allowing them to fight more powerful enemies and unlock more classes. the maximum level a player can achieve is level 20. the player can then gain fame on their character, which eventually grants permanent stars that indicate accomplishment and may entitle one to a place on the game's leaderboards upon death. character death is permanent, meaning that the character's items and statistics are lost.players begin their game sessions in the nexus, a safe haven which can be teleported to at any time. in the nexus, players may buy consumables using gold purchased with real-life money or they may trade with another character. another currency is fame, gained when you die. the player enters realms (i.e. game map instances present on the server). each of these realms are named after powerful monsters in the game(i.e. medusa, djinn, cyclops, beholder). the capacity of each realm is 85 people at once, and a full realm cannot be entered until a player in it dies or leaves. however, if many players enter a realm at the same time, it can exceed 85.players fight a monster in game. hud elements such as the inventory can be seen on the right-hand side.during gameplay, the player is directed to quest monsters indicated by a red marker at the edge of the game window. as they level up in the realm, they are guided from the lowlands areas at the edges of the map, through the midlands and highlands to the more difficult godlands in the center of the map. the godlands hosts powerful monsters known as the gods of the realm. completing certain quests allows event bosses to spawn, which can be killed to obtain higher-tier loot and open portals to the rarest dungeons.killing high-level monsters can grant the player permanent stat boost potions, which are rare and exist in eight variations that correspond to the major attributes(life, mana, vitality, wisdom, defense, dexterity, attack, and speed). consuming stat potions allows the player to improve their characters stats after reaching the highest level, which can be done until the attribute is maxed out (indicated by its text turning gold). upon death, the size of the grave left behind corresponds to the number of stats maxed. items could previously be retrieved from graves, but this functionality was removed as it led to players luring others to their doom to loot their graves.the 14 classes currently available are wizard, priest, archer, rogue, warrior, knight, paladin, assassin, necromancer, huntress, mystic, trickster, ninja, and sorcerer. players begin with only the wizard class unlocked and successively unlock the remaining classes as they gain experience with each class.[7] there are 8 main stats, defense, attack, speed, dexterity, vitality, wisdom, mana, and life. each class has its own weapon, armor and ability specifications, base statistic averages and statistic caps. for example, warriors, knights, and paladins have high defense and are the only ones that can use swords and heavy armor, while the assassin, rogue and trickster have the highest potential movement speed and dexterity (rate of fire) statistics and can only use daggers and hide armor.items are classified into tiers, with higher tier items having better stats. tiers range from t0-t12 for weapons, t1-t13 for armors, t0-t6 for rings, and t0-t6 for abilities.[8] some items are un-tiered, giving them a special classification. these items are typically unique, with examples including limited use items, powerful weapons, armor, rings, abilities, and april fools' day accouterments. the best items appear in special bags, known as white bags, purple bags, cyan bags, or potion bags. these bags will only drop for players who have delivered a certain percentage of the monster's damage, and can only be seen and picked up by the player it dropped for. un-tiered (ut) items are currently soulbound which means it is unable to get picked up by any other player or traded to another player.the game features guilds, each allowing for a maximum of 50 players. a guild costs the founding player 1000 fame to name and create, and has a guild hall which can be accessed by members of the guild. upon a member's death, guild fame is earned proportionally to the amount of fame that the player earned. guilds can buy upgrades such as larger guild halls and cosmetic features with the guild fame.[9]development[edit]the game was originally created by alex carobus and rob shillingsburg, founders of wild shadow studios, for tigsource's assemblee competition in october 2009, which limited the competitors to a very small sample of art resources.[10] the developers described the aim of the game was to shake things up by breaking as many mmo rules as we could[11] it was noticed and received a good response from players,[12] prompting the developers to work on a full game. the game was finally launched in a beta stage on january 10, 2010.[10]following the initial launch, spry fox joined the development team, helping bring the game to a full release out of beta on june 20, 2011.to help fund the game's development, optional microtransactions were added to the game, drawing a mixed response from players.[13] the developers defended the microtransactions, saying they seemed like the most convenient, customer-friendly way to pay for the game... those that passionately love the game, can spend as much as they want, helping us to grow the game over time.the game has been",1

8204,"i have many hours into this game. imo this game has something for everyone. pvp, grind, crafting, auction house, zen/ad economy & questing to name most. this is my suggestion: play the game for one month or to level 60 w/o spending _any_ money. find what you like about it and play that. then decide if its worth throwing money @ or worth raising another character (you get 2 characters for free account). monthly and seasonal events reward companions, weapon skins and, rarely, mounts. not to mention the role playing crowd (visit the moonstone mask).note this is perfect world entertainment so if you play sto or any of their other properties you already have an account. combat is commanded and _not_ auto-combat like most mmos. we must aim and target our spells lest we miss, and thus, perhaps, get to start over at the last campfire. i recommend:play with your friends! even w/o voice if you have a plan you _will_ win. (even in grey wolf den) ps if you dont have enough zen for something it will likely be on sale soon enough. check weekly for deals. edit: level capacity expanded to 70. new reason to play the game (again), endgame gear is no longer endgame. 4th increment of skills added. say hi to minsc, really.",1

15184,"product received for freeearly access reviewrecommendation: not recommended.81.9 hrs on recordearly access reviewso i will begin with the description of the game robocraft, it's purpose and what you do in it. brief description so... robocraft is a multiplayer game in which 2 teams must battle it out until the final survivor from 1 team. what makes this game unique? well you don't battle with cars or any other things, instead you battle with your personal created robot. this robot you create will matter highly how you create it if you want to survive long in the battlefield. how it works: you start off with a few tier 1 blocks as you do in the game, you build your basic first time robot and go into battle in order to get some credits. after a bit of grinding you have enough money to buy more things to add onto your robot like guns, wheels, rocket boosters, more blocks (blocks are classed as armor so the more and better you setup your robot the more hits it can take) and so as you keep adding things to your robot, you reach a robot reputation level if i remember correctly and once you pass a required robot reputation you tier up and unlock higher tier guns, blocks, wheels, boosters and at later game, wings, shields, propellers, helium tanks etc..so doesn't sound too bad right now does it? multiplayer game with custom created robots which can fly, hover or drive whilst fighting with guns, destroying other robots. but... at the beginning you couldn't notice a lot of p2w factors fbut there were some minor ones which didn't make a lot of difference, the one feature which many people would pay for are, custom created robots created by the developing team for different tiers. however after a few months things have started going slightly uphill with the amount of p2w things being released. so much that you can tell that the developers must be in a struggle. here's where they went really wrong. what they did wrong this is an honest review, and i honestly will tell you to stay away from this garbage. don't get me wrong, the game used to be good, it used too. now it's a terrible game and that's as kindly as i will go. what's wrong with it you ask? well they started bringing out absolute terrible and useless updates, i never saw worse updates for a game than that. it first started with an all of a sudden level boost for every single player for no reason which meant that all those players that spent a lot of time trying to reach the max level (100) wasted their time when they could have reached lvl 60 and have their level boosted till like lvl 85. then they brought out a new game mode, that game mode was so stupid that if you was not level 80+ you was wasting your time playing, this is because you was playing against over tiered enemies whilst you could be a hugely lower level. another thing, they made it so that you pay to win different colored blocks for your robot.. yes, blocks that have a different color. you have to pay real money for that now... oh and i just found out that they added a way for you to open crates to get super cool legendary weapons for no reason. yeah, this game was good it had good level progression, fair match making due to different tiered robots get tiered with similar tiers making it a fair match. now that doesn't exist and it all depends on how much money you got in your bank accouunt.i recommend you stay away from this game, it's annoying to say this because i would have kept playing this game if not for these updates. but hey, the game is free so if you're not conviced by this review, you can see it for yourself as the game is free. overall ratings uniqueness: 8.5/10entertainement: 6.5/10graphics: 5/10difficulty: variedenjoyable: mehpay to win level: 9000/10 personal recommendation 1. must get. 2. recommended purchase. 3. recommended purchase during sale. 4. not recommended unless heavily discounted. 5. not recommended.",0

8260,"i will give this game credit. it's not what i expected.you hear mmorpg and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. it handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).the progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. my only gripe with combat is that, at least on the warlock i started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. this is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. however this is somewhat typical of a lot of mmos, and while it's a bugbear of mine and i'd prefer it to not happen, i've sort of grown used to it from when i played tera. enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. i see this as both being good and bad; good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.the economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. the map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because i couldn't find the right vendor).i hear people say there's p2w in the crafting. and there might be, but i haven't gone into crafting at all so i wouldn't know. what i will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. the classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. character creation is straightforward (thought i'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and i'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. your milage may vary, but as a f2p game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?",1

8181,"oh where to begin with neverwinter. now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.neverwinter is a f2p mmorpg published by perfect world. now a lot of perfect world games tend to be pay to win to the extreme. neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. the only thing to win in neverwinter is pvp, but pvp isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in pvp. of course neverwinter has an in-game currency called zen that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing zen lets you buy are fashion items, dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. now of course like many other mmos, in game currencies like zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. is that pay to win? no, it is not. what are you winning? a race to the quest area? people do not like spending real life money on mmos, but the game is free is it not? so complaining is silly. anways, the main currency in neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called astral diamonds. you don't want to spend real life money on neverwinter? have no fear, with ad you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. though for a price. 25k ad is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a purple item. purple items sell for a fair amount of ad on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1mill. so really, earning ad is not an issue. me? i've played neverwinter since beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items i desired. i just played the game and earned ad, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. the point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. but many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. i also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade ad for zen? isn't that nice that neverwinter allows you to do that? they give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. i don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a free game. in game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! now lets talk about the workers behind neverwinter that are really a great group of people. they constantly work hard daily to keep neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. the employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. its very important for a game to have that. they also play neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. how cool is that? they also stream on twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like t-shirts. so overall, neverwinter is one of the best free to play mmos out right now. there's a reason i've been playing this game since beta. it even has an epic story line unlike many other mmos that don't. like everybody else, i skip dialog, i don't care, i just want to play. with neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. don't believe me? check out my screenshots and look at my neverwinter ones. you'll also see that i have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning ad.like mmorpgs? want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? do you like dungeons and dragons? then take the time to play neverwinter",1

9353,"i really do need to play this game more to really explore whether or not i reccomend it. i'd feel bad leading people on that this is somehow a great game if it was only mediocre.one complaint i'd like to get out before i praise it, is the bureaucratic mess that is unlockable content. i am unsure how one earns those playable classes that remain behind a sealed window, and that's what turned me off to playing further than the 30 minutes o the first adventure i did. it wasn't that it was not fun, but i don't like being treated like a lab rat with prizes dangled in front of me i have to pay for. i'm paying enough investing time and effort. these games are hardly ever a breeze and more of a chore to get good at.but that's realm of the mad god's saving grace... is it doesn't really matter if you get good. in the end i don't think those unlockable classes would make much difference in game, as if you die, you die permanently. much like some of the first ever pc games that were dungeon crawls, and it gives it an 8-bit aesthetic that is both appealing, but also a little cumbersome at times to makeout where exactly the enemy is coming from. it isn't like my squinty filipino eyes were made for 5000fps bits of fireball spam.what the game does right, and few other games do is reward cooperation and ignoring competitiveness completely. there is no competition, you can't even make it so by player-killing, and i like that a lot. players are free to go their own way and die quicker if they so choose, but the real strategy is to stick together and make the most out of every player's utility.it is free, and because it's not some cut-throat pvp you should give it a try and decide for yourself since my gameplay amount is rather limited. but i might go back to it if i feel like i could get 100% of the experience at some point. again, my only real distancing came from the fact i felt like i was being scolded for being a freebie and couldn't have access to certain classes.",1

2133,"i plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoa 100% free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. it's like diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. story- you are exiled and left in a continent or place called wraeclast. you venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in wraeclast.gameplay- you select various classes: maurauder (melee/tank), duelist (hybrid of melee/range), ranger (archer), witch (mage), templar (hybrid), and a scion (unlock after 1st act). so there is a character for just about any play-style. destroy the many hordes of creatures in wraeclast to gain experience and level up. you get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. you get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. and poe boasts a massive skill tree that i have ever seen in games. the skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. online/co-op- there is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. there are guilds to join. you can trade some of your gear with other players. there's also pvp, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. cons- minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. you think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. it can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. but it's a minor gripe.conclusion: if you like diablo games, give this a try. game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. there's plenty to do. the game today is completely different from when it was first available. most importantly, the game is free!! the only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. this was the first game i ever put over 100 hours into on steam, and it was worth it.",1

14129,"infestation | the newzbefore you read, i would like to say that i have over 300 hours on this game before steam release.infestation | the newz, is an official rework of the original (and bad) title infestation | survivor stores, formerly known as the warz, the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called fredaikis ab, there is not a single dev from the original iss on this development team.everyone knows the warz and how bad the game was. it was riddled with hackers, it was seriously pay to win, loot was rare, so it made hackers even more populated, it was full of bugs that devs did not patch, and lets be honest... there was no content. all there was to do is pvp.now... on the other hand, fredaikis ab, the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did, they are listening to the community, and trying their best to make a game that you guys want. they have released an anticheat called mlg anticheat, this anticheat was designed just for this game, i have over 300 hours before steam and i have only got cheated once. i repeat once.due to the lack of content the previous game had, they made about 10 different pvp server maps, so you can hop into it and pvp right away, they made a custom br, they added airdrops, (these drop about every hour) on official servers, they have revamped the ui, they have added alot of guns that the original iss did not have. and armor,helmets etc. and they added skins <3 traders dream! they have completely removed the pay 2 win aspect of the game, now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market. they have not removed (gc) gold credits, you can use this to purchase a private server to loot, or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place. this is just to support this game and keep it alive.some of you guys need to understand, they need to have a few things they can make money off of. a game is not free, they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that 10,000 people are playing on.",1

179,"the game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring. every 100 rooms (=1floor), there are generally 2 or 3 stuff happening, a big room (which is actually multiple rooms) with spooky stuff, a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor, and some notes left by some dude for you to read. otherwise you're just walking through the same rooms over and over. sometimes you think a room is important but it's actually just a regular room with nothing special. oh and jump scares.but when you're not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas.hopefully it's free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you're wondering if you're not paying the game with your time.",0

10841,"i started playing magic the gathering back in middle school and continued through highschool. unfortunately once i graduated and my group of friends moved on, i gave up the game. our group was never competative (i'm sure most of us never realized that magic tournaments existed), we just played the game to have fun.i learned that magic online was a thing that existed shortly after it released, but learning of the pricing scheme there was no way i was going to get involved with it (and this is coming from someone that was willing to pay a monthly subscription to mmo's). it just seemed rediculous to me to pay for digital cards...when they weren't actually collectables in my mind. pc gaming was always my main hobby even during my magic years, and quite frankly there are tons of pc games better than what magic offers.fast forward to today and eternal.the game has everything that magic should offer to a player. it has an excellent deck building system that lets you quickly and easily sort your collection even as new cards are added. it has a variety of game modes, including both competative and non-competative options which is very important for me as i need to be in the right mood to want to play vs. another player. it has great characters and an interesting setting that stands out from other games. but the most important thing eternal has is fun.the game is fun.i really appreciate how the developer (dwd) has taken the time to realize that they aren't creating just a card game. they are making a computer game. they have taken the solid foundation that magic has built and turned that into a game that is actually modernized for play in the internet era.each game takes ~5-7minutes usually and with how they have structured their game modes and rewards, you still feel like you are making progress towards earning new cards even if that one game is all you have time for. if you are playing one of the modes versus an ai opponent, you can even leave mid-game and come back later if required.the most recent (aug 2017) feature added was an excellent puzzle mode, which to me harkens back to scrye or inquest what's the play puzzles. even though i have been playing the game for about a year i was surprised how many tips for new players they were able to add into the puzzle mode to give you a little bit of a strategic level up after coming out of the tutorial. i am so happy i found this game and honestly very excited for its future. an account long-term progression mode is coming soon and i am interested to see what that offers.",1

13662,"first off i would like to say that this game has among the best community of players i have ever encountered online. everyone is super helpful and nice, very collaborative and community oriented. let's keep this trend going!now this is a sandbox game!i am absolutely loving this game, it's addicing and rewarding, everything about this game is fun to do.a breif overview of the game.you start off in a random location on the world map, which currently there are only 4 variants off which is unfortunate, but hopefully soon they will be procedurally generated. you have a twig with which to hit things to kill them and harvest their loot, and a basic mining core/gauntlet. you go kill piglets, boars, leafis, things of that nature to collect hide, tusks, sinew, bone, etc. as you travel you can collect the trees, dirt, water, honey, etc in order to upgrade your mining core. build up your core, mine around, explore, fight things, collect flowers/mushrooms. make a forge and processor, create armor and weapons, other neat things. furniture, what have you.mining ore in this game is different. instead of clicking on it and standing there until you pop it, you place an extractor on the ore node which will harvest it for you, giving you time to go and look around for more ore while it processes. come back and poof, there's 12 coal ore, or obsidian or what ever it might be. it's a very interesting take on it and it's a lot of fun. well anyway i'm rambling on about nothing, but it's a lot of fun and it's still in early access. tons of fun, and immense potentil. overall rating8/10 oh, also, if you are crying about the game having a price tag now, get over it. grow up, get a job. it's 20 bucks. that's like, what, less than 2 hours of work? i see so many people complaining about how they ruined the game and made it pay to win - it isn't. you can either a) pay nothing and expierence 100% of the game, or b) pay the nominal one time fee of 20 bucks, and get a bunch of goodies, and be able to create multiple worlds, and also help fund the dev team for more updates in the future.stop being so entitled to free stuff. this real life. money doesn't grow on trees. nothings ever free.",1

14449,"it is p2w grindfest.newest update changed system to something we have seen in hearthstone. now you receive random loot instead of money after a match. this pretty much means you will spend most of your time grinding aimlessly for poor 25% robits(equivalent to hearthstone dust) rate to get parts you want. any building is also now limited to one robot as you cannot use one part in multiple builds, i scrapped all my robots from pre-update to buy half of weapons for my main one. it is hearthstone where you can only use your legendary card in only one deck.however grind is not biggest problem of this game. it is kinda annoying when you are at rank 24 an someone playes legendary card in hs, in this game it is much worse. legendary weapons are constant pain in thefor you as they are pretty much just better.pre-epic loot it matched you with people who had unlocked same stuff meaning weapons gettin powerful was not a problem. it was also not p2w but more like pay to progress faster, which is something to consider p2w but also it didn't really afect you as f2p player. nobody cared about how many parts you owned because level was your limiter.on top of this railguns are t.",0
