3605,"team fortress is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. in the + hours i've spent with this game running, i've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who i respect and value dearly, made $, at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. it's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in college were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now. i was once a free-to-player. i played it for a good months before deciding to finally try being a premium. that's how it got me. i first bought a unique 'huntsman' from the in-game store. then i found a phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, i tried selling it for $ on tfoutpost. those were simpler times. from there i ended up investing $ (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. i could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but i really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. this is a very fun, very addictive game.it is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. at any given time, there's anywhere from ,-, players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game i've played. you will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. you'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.in light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell valve what they want and actually see a response. it's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. for many people, such as myself, i'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and i'll always be thankful for the time i've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences i would not have been able to otherwise.for the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, i give team fortress a very warm recommendation. just know when to put it down, remember, hours is close to months playing /.",1

6433,"this game is a really mixed bag, so it was hard to me to decide whether i recommend it or not.but now i've made up my mind, i do not.the game itself is really enjoyable with different maps and career paths to take.there's a lot to like in this game.however a lot of these types of games get ruined by their economy or atleast fractions of their economy and h&g is no exception.the guns are overpriced and overpowered. if someone uses real money to purchase a gun you'll feel it, the game is very much, pay to win.free credits are not well balanced, specifically designed to be hard to earn to buy new weapons, so that you'll be more tempted to use your hard earned cash.you think that if a game was to have hard to earn rewards, it'd take a planetside approach, and make all guns have strengths, weaknesses and be overall balanced. but they are not. the thompson for example is the be all end all of submachine guns, i picked one up from an enemy and a quick burst of bullets to the chest was all it took to down an enemy.however with the grease gun, america's starting smg it took around , requiring the full clip if you miss.the german starting smg is also stronger than the grease gun as well.there's not a large variety of guns either, which makes me question it a little, considering that i remember a larger array of weaponry in similar ww shooters.the game is fun, refreshing even, however the unfairness of it's economy and weapon tier system really ruin the fun.unbalanced weaponry and inconsistent weapons between both factions, leaves something to be desired.this game would really benefit from leaving it's limitations, creating a third fictional faction to make battles ways, or even adding the ability for way battles which would include weaponry specific to that faction based in that time frame.this game is in need of a massive overhaul in order to improve player satisfaction and balance between all players, new and long running.also, a quick mention for server maintenance, this game is riddled with it, atleast % of the time when i want to jump on, there's server maintenance, and this isn't for short periods of time, these are long downtimes, that when the time to be taken is predicted, takes anywhere from to hours, and when the maintenance is unexpected bugfixes or anything along those lines, the game can be done for a whole night, with no time given to players as to when it'll be back up.my verdict: a good game turned sour by it's online shop./",0

2358,"path of exile is an interesting concept. an isometric dungeon crawler reminicent of games such as titan quest or diablo. if you expected an actual, detailed review of the game you came to the wrong textbox. reviewer's note:one should take into account that i only spent a few hours playing the game, hardly even bothering to take the time of day to make one single playthrough. though do not let that discourage you from trying it out.here is a quick summary for those, who like me, have no cash and want to try out a couple of fp games. you constantly rerun the the same levels on increasingly higher difficulties, all the while aiming towards getting certain items and skill points for your insanely complex, copyed off some youtuber's, build and amassing an insane amount of loot (downside: you have a finite amount of loot space which is shared with all your ingame characters, which can be increased through microtansactions). this leads to something called loot-lock where one must technically transcend the fp barrier. but by that point you should be pretty much well invested in the game.the game in my opinion is unique in the way that it offers a daunting amount of possible builds and character specifications, which i suppose allows for an interesting replay value for those of you who dig that sort of thing. the highlight of this game is its stellar community. nowhere have i met a more helpful, friendly and relaxed bunch of nerds who are ready to help you get started and enjoy your new found path of exile (from society).all in all this game is well developed and by far one of most unique and grindable fps on steam. just not my type of game :)",1

16710,"this game started out very promising. it was a fun grind with lots of different permutations of options in terms of towers/upgrades/bloons. however when you start playing battle modes and go against anyone above (win ) they just spam you with either blimps or ing zebra bloons. blimps you can sell yourand buy stuff quick enough to stop, but when they spam regen zebra bloons it's game over % of the time. i've lost thousands (from s to actual and bets) against these stupid spamming kids. there is literally no way to counter it no matter what i do. i don't try to do it to others because that's dirty and i say late game and mean it. when somebody says late game and then zebra or blimp spams you early you should have an option to block them so you never have to play against them or with them again. there should be a report option for the idiots who say late game and then don't late game, honestly. it's the dirtiest thing ever, it's like saying you haven't looked at your cards in poker and having the nuts or saying youll quickscope battle someone in cod and then knifing them or pulling out a machine gun. i don't know how you sleep at night if you play like this, but hopefully with a knife through your ing skull when someone you spam out like a noob tracks you down and kills you in your ing bed. i'm ing tired of losing all my money and having to wait hours over and over for spins because i'm way ahead and some ing kid spams me with ing zebra t. good game if you want to break your mouse/keyboard/closest thing to your computer/monitor. however, if you're a rational human being, don't download this game. even though it's free, it'll cost you more than other games because of the rage it induces.not to mention there are a bunch of trolls in the comments and in most games. absolute trash. you only get to pick three towers which is meant to be tactical, but leaves lower levels stuck on certain towers (having not had the money to purchase higher level/tiers yet) and forces you to pick banana farm as one of your towers. banana farm forced meta is just ing gay.",0

9833,"tl;dr: it's your typical korean mmolong version:so i think i've wasted enough precious hours to this game to state some glaring problems with it. it's more hours than what steam says, i started before the steam greenlight if memory serves.. weeaboo simulator. free play, pay win system. the entire cash shop is a joke.. pvp is broken, especially with new classes and it's full of cheap hoes spamming autotracking skills and the sort. my experience with the community was terribad with s leaving in the middle of a game, not being very supportive, and generally being s. absolutely atrocious drop rates of items. i don't know if i was just that unlucky, but i had to constantly redo dungeons for the job advance quests, which consist of annoying, repetitive chores like defeat this boss x times and get y items. the worst is the combination of those two - get z of boss drops. so if the random number generator didn't agree with me (which happened a lot), i had do the dungeon all over again. it's all horrible luck based bull that wastes hours of time and stamina, which brings me to the next issue.. the asinine stamina system. run out of stamina, can't play any more dungons for the day, unless you pay more. just, why? i decide when to stop playing, not the game. (i think it has to do with a law in south korea that limits how long kids can play). the game's definition of balance may greatly differ from yours. or they may not care at all. which seems to be the case since these new characters recently are all about let's make this class more epic than the last and end up utterly breaking the gameplay as a result of these obnoxious wanks showing off.. grinding for levels, job advancement, farming for items, pretty much the entire pve gameplay in general gets stale, boring and repetitive after a while, especially with the stamina system and hyper op guys running around flexing their paywin benefits killing any potential enjoyment. dungeons are as linear as linear can be.honestly, i can't say that i didn't have some fun with this game. this is a korean mmo, and korean mmos love hyper, epic and flashy combos that with fast paced action can give your eyes quite the colorful seizure. the skills look cool when you're running around beating up stuff and it's mildly exciting with a full party, especially when you're ganging up on bosses whacking the ever living daylights out of them. the game has its moments. it just gets old and routine pretty quickly, especially at higher levels where leveling and quests becomes a little more than a drawn out chore that gets increasingly stretched out by the dumb stamina system. check it out if you don't mind these issues and the microtransaction advantages, but i personally would just invest my time in a good game.if you like the game, you may want to consider void elsword. it's a private server without the bs of na from what i've heard.",0

16394,"picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting, especially being free. i was wrong.the developers put a lot of work into this game. the models in-game are based on real world models. every part is labeled with it's correct name, down to the smallest pins, rollers and springs. if you are detail oriented, mechanically-minded, or simply curious, this will be up your alley!whether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function, check this game out. i don't even consider this to be a game, but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side. there are pay aspects, but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns, such as military vehicles, race cars, even skeletons, etc. as for progression within the gun world, it's free.the game consists of assembly, dis assembly, function, games (including a firing range) and even painting the firearms. you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can, without hasty clicks, and without errors for extra points. it's very challenging (and i'm adept at this using actual firearms). the x-ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm, even while firing, reloading, safety on-off, etc. this is what i liked the most about it.in the real world, one can take apart an actual gun, learn the names of the parts, and understand the basic functions; but to see the pieces in action (while inside the gun) gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together.the models are pretty good looking too. they aren't super high res, but they aren't low-res either.my only two complaints with this game:- the way one moves around the gun/parts to get a different angle is awkward, sometimes frustrating, but it's not game-breaking bad...not by any means; just an annoyance at times.- some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be. for example: the ak-, one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle-butt before removing the rifle-butt (in real life). the game penalizes the player if the pouch isn't removed first though. this problem is more of a developer's attitude of you have to follow my procedure, even if it's not necessary in the real world. this is not game-breaking either, but very frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors.overall, i would recommend this game, %./",1

3977,"the meet your match update. i met my match alright, because i can't stand this horrible update. i've been a long time player, been here since the replay update back in may of , and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me. the biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! you're done! nope, with the newest epic content update, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode' casual mode now casual mode is its own can of worms. during the launch of this update, you couldn't even choose the map you wanted to play on. you picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. it goes something like this:. choose the map and mode you wish to play. enter the que and wait up to minutes to get into a game. join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server. the map ends, everyone disconnects. repeat steps - until you die of old age you might be thinking just go play on community servers! if by community servers you mean only fort/dustbowl then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. but for a game with different maps spanning across game modes, i think i'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there. there are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't i play on some of them? mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or amazing trade servers. i hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about billion of them to choose from! i live on the east coast of america and mainly play at night. i can hardly ever find a match with players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/fort. this is unnacceptable. where the hell are all the k players at? competitive mode i don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. personally i believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had had this mode added. this is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right? wrong. as far as i know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. plenty of time to polish some of its features up. but yet again, valve somehow managed to screw it up. no class restrictions, telephone number required or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards. no class restricitions is self explanatory. you can have about engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but if you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue. the telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to valve? cough up that $ buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club. now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve -damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update). last but not least, no real rewards. valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. they could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level or even level . but instead, you get nothing. you upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot. in conclusion tldr this update sucks and i advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again this is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.",0
2668,"..short summary: play russian or get rekt!and you will get banhammered % if you say anything negative (not even slander, just some negative comment is enough!) on their forum or website - typical russian attitude.---long summary:could have been a good game but russian/tanks and planes are totally op... who would have guessed, devs are russians.don't bother start as any other faction than russian. for russians the game surely is fun smacking everyone and everything...should they ever change that and balance the russian faction to be in line with the others i will change this review... lol but i guess hell freezes over before that day...*edit:on a second thought i guess this review will stay negative forever, since some funny mods deleted a thread of mine where i pointed out the massive ongoing bias during the current ww chronicels event.background:german facion is outnumbered on every single match and having worse tier tanks aswell, which climaxed yesterday in a v sb and vs rb thats just super dumb.it started on vs and was already hard but their beloved russians still lost some games. so they changed it to vs which completely crushed german faction.historical you say? i would too, but they did the same on ever single day of the event. even during the poland invasion, poland pictured as soviets outnumbered the germans v and it was unwinnable. loloh and did i mention censoring? every issue whitch reflects their bad work on updates or stuff where they create more imbalance than before on their forum and in the steam group is being almost immediately deleted or locked and put in archive without any reason given.if they would just communicate with the playerbase once they could have really easy solutions for long lasting problems, but they prefer not to get involved and banhammer everything instead - just russian style.day by day the same shít...---..tried an event - t vs centurionin short british x . tanks vs russian ., ., .you may imagine the matches were full off russian tanks and nowhere a brit tank to be seen...but no russian bias right?... this is so big time bs---having several factions unlocked i can now draw direct conclusions. the deeper you get into this game the more and more biased it gets.some really biased and game ruining hard facts:- fire on russian planes extinguishes like % of the time, it burns a while keeps flying and then viola fire is out magically *russian magik fire extinguisher*. all other nations just burn down % of the time...- hit russian tanks into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happens... nothing! hit other nations on same place, instakill!!- kill the commander on a german tank, even if gunner still lives the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore. kill a russian commander... nothing tank can fire normally.- kill german gunner while reloading, gunner is replaced and reloading starts from anew. kill russian gunner during reload, reloading continues from the point where it was before the gunner died :)- russian it missile has an obvious bug and can fly trough solid buildings and walls wich you can't penetrate with tank shells or any other missile carriers. it's been reported months ago, still no fix and i don't think it ever will be...- gunners on bombers lol, british, german and jap gunners on full level are fairly useless. they hardly hit planes chasing you on m.russian gunners are of course all pro snipers, hitting planes on km and taking them down rather easily. not sure how many kills i made on russian bombers, but it's an ridiculous amount. i'd be really curious to see stats about that...us bombers are soso, due to immense turret numbers they may hit sometimes too and take chsing planes down. but just sometimes.- general game mechanic problem, the better you play (currently % avg position here) the more you get uptiered. in solo queue without my not so good clan members i get uptiered into + br like / matches. so you end up playing the whole match as aaa since your tanks are mostly useless in + games.",0

13495,"of writing this review, i can't really recommend this game. i think it has a lot of potential, but there are certain aspects that are really bothersome for myself.pros+great artwork+a lot of fun options to personalize your builds+cute animals and charater designs+free to try, $ to upgrade to pro if you likecons-constant lag spikes and frame stuttering-nauseating jumping animations(especially bad with simultaneous lag spikes)-lack of npcs or npc villages(the game desperately needs some life)-tamed pets don't help in combat(no buff, attack or anything, would be nice if they added this feature)i think the artwork is great. its much easier to look at than unmodded minecraft. i like the ability to rotate blocks. give's you a lot more control over your buildssaw a guy make an ai tic tac toe game, using the machine system they have(like minecraft redstone)the breaking point for me is the lag spikes. i can only assume it is due to their servers or perhaps because they haven't gotten to the polishing stage in their development. i get lag spikes and frame stuttering constantly when i play and it has become almost nauseating. if you pair that with the really bouncing jumping animations, its a pretty horrible experience. i usually stay away from mountainous areas because of this. almost have to close my eyes when i jump because of motion sickness. they need to make the jumping animation smoother and figure out whats causing all these lag spikes. it seems like a hot topic and they said they are looking into it, but until its fixed, i personally can't play it. perhaps others won't have any issues.it would be cool if there were an option in the world settings that you could toggle to add sloped blocks to every edge of every block when the world was generated, so you wouldn't need to jump. i did this to all the the blocks around my house because jumping was so unbearable. it looks and feels great like this, so smooth running up and down surfaces.the world desperately needs some kind of npc villages. i know they're trying to be different than minecraft, but it's basically a minecraft copy and one of the great things about minecraft was the npc villages. a little bit of a life in an otherwise bland game. tamed pets helping you in combat would be great. maybe limit it to a few or if they don't fight, maybe they provide buffs or useful utilities like providing a light source or something. this would add a fun dynamic to the game. currently, i just used them to farm materials. it's ok, but perhaps they will add combat options for pets in the future.more block options. i'd love to be able to use all those unique blocks like the thin snow top that sits on top of blocks in the snowy areas. would love to be able to place that on the roof or something. perhaps, i missed it.i know they're working on a option to place items like food onto surfaces. that would be a great addition.and easier way to heat your home in cold environments other than putting a fireplace or fire every - blocks. i know a lot of people complain about the pro pack costing money, but i honestly see the pro pack as the full game purchase. you must pay $ for minecraft and i understand paying $ to unlock this game. i think the creativerse model of try before you buy is a great idea. game companies need to make money somehow, i get it. you still get to play % of the game for free. aside from the pro pack, the only other stuff locked in the store are the cool texture packs like galactic and medieval and a few specialty items. they're inexpensive to purchase. you can build amazing things without ever purchasing these packs.so, until they fix the lag spikes and jumping animations, i personally can't recommend this game. if and when they manage to fix it, i'd be happy to upgrade to pro and continue playing.",0

3602,"this game can be played both casually or competitively, as an ex-comp player, trader, coach for newer teams, and the all round pub stomper, i can say that this game has taken up a lot of my free time. learning each class is a new experience and opens up another dimension to the game in which you have never seen before. a few examples are medic, which showed me how important heals were in a game; soldier, which opened my eyes to the sky and any place up high; scout, for his mobility and how easy it was to get around. those are just some of the reasons why you should play this, it immerses you in a rapidly changing environment where you have to change yourself to improve mid-game.-- edit --the new casual matchmaking system has allowed for quicker games. it has brought together the worse players so that they can learn from the pros by playing alongside them. the community servers used to house closed communities of people, but now it is one big community of general tf players connecting across the world! the stronger communities like surf, jump and mge still stands, however now there are less trolls and people tend to only go there if they want to actually play it.the competitive matchmaking however can be given a boost. not a lot of people play it as it can be horribly unbalanced. a good team of can easily beat any mismatch of solo queuers.",1

2564,"this post is mainly for the most recent event where players were told they could win an e- premium german tank. here's a few reasons on how gaijin royally screwed up, as they have done so many times before. you have to play russia to win. i payed $. for a dog tag to gain access into the thunder league to play the event. i was excited at first, in fact my first few games were goign well. we won more than we lost and even the losses weren't that bad because you could hop back in right after the game was over and try again. so thus day one ended and i placed , (you have to be in the top to get the tank). so not bad, i'm thinking that i have all day sunday to improve my ranking. this is where gaijin, once again, screwed over its players and community. i logged back into war thunder to participate in the event. i like the american line and had been using my m tiger and m pershing the day before. i get into the event and my tanks aren't there. what? instead, there is the ma series of tanks such as the e jumbo and the premium calliope. so i go out in the jumbo and we are paying against is's and a t-. i get one-shotted times and our team loses. no one on the enemy team loses a life. and it's not just this way for america, no no no. all countries are set to certain tanks to make the game more fair so in other words, one has to play the russian line to even have a shot at gettign kills because everyone who plays war thunder knows, russian tanks are op.so needless to say i had gone wins and losses the day before to straight losses in a row with the same team the next because we could not kill the russians unless we played as the russians. and since i don't prefer to play the russian line, and enjoy my americans, this really blew. so thank you gaijin for once again trying to balance a game and making it worse. this hasn't only happened this one time but many others, i guess this was the final straw.",0

13123,"this game is both fun and stupid. i recommend this game because you can play its full potential without paying*fun, cute little graphics with a familiar fallout theme. a slight “tiny tower” type of dweller management and room upgrades. an addition of quests, funny dialogue and sometimes difficult missions makes this game pretty dang enjoyable.i played this game as long as i did only to complete all achievements… with that being said, i'm going to help you get them all.note: there is “almost” no way you can earn all achievements without paying (or cheating). i was able to get / by with some patience and allowing the game timer to run overnight and during the day. i’m only listing a few of the non-obvious achievements, or, some difficult ones with tips that might help you get them a bit faster. keep in mind to check your vault in the morning and at night. should take several weeks to complete them all.quest achievements:---big pharma (collect stimpacks…)---decorator (collect all pieces of themes)---survivalist (complete quests)the key with these is to constantly have dwellers on quests at a time.time-consuming achievements:---fashion statement (collect legendary outfits)---armed and dangerous (collect legendary weapons)---interior designer (craft of every room theme)with these, keep x outfit and x weapon being made at all times. they must be legendary and keep in mind what type of special is needed to make it go faster (this depends on what you are making.) also keep the crafting room themes going at all times as well.the two hardest achievements:---get off my lawn (stop raider attacks)the reason i’m stating this as a hard achievement is because if you progress too fast, raider attacks become very few and far between; raider attacks depends on the quantity of dwellers you have. - dwellers = raider attacks. - dwellers = raider, ghoul attacks. + dwellers = raider, ghoul and deathclaw attacks.with this being said; + hours in, i stayed steady at about dwellers and completed all but the blast from the past and get off my lawn. i was at / attacks and i was only getting attacked by deathclaws. i saved my game, made a backup and evicted all but dwellers. i got attacked by raiders times within an hour. (changed the game to windows mode swapped from chrome to the game every min) a pain i know – but i recommend staying around dwellers until you get about raider attacks, then i’m sure you’ll get them all later---blast from the past (collect legendary dwellers)*ok, honesty time here. at about hours in; i was about to give up hope. i had two achievements left, get off my lawn and this one. also, at this point, i didn’t spend a dime on the game. i researched how to get legendary dwellers and, besides earning or from quests, you can get them all from lunch boxes. so i thought to myself “self, you threw down hours of free play, buy a few lunch boxes” – however, $-$ bucks doesn’t get you much, and what lunch boxes it got me… didn’t help. so i “obtained” a save file with lunch boxes and went to town opening- with lunch boxes, clicking to open them for several hours and bam, lunch boxes later, i got the achievement. so this means: (from my own experience) / = approx. .% drop rate per box * = , cards (there are cards per lunch box) / = approx. .% drop rate per cardthe reason i’m saying all this is because if you plan on buying lunch boxes just for this achievement, then you may want to rethink it. i also feel cheap “cheating” to earn achievements, but bethesda has earned enough of my money over the years. they can take one for the team; i sure the hell did with fallout",1

7379,"***editthe last time i touched this garbage was september of last year, and honestly it has changed, for better and for worse, but mostly for worse. there were some balances and some new stuff added (mostly paid things mind you) and i can safely say that this is the last time i'm touching this game. ever.for starters, it feels much more tilted towards paying players rather than regular players. to a very annoying degree, i wouldn't even put it past bethesda/direwolf to have programmed (this is possible, don't even try to deny it) some feature of matching up non paying players with paying players in ranked or otherwise to entice them to pay up for better cards to win with. i abstained from ever buying anything on this game with real money, and i am estatic that i did, because it's not worth it and i don't condone the behaviour bethesda and (possibly) direwolf has been sporting in this game and (in bethesda's case) in general. all in all, this game really isn't anything special, and isn't too great unless you're willing to fork over a few dollars to be able to stand a fighting chance against many of the better decks people will have made from bought decks or will have bought. lastly, theres one thing that seems to need a change yet refuses to change. the accessability of building a guard based deck, guard cards are nice and all, but when you're going up against someone who's deck is primarily guards and buff action cards, then you start to feel like you're smacking your head against a brick wall, hoping to demolish it. i don't have the time or patience or even money to 'git gud' at a game that prioritzes players' money over their skill or competence.---this game has the potential to be fun. it really does, sadly it's not quite at such a potential yet. the ranked leaves much to be desired, the other main features are just pay play up the and most of the time in ranked, you'll end up with someone or ranks above you who has spent bucks on the best cards for their pack, that will decimate you. its sad really, because i kinda enjoy this game. but trust me, ranked can be a struggle, and it's the only mode thats technically free and actually gives rewards like septims and cards (with a rare chance of a pack). the steam trading cards require you to spend real money, something that should be outright banned on steam as it is, but i see they don't quite give enough s to care...regardless, if any devs are reading this (ha, i highly doubt that) you have a great potential to make this better than hearthstone. don't up. just listen to some of the fans, improve what needs improving. i do think that its nice that i can buy certain full decks with septims as oppose to money, thats a very very good thing considering too many games force you to use real money on anything and everything in games nowadays. but i digress, ranked can be fixed a bit, and maybe balance the cards a bit? make many decks less overpowered, and make it more worthwhile to make a custom deck using cards exclusive to bought decks?(updated) so when you get to a milestone in ranked, they made a midway point for you, once you hit said milestone, if you lose a battle, you go down a rank, leading into this really stupid midrank that you can very easily get stuck in if you erratically win and lose. i feel like this is lazy and honestly could be fixed too.(update ) okay, i learned that custom decks are really absurdly broken. so, if you were to make what i call a 'swat team' deck, where you use mainly guard cards and item cards that boost attack and defense, you have a % chance to basically ruin anyone you come across. theres actually several cards that really need to be debuffed, and actually have turned me off of this game. i'll list a few, golden saint (if you know this card, you can see how it can be a match ruiner), ring of imaginary might (couple this with any guard with regenerate and a defense up or two and your opponent is screwed), and royal guard is also a really powerful card. regardless, many of the most powerful cards require you to fork over - bucks of your (or your mother's if you're a young child who pesters their parents for money like a leech sucking blood) money, thus making the game have the illusion of being fair, until you get into the meat (or lack there of) and find a pay win game with many features locked behind paywalls.so, would i recommend this game? no. not even a little bit, hell, even hearthstone is better than this.",0

13428,"honestly it's overall a good game, here are pro's and con's from my perspective.first, the bad stuff.con:. i dont like that fp'ers are a captive audience for advertising pro on the loading screens. i feel pro would sell better if they advertised it less, but then they do need to keep the lights on, i get it. . here's the bull in the china shop. lag. this game is not well optimized and can bring a modern gaming wonder to its knees. pets and lighting, two important things, cause a lot of lag. there could be many optimizations made.. glitches. there are many position-based glitches that are very annoying, closing a door on yourself can send you to the top of the skybox, guaranteed death if you have no pro, and hitting blocks just right can also send you up, in addition to placing blocks over your feet. keepas are very annoying for their high-jump abilities thanks to this. all of these are annoying. also many games have developed a loading glitch where the world stops rendering in front of the player, and if they arent careful, they fall alll the way down and then the game loads but now they are in the corruption layer with no escape. also, as murphy's law dictates, right in front of a thing.. money. hey, i get it, you need money, but some of the micro transactions are a bit much. i think especially on smaller packs of items or outfits or recipes and such, the block/item count needs to be raised for it to be balanced. (edit: it has been raised, so thanks, but i'm leaving this in because it wasn't raised by a ton). lighting. okay guys, heres the issue. lights in this game are way underpowered, and the textures for them dont fit a lot of buildings, or if they do, they are super bulky. i would like to see more lamp and lantern textures.. automation. okay, so ths is coming after having played the game for over a thousand hours, and besides lag, i would have to say, my biggest desire for this game is automation. as of writing this, you can't automate processing or forging. early game, this poses no problem, but late game, when (like me) you have some odd processors to handle the massive capacities your builds need, it can get pretty tedious to put everything in a processor. it would be nice to like have a processor you could wire to a chest and preset to chop slabs, slopes, or rods. same with furnaces. i can take care of capacity, just please please please please please dont make me have to go through every. single. one. of them to process a bunch of stuff. it would be so nice to be able to (late-game, again) pop a bunch of items into a chest and come back later, open the output chest, and have it all done neatly. i would freaking love you guys.yeah i'll shut up now...okay now for the fun stuff.pro:. yeah the ads are annoying, but i do have to say, pro is worth the bucks, so good job on that. . the one glitch i love: the terrible aero system. you guys have a grotequely innaccurate aerodynamic system for the glider, and it's amazing. it allows skilled flyers to gain altitude over time without using boost. its pretty great, i'd honestly be reallyif it got removed. it adds a ton of usefulness to the glider. honestly, i'm rather surprised most people dont know how to utilize this.. the tech. this game has more comprehensive in-depth logic gates and stuff than most minecraft style games, and once you get the hang of it its great. the arc signs are tons of fun. just add more to it and please folks, for the love of god, please stop changing the arc sign sprites.. textures. this game is quite pretty, and besides the above issues, the prettiness is great. they're also fairly clever in marketing certain textures without it being forced. you can buy them, but you are totally fine without them.. rotation. i played some minecraft, and in just a few hours, i instantly missed my precious rotation from this game. sure, its a bit wonky, but it's miles better than trying to stand in all the most awkward places possible just to make a build look how you want it to.. farming. lots of people complain how there is no creative mode, but honestly, this game is far more generous in farming resources than minecraft, the game everyone compares it to. it takes less farming to build more resources, so i like the fact that after you're done with the early game, it kinda settles down to a pleasant middle ground between survival and creative. i can get how it's not for some people, but for me, it's nice. farming feels fairly rewarding, without feeling hollow like creative can, so when you have a hugely massive creation, you can feel proud that you farmed all those resources.. stack size. right alongside farming resources, the new and improved stack size of is sooo much nicer than .not only can you make tons of stuff, you can now hoard it too! i should know, i hoard everything (even pebble's pebbles. i mean seriously, who uses them? but i hoard em anyway. why not? i got the space!) so go nuts.overall, this game basically covers what i originally wanted from minecraft, the ability to build huge stunning creations people appreciate. i enjoy it and hope you do too!",1

10577,"eternal combines the best parts of hearthstone and magic the gathering to create a ccg experience that is similar to both but unlike either. mtg players will recognize mechanics similar to lands, dual lands, instants, five different mana colors, and battle mechanics like trample, deathtouch, lifesteal, first strike, and flying. because this game is digital, it can do things that you could never do with physical mtg cards, like the warcry mechanic that add +/+ to the top unit of your deck when you attack. there are much fewer rng elements here than hearthstone, and some nice of themes to build your deck around like an army of valkyries, a gang of gunslingers, a pack of dniosaurs, or suicidal grenadins.progression feels so much more rewarding than in hearthstone! in addition to daily quests, you also get a free card pack for your first win of the day, and these packs have twelve cards instead of five and include enough crafting materials to make a common or uncommon card of your choice. yes, you get crafting materials in the card packs! you also get gold for every win (not every wins) which can be spent on card packs. there is also a leveling system in place for each of the factions (red, blue, green, black, and white). when you level up in a faction, you get additional rewards like gold or a free pack, and xp is earned based on the decks you play. so focus on one or two colors to level those up faster, or run a rainbow deck (and there are some great rainbow decks) to level up all five evenly.you have the typical pvp modes like casual, ranked, and a draft pick that is extraodinary! after you pay the entry fee, you open a bunch of randomized card packs and then pick and pass to create a pool, and from that pool you create a deck. it's almost exactly like something you'd see at a mtg event. there are also pve modes here. the gauntlet has you fight ai opponents using any custom decks you've created, and forge is like hearthstone's draft pick mode. there are a few campaigns that have a steep entry fee but give you guaranteed rewards.all in all, i really enjoy eternal far more than hearthstone or magic. and oh yeah, there is a mobile app as well, so i can play on the bus to work. i've played a lot of digital card games (hearthstone, gwent, faeria, duelyst, legends) and eternal ranks in my book.",1

2133,"single-handedly redefining a genre is an amazing feat. especially as a fp game i have played path of exile on and off since it first launched on steam. i always could see it's greatness, but there were things putting me off, like the horrible netcode and desyncs. after starting again with patch ., i could not resist recommending this game. to make it brief: it is epic. imagine diablo , but amplified in every way with dozens of systems and mechanics to keep you motivated, while the combat feels as responsive and impactful as diablo story path of exile takes place in a very unique fantasy setting. you as the player get stranded as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast, which is kinda the game-worlds way of sentencing you to death. but you are no normal exile and soon discover, that you are capable of great power by using mystical gemstones. i don't want to go into too much detail, but for an action rpg, especially a fp-arpg, the background is amazingly detailed. the story-telling is somewhat souls-esque, with npcs, item descriptions and randomly spawning audiologs giving information to the player which has to be puzzled together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world. atmosphere & setting building on the mystical background-story the developers have created a dark and grim world for the players to explore. objectively, there is a huge variation between zones and acts. while you start on the rough coast of wraeclast, you soon move into muddy swamps, through dark caverns, fight through jungles, discover old overrun cities and fight in pompous palaces. the variety is excellent and some areas, which lead up to certain bosses, are very rich in atmosphere. on the downside, i feel that the variation, which is definetely there, feels not as distinctive as it could since almost all areas are somewhat dark and gloomy. i get that this is an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that diablo was building, but sometimes i catch myself being bored with the sorroundings although they are, again objectively speaking, mastefully crafted. gameplay on the surface, the gameplay of path of exile is cookie-cutter arpg: run through areas, click monsters to death and get sucked into the addiction of finding better loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s*it out of randomly generated endgame-content. below this surface, there is an unprecedented level of complex systems to keep you occupied. for starters: at the start of your journey, you choose between different classes, but despite genre-convention, your class choice doesn't really lock you into skills and playstyles. since the active skills aren't learnable on a skilltree, like most other arpgs do, you could potentially use every skill the game has to offer with every class you choose at the start. every active skill can be dropped in the form of gems which then have to be socketed in your equipment to be used and also can be leveled to increase their power.so no skill tree you ask? oh boy, there is one, and when it comes to skilltrees, it is the mother of all skilltrees. it is enormous, complex and challenges the player in ways, that no other arpg has challenged you before. mostly offering passive bonuses and playstyle defining key-abilities, you have to carefully think about investing your skillpoints. but there is always a way for you to switch passives, if you feel like you have missplaced some points, which i feel is an excellent compromise between forcing the player to make smart choices, but also giving you the opportunity to correct mistakes, you may have made.currency is also a biiig part of the game and works different to almost any other arpg: instead of gold, you can sell items for different orbs, that you will need for crafting and improving your equipment. these orbs are not only currency between you and the npcs but can also be used to trade with other players. player-trading is vital and the community is very active, so you can always spend your time trading with others to get the gear you desire.what has to be said though is this: path of exile is hard. not only is it hard when it comes to the challenge of beating it's content (and believe me, that in itself is a tremendous challenge), but it also has a steep learning curve for new players. the tutorials they implemented work, but they're in form of texts and the player has to actively read all of the tutorials to understand the mechanics and systems. luckily the community is helpful and there are excellent video guides on youtube to get you started. controls the controls feel tight & responsive in most cases, which is elementary for arpgs. in the past, i always had my problems with poe since i felt that the netcode was bad, that the game had too many lags and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoyed. i am happy to report that things have improved a lot. most of the time, the game feels as direct, impactful and responsive as diablo , which is king in this regard. sometimes, there are lags, but nothing to worry about in the long run. presentation technically, path of exile is good. most textures are crisp, detailed and the animations are fluid and well made. some of the later areas can even be breathtakingly beautiful. but subjectively, i personally don't like the artstyle of the game. it feels to generic, sometimes it even seems to clean, while the envoirements are too static for my taste. i am bored by the constant darkness and the dim lighting. but all of this is subjective and i cannot critize the game for my personal taste. afaik, most people really like the look of the game.when it comes to sound & music, i found path of exile to be surprisingly good. most sound effects are distinct and impactful, while the music plays along nicely, especially in the npc-hubs. replayability & content to sum it up: the content is massive. you have characters, each can be leveled up to , which takes weeks of time to reach. you also can play every character several times with different builds and those builds will have unique playstyles. there are tons and tons of loot, skill-gems, materials and other drops to look for. the path of exile team is also very busy, when it comes to seasons: every new season features a new mechanic, which gets implemented into the game. most new mechanics, that have been implemented in a season, stay in the game to expand the things you encounter. right now, the game offers story-acts, split into two halves, while the second half revisits a lot of the older maps, while also changing a lot and offering up new boss fights. aside from the story you have a s*itload of stuff you can do, so don't worry about content.when it comes to the fp-part of this game, don't worry: it is fair: you don't have to pay for anything. you can play any part of the game, for as much as you want for free. the only thing you can pay for are cosmetics and some improvements to your stash, making collecting and sortings items easier for you. while i find the prices for the skins, pets and stash improvements to be quite steep, i applaud the developers for this system, which is so fair, that i spent money on their shop just to show gratitude. tl;dr prostight, responsive controls...giving a visceral and satisfying combat feelingmassive content with potentially hundreds of hours of fun to be hadincredibly complexexcellent fp-systemconssubjectively dreary visuals, while technically soundsteep learning curve for new playershardcore can be frustrating, since damage can spike out of nowhere and kill you in an instant. recommendation?

939,"i was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):my opinion: solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad. if played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. if you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. the devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game. the negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. but really my negatives are limited to that and i do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions. i suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. but when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. a lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. if anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. if i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what i see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. this isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect. since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.microtransactions: limited to skins essentially, you can't simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. there is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1

15708,"after giving this game a pretty serious bit of time over the last month i have to sadly give it a thumbs down as a pc game. now as for on mobile devices id say its standard play with a solid art style. but for those of us on pcs here on steam as maybe a pure ftp game its an ok casual time waster.however the game is thick with micro transactions. it costs to skip many hour long( sometimes day long) crafting times.it costs for many cosmetic rewards you still have to first earn the right to use via game play. now the company wanting money is not some sin. but consider this. for the ultimate guardian pack they want bucks. you get a few unique cosmetics, some extra storage a butt load of their dragon crystal points that still wont get you more then a few of the pricier point only in game items.now consider a classic but high quality pay once play forever fully finished mmo like guild wars. for bucks you get the classic campaign trilolgy and for another the eye of the north expansion. while old gw is far from dated. the graphics are still eye catchingly lovely, and easily destroy the cartoon style of this game. game play wise, sure gw does especially during its lowbie levels use common collect and fetch quest systems, but also has rich virbant stories, and many quests that demand the use of ones brain or at least reading the comprehensive wiki to develop winning strategies.while i can see dabbling in this game from time to time, and using it as a chat room game, the moment i start thinking of spending a cent it loses out to many other games. many of which i can get many hours of play in for a much more modest price.sadly this company seems more about drawing in a fan base that they can sell silly rl merchendise like shirts, novelty hats, and primitive physical calenders all with in game cosmetic items as part of the deal, to make their money. it feels like they are wasting alot of their development energy on limited time events, exclusive cosmetics that require buying some item that will act as free advertisment for them, and very little really spent on content or qol improvments.so while if i could id rate it as an ok entry into mobile games, for steam pc gamers we just have too many better options to waste time or risk money on an eag that shows little real potential to rival even old pc mmo like classic guild wars.soif your looking for a pure ftp with no intent to spend then sure give it some time waster hours, otherwise invest your time and especially your money in something worthy of it.",0

4195,"i thoroughly enjoyed this game when first installed, mostly due to nostalgia and my enjoyment of tcgs. that being said, many, many cards from the series are not included. no pot of greed, no monster reborn, etc. the ai is highly unbalanced. initially, the computer opponents practically hand you victory after victory. eventually, the ai will reach such a level that only very specific decks will allow you the chance to win. the game will repeatedly mention there is no such thing as a correct deck, however, in this game, that is definitely not true. i got to a point where i won maybe out of games, and if you want anything for the loss, you have to stick it out through the extra five minutes of the ai making pointless moves to flaunt its power while you sit there just waiting to die so you can go on to the next losing match. you can always play against easy opponents at any time, however, you have to earn keys, since they cost keys to play. great time waster for a week or so, but then this game becomes very tedious. i will also mention that in the hours logged into this game, i earned enough gems to open just shy of card packs. i mention this merely so you can have an idea of how many cards i had, and so that you know i had many choices in strategy before i just decided to call it quits and uninstall.",0

8885,"note: to see this review in its true form go to: is massive multiplayer, free-roam, and free play. the gameplay of planetside varies. sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas. other times massive armies will attack for a large command post. now, because planetside is a free to play game you might be wondering if the paying players get an advantage. the answer would yes and no. yes because paying players can get guns,armor, and upgrades faster, no because they don't get any paid-only weapons. for example they can't drop $/$ and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them.players in planetside can choose from six classes. light assault,heavy assault,combat medic,sniper,engineer, and mech suit. planetside is meant to be a tactics game, and i've had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit. in planetside instead of clans you have outfits. now you can join a platoon without being in that outfit, but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online.visual-wise planetside is great, textures are high-res, shadows are soft and lighting is done just right. the best part is that it doesn't take too much gpu or cpu power. the not so great part is that it only runs in -bit mode. gameplay takes part on three massive open-world continents on the world auraxis. the three continents you fight on are indar,esamir, and amerish. each map has its own theme. one is icy and cold, another is warm and wet, and the last is a dry arid wasteland. the servers are normally lag-free, i've played at least hours and i can only remember lagging out four times, and that was when i was in a + person battle. one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other leveled up players. but this just means the noobs should team up with the veterans and provide support, like a playing as a sniper,medic, or engineer. another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base, and that is that most players don't want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in call of duty shooting people in little killing sprees. thats not how this game works. and if you try to play it like call of duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win.the only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line, maybe a co-op campaign. it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the devs put into the factions and areas. i guess that's asking too much for a mmo. anyways, check planetside out, its free,its fun, and its on steam.",1

16616,"the game in general is really fun, and it captures the spirit of bloons wonderfully.unfortunately it's overshadowed by the absolute terrible balancing the game has.the game has two main modes, attack mode or defense mode. attack mode allows you to send bloons at your foe for money, and you will receive increased money per turn. defense mode is just you going head to head with someone without sending the bloons.attack mode is probably most popular, and the best mode in my opinion. it's really great to select your towers for the game and plan out what you'll do, and send certain bloons at your enemy depending on the towers they have.you can only choose types of bloons, and you can get a random one for energy, this isn't too bad, but it does often feel like you don't quite have enough bloons to cover all your bases.there are two big issues in my eyes with attack mode. it's simply too easy to place one or two towers that can deal with the easy bloons at the start, and save up the large amount of money to get the massive red blimp. since this would still be relatively close to the start of the game, there's no way you can defend against this and it's normally a gameover.it's not always even a red bloon, people can just flood you with a ton of bloons or even just higher level bloons. you can defend against this more or less, but depending on your setup it can easily overwhelm you. this also leads to having to be very specific you have bloons to defend against these, since you're only allowed - towers.the next big issue i see with attack mode is directly from the game. once you get to around round they start sending an insane amount of powerful bloons at you. this wouldn't be a problem if you actually had the finances, map space, or upgrades to actually deal with them; but more often than not you just don't.defense mode is just laughable. in attack mode you start off with making $ after some amount of seconds; defense mode only gives you $ to start with. that wouldn't be a problem if they adjusted the tower cost or the bloon difficulty. but it's exactly the same patterns as attack mode. there are far too many bloons for the speed at which you can upgrade your bloons. you can buy money-per-turn upgrades, but the lowest tier gives you an extra $ per turn for $. that's a crazy amount of money when you're only getting $ each time.besides the two game modes there are lots of different events, some of which are pay-to-play. they allow you to play special events once per day, or you can get a membership to play it all the time. you also do not have access to all towers and tower upgrades at the start. you unlock the ability to purchase them by winning games; you purchase them with coins in game which you can get either by paying with real money or various random methods in game.this game is super great for playing with friends, though unless you play against random people you won't have any towers or upgrades aside from the base ones you start out with.it's just super frustrating to play, mainly because of the terrible balancing. it's free, so i'd recommend trying it out for yourself and see what you think; but as a good game i cannot really recommend it.",0

7515,"here's the short of it.was (in some aspects still is) a good game with a lot of ways to kill time with friends, but now its all about the $$$. oh, you are new? you, pay me!here's the long.the reason i cannot reccomend it anymore (mostly for new players) is because of changes made to the game around the time of this review. classes in game can no longer be unocked with cubits (currency earned from grinding). instead classes must be purchased with money, which is going to affect new players the most since they will be stuck playing out as a single class, which for their sake i hope they chose wisely. mabey if they like the game enough they will buy a new class, but it will be hard to enjoy a game where you are stuck using something you regret choosing, no? if you have enough in game resources, you can buy a class coin (unlocks one character) for a hefty fee from another player. new players wont be able to afford these class coins. another thing that has changed is the acquisition of dragons. the update was supposed to make getting a dragon easier, lies. it is now more difficult to get a dragon as they must be crafted with a hefty(er) amount of resources, unless you would like to pay money to make things feasible. i understand that running a fp online game takes money, what i cannot stand is when corporate does not come out with the truth behind decisions. if a game cannot sustain itself with its current marketing structure, just say so and explain that this is the reason new financial implementations are being added. do not decorate the playerbase with colorful rhetoric and dry pr statements saying this is to make things better for you! doing this makes people look like greedy parasites with only financial gain in mind *cough* starts with t and ends in n *cough*, and i for one do not wish to give my money to such people. pay to support good people and the good work they do? yes, absolutely. line their pockets with the scalps of hillas? no!if you want to try this game, look up each class and determine which one you will enjoy playing as the most. just be aware that this game just got very grindy in two main aspects, and is likely to get even more so in the future. avarem be praised! (he does the in game announcements, hence the skygod title others and i have given him) screw the devsedit: well... look what the game has come to. i warned the playerbase the moneygrabbing would get worse, and they said no, this is just to support the game and this game takes money to run. well i'm fairly certain those players have since said it and abandoned the game as i did so long ago.",0

13470,"so where to begin, this game is good and has some good concepts and designs. the graphics are very visually pleasing and the game runs smooth, minus some rendering issues now and then. there is a good baseline of items that can be used, however apart from the blocks, all the items can be aquired fairly quickly. i have played this game for about hours in total and pretty much have every item, minus all block colours and combinations. which really isnt long time get to end game items.as this game will be closely compared to minecraft, for obvious reasons. although the content is lacking in creativerse in time they would be able to compete with them, such as a redstone equivalent.the biggest problem with this game is the fact that blocks can take forever to create, using forging rather than crafting. as this game has some very visually pleasuring content for structures, this should be addressed so people can come into the game and just 'create', something like a creative-mode, would suit this game very well.overall the way the game stands i would give this game a ./ and would recommend it to someone who would like a change from minecraft.",1

14940,me and my younger brother signifigantly played this game for quite some years even before it showed up on steam and have seen its many itterations. the hours on steam are only a fraction of what we have played overall. now i myself saw robocraft going down even before this loot crate system which is to say the least an absolute travesty for this kind of game but a the key sign that the company has lost its orginal vision for money. while yes for new comers this may seem like an awesome game but it is not an excuse for them shafting veteran players who have put countless hours (even though steam counts them anyway) into a game they whole heartedly enjoyed. the hundreds if not thousand plus hours we had played together can now be thrown aside by a wallet transaction then what was even the point? beta is beta or in this case alpha applys only to games that do not have microtranactions. we have spent plenty of money ourselves on this game but now our compensation is just insulting and then finding a game even less free than before. if you want a game right now that can scratch the itch that robocraft use to or what you would want to i reccomend crossout without any doubt. better to pay for a closed beta than an open alpha with that spark that robocraft use to have. right now stay away from this money grab.,0

9784,"ive been playing this game off and on for years, getting bored with some characters i make. for a free to play i highly recommend this game. unlike the more popular games like wow, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. you actually have to move and do combos. i will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. i think out of burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. the pvp is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. people also have crappy internet who pvp so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks.but still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.",1

7699,"this is my first time reviewing a game and the only reason i am doing this is because many mmo's on steam are very simular and most of the time, badly produced and executed but this game is an exception on that stereotype, here's why:the game is really fun and surprises you in some categories, the combat is surprisingly fun even though im just holding down a button and using my special moves from time to time.the building is super in depth but it may not look like it at the beggining, there are insane ammounts of decorative blocks and objects to place in your clubworld/cornerstonethe levelling system is what you would expect, its quite slow but if you dont mind spending some time into the game to level.here's where it gets complicated, at the start, the levelling is super fast and fun however, i found my self spending a few hours just clearing dungeons from time to time and started getting repetetive, but where i am now is the reason i had to write this review, i wont spoil it but you get some cool stuff and you no longer are clearing dungeons to level, you always have your own personal goal to do and have a normal goal too. this made it so i was distracted from the tideous parts of the game and now focused on the personal quests and goals and awesome parts of the game. this has easily become my most played and loved game on my steam library, i highly suggest this if your into mmo's.",1

3806,"the short answer is, it's holding up very well. the core action pits two teams of players against each other in a battle to capture points, move a cart, or steal a briefcase. the objective is always very straightforward; it's the interplay between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. the speedy scout, the militant heavy, the diligent engineer, the conniving medic, the pesky sniper, the sneaky spy, the feisty pyro, the explosive soldier, and the even-more-explosive demoman all have unique weapons, attributes, and abilities that complement each other and clash in myriad ways. encounters can vary widely depending on the match type and the makeup of each team, and this unpredictability is crucial to tf's long-standing appeal.when you come out of the gate as a heavy with a medic in tow, you're a formidable offensive force, but if a spy loops around to backstab the medic and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come undone in a matter of seconds. snipers can cover expected enemy paths, but rocket-jumping soldiers have a knack for finding alternative routes and raining explosive death from above. you may think you have a comparatively weak scout dead to rights, only to be stunned by a baseball and beaten to death. as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a freeze-frame of your gleeful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer variety of ways you can meet an untimely demise. and the humorous quips, ridiculous outfits, and histrionic announcer help cultivate this lighthearted tone.of course, this core dynamic has persisted for most of tf's life span, so if you stopped playing it a few years ago and come back for a few matches, you'll find things are very familiar. learning the ropes and getting the hang of your chosen role is still a gratifying experience, and mastering advanced techniques doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach combat. keeping your options open is still valuable too, because being flexible with your choice of character can help you avoid ending up on a catastrophically imbalanced squad. it is team fortress, after all.but though there is much that has remained constant about the core game, there have been some notable changes over the years, as well as regular infusions of new weapons and items. of the hundreds of things available in the online store, some can be unlocked through play, while others must be purchased with actual money. from small doodads that cost less than a dollar to massive bundles that cost hundreds, there's a wide range of ways to customize your experience.many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic. you can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up like a character from adult swim or don spooky seasonal garb that you can wear only during halloween or a full moon. even if you don't fancy shelling out for any of this stuff, it's fun to see some visual variety as you try to light your opponents on fire.other weapons have more of an impact, like the ones that give your character a new chargeable and expendable power. the scout can build hype, which turns his usual double jump into a triple, quadruple, or quintuple jump, and the soldier can build rage, which allows him to rally his nearby teammates to do extra damage. skills like these have more of a meaningful impact on the action, bringing something new to the table that your enemies must contend with. and then there are the totally out-there loadouts, like the one that turns the grenade-launching demoman into an extra from the movie braveheart.in addition to the cosmetic options, there are a lot of weapons and items that offer small buffs or subtle tweaks to your attributes. depending on which healing gun the medic equips, for example, he can imbue himself and his targeted ally with extra damage resistance or enable himself to match the speed of his target. differences like these don't do much to change the core action, but they do give experienced players substantial room for strategic variation.these options broaden the field of viable strategies, which helps keep combat lively and varied. and fortunately, none of the purchasable weapons or items tip the scales unfairly towards those willing to pay. buffs and bonuses usually come with caveats, and the weapons that bestow new abilities are usually unlocked for free. for this review, i spent some money on goofy hats and some of the stranger weaponry on offer, like the pyro's flamethrower that actually shoots bubbles and rainbows. it was fun to play with the new gear, but i still found myself switching my loadout between free and paid weapons regularly to adapt to the match situation.very very fun game, i highly suggest everyone come try it! after all, it's free!",1

4331,"this is, first and foremost, a mobile game ported to steam. is that a bad thing? maybe. the thing is that how much you spend is up to you, but if you want to get your favorite individual cards, you better hope they are rare or normal, and not put in the abritrary packs/rewards. while the game gives free currency to get packs frequently, it only happens with events that give it away in big lumps, else you're getting trickles of gems.second, the game plays like pre-ds era yu-gi-oh, with a smaller field to make games faster. this is both a strength and weekness for the game, as while this brings in vets of the game, it can turn away more meta players/players who's favorite card/archtype is not in the game.third, this game is very competitive at times, and trys to subtlely nudge you into paying with the vegabond duelest, who are just ghosts of high ranked pvp players, who also duel with sometimes bs modifiers like having a full field or having only cards in your hand. add those modifiers with a good deck and the odds are so stacked against you at times it's like an whale versus a mouse.sure, you can harp on me saying i only have < hrs on the game, but it's a game that discurages playing for long without paying. and while i don't mind having cards from post-gx, if you're gonna port an archtype, port an archtype that fits within classic/gx era, not archtypes that have good syncros/xyz/pendulum monsters.",0

7142,"its a great card game, they put a suprisingly large amount of effort into polishing and balancing this. suprising because i figured this was just an attempt to capitalize off of the growing ccg fanbase, while also expanding the elder scrolls universe. bethesda has been diversifying the elder scrolls series as of late, in what seems like attempts to monopolize the series in the video game world. elder scrolls online treaded into the mmo world, and now this treading into the more casual game world. im not really sure how i feel about it yet, but one thing i do know, they cant seem to make a great elder scroll game that isnt an open world rpg. just like eso, this game misses its mark, and falls short of being noteable in any way. that doesnt mean it isnt fun, and its definitely a way to kill half an hour or so. sadly this game only makes me want to play skyrim again, and quite simply, it does not scratch that itch. the game plays similar to magic: the gathering, but its card graphics are nowhere near as cool looking. the cards are generally lackluster and unimpressive, i was hoping they would utilize some visually appealing art style, but instead its just a generic western fantasy style. magic has a more gothic and visceral style, where es legends has a hokey cartoon style. there are sound effects when cards are used, which is cool until about minutes into the game, when the cards spout out the same lines repeatedly. a daedric cultist card will say a korny line like, for the queen of darkness, every time it attacks. now imagine there are four daedric cultist cards on the table, and a dozen turns left in the game, you will hear for the queen of darkness literally times, over and over, until you just mute the game altogether. that was my experience, and sadly i now play the game on mute, which should never have to be done. overall the game is just ok, but since its free its almost impossible for me to not recommend the game. because of this i imagine the steam rating will stay really high, you should note that its not indicative of the quality of the game, because in my opinion the game is really not great, its just ok. not even the subject matter of es can save this one, and to be honest this game has nothing on hearthstone or other more well established card games. despite that there is literally no reason not to give it a try, considering its free. /",1

4800,"i have played this gem of a game a total of hours before it was available on steam and i could start playing it on my steam account.i started playing smite in open beta. i even had a closed beta key, but stupid me didn't start playing smite back then because the premise of a moba sounded boring. i had no idea. well, smite could be called the non-boring moba.this is a full action game you play in rd person, so you can enjoy the beautiful levels and the even more beautiful ability effects from a decent angle of view. even better is you can enjoy the look of the gods and their many awesome skins from up close.the gameplay doesn't lack either. once you know how to upgrade abilities and when to purchase which item, casual play (which i prefer, but smite has a huge competitive scene with leagues etc if you prefer that) is a lot of fun and will entertain you for many hours, especially because you can choose from many different gods to play, as well as a good selection of different game modes.gods? yes, you play gods. this game doesn't feature unknown fantasy characters with a lame backstory, instead you play one of currently (january ) gods (and some mythical demons and monsters), like thor, freya, athena, ares, isis, osiris, hercules, mercury, kali, rama, kukulkan, chaac, sun wukong, chang'e and, recently (january ) introduced, amaterasu as first goddess of the japanese pantheon.it is likely that more pantheons will be added in the future.the fact that you are an actual god in a battle for the heavens makes this game feel more epic than other mobas, which is supported by the scenery, items and music in the game.this is a free to play game which has an acceptable in-game economy. there is no pay to win at all in this game, everything you buy for real money is cosmetic, from avatars, skins, voice packs to music or announcer packs. all gods can be unlocked by playing other gods (you get a selection of gods for free when starting the game), and many skins and other items can be unlocked by playing as well.the only thing you could say against smite is that a game can swing to one side a little too quickly. however, even in the smite world championship we have seen interesting turns in a game, so the imbalance is perfectly acceptable.i can recommend this game even to people who think mobas are boring. you will probably be disabused of this notion like me.",1

(esl is in no way a clone of hearthstone)regarding the pw aspect that other reviews are complaining about, you can get a near complete collection with a couple of months invested into the game without spending a dime. it will require some grinding but that is expected in any free game.

15046,"after playing this game for over hours and progressing through (almost ) tiers, i think i'm qualified to write a good, informed review. the concept of this game is to build a functioning robot (it isn't really a robot due to the fact that you have a pilot seat, but that's beside the point) out of the parts they give you, then take this robot into battles. the more you fight with your robot, the more currency you earn (represented by rp) along with tech points, which are used to unlock new parts, which are then bought with rp. you must also use rp to repair your bot if it is damaged in battle, and the repair costs varry depending on just how damaged your bot was. currently, there is only one gamemode in which you must capture the opponent's base before they capture yours. so, if you're a fan of varrying gamemodes i can't really recommend this to you...yet. one major thing that i feel like i should address is that this game does include microtransactions. but, before you hear that word and automatically deny the existance of the game, the game is not pay to win in the way that you would be able to notice it while playing a match, and arguably not pay to win at all. the reason for this is that the game works by matching up your bot with other bots which fit in your tier (i saw one of the reviews not recommending the game complaining that they are constantly matched with players in tiers higher then themselves, but i have never had that experience in over hours of gameplay). due to this system, someone who buys the best parts in the game is going to be automatically moved into the highest tier in the game, where they will still not gain an advantage over other players. if anything, those who pay for parts would have a disadvantage due to the fact that they are not as experienced in building their robots or fighting with them. building off of my last sentence, the way you build your robot is very important. someone with the lowest avaliable items in a tier with a well designed bot could still defeat someone with the highest weapons in the tier with a badly-designed bot.another major aspect of this game is progression through levels. the only time this game gives me the feeling of grinding is after i've maxed out my robot for the tier i'm in but i don't quite want to step up to the next tier yet, which is really only a limit i put on myself. there is rarely a time (in the first tiers anyway, i haven't progressed to the tiers above so i can't speak for those yet) when you get back from a battle and can't afford to upgrade your robot in a at least a minor way, such as upgrading a few sheets of armor. due to this constant ability to upgrade at least something, i never really feel like i'm grinding away at the next level, but rather slowly progressing through the level towards the next one, something i really enjoy. all in all, robocraft is a game with a great premise, currently limited gameplay elements (in terms of gamemodes) and a few glitches, but those are to be expected in early access games. i would recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to be able to build and use the vehicle you take into battle and don't mind the fact that there is curently only one gamemode. to those who are turned away by that fact, there are still maps which provide areas for using different strategies with different robots, adding some sort of variety into the gamemodes. even if that still doesn't seem like enough of a redeeming factor, just try it anyway, as the worst that can happen if you end up absolutely hating it is that it took up some space on your computer and some of your time.",1

2310,"if you like diablo-likes, this one is free, and really good, so you should probably play it.don't worry too much about the freeplay aspect. it's all cosmetics, and additional tabs for your stash (the place in town where you store items, if you're unfamiliar) and those stash tabs are cheap, and you probably won't even need more than what they give you anytime soon.it does a few interesting, different things from your typical diablo-like.. for the most part, you'll feel like you're playing diablo or grim dawn (atmosphere and much of the gameplay), or torchlight (gameplay). some of those different, interesting things are as follows:- the active skill system, which is similar to how materia works in final fantasy .. your equipment has sockets on it, and you fit your skill gems into those sockets. if there are link sockets, you can place 'support' gems in there and give the main skill additional effects, such as added [element] damage, piercing, turning that skill into a trap that you throw on the ground instead of one that you actively cast, etc.. it's a very neat way to help people build a character's skill set to make it their own, loads of possibilities.- the passives system, similar to final fantasy 's sphere grid (does anyone else get the feeling that the devs have played a lot of ps/-era final fantasy?). again, if you're unfamiliar, i'll try to explain. every character class starts out somewhere on this large kinda boardgame-like matrix on the passive skill window. this screen is full of these little nodes, connected by paths. when you level up, or complete certain quests and get a skill book, you get a point to unlock a node.each node grants something like more strength, intelligence, dexterity, health, mana, mana regeneration, attack speed, etc... there are also big nodes that usually grant several benefits at once, and/or a passive skill. you have to follow the branching paths from node to node around the board toward ones that you want to get. you can even choose to build your path toward other parts of the board if you want some of the benefits of another character class (one of the character classes that you don't have access to early on starts smack-dab in the middle of the board, allowing them to branch out toward anything they desire.)- the bartering system.. this one's a little weird, but it's a pretty neat idea. basically, there is no 'gold' in this game, but there are certain items in the world that both serve a practical purpose, and are used as currency to trade with npc vendors. for example, a scroll of wisdom is used to identify your special items, but it's also a form of currency. these items are found in their whole form, and in fragmented form (the fragments automatically become a whole when you have enough of them). when you sell stuff, you get these currency items (or at least fragments of them) instead of money, when you buy stuff, you spend them. want that frostbolt skill gem? it'll cost you one full scroll of wisdom.anyway, if you like this type of game, there's really no reason not to try it. it's freeplay done right, because you can have a full, fun experience without spending a dime of real money... or you can deck yourself out in purple flaming armor, fairy wings, and glowing footprints. that's up to you.",1

11127,"eternal is a card game with a playstyle that's modeled after magic: the gathering, and a card collection style modeled after hearthstone (but better!). it is completely free to play, with the helpful but unnecessary option of spending money on drafts or packs to help buoy your early game card collection. you get to keep all the cards you draft, and you also get a decent amount of shiftstone (the card-crafting currency) for each pack you open. the game is so free to play that i was compelled to basically donate to them so i could have an uninhibited play experience.this game is for all the people who enjoy playing magic, but have issues with the magic online program for any of the possible reasons. all i wanted to do with magic was just jam games for free and against quality opponents. third party software did not quite scratch that itch, so when i saw eternal was released i jumped on board and have really taken to it. this is perhaps eternal's greatest strength - the bingeability of the game - yet it can also be its greatest weakness. because people can just queue up indiscriminately, they play a lot more games than normal, and the dreaded variance sucks argument comes to a head more often, because you literally are more likely to be screwed by variance when you're increasing your number of games played. if you like to complain about variance, honestly, stop playing all card games, because variance is literally what makes card games fun. that or learn to accept your lord and savior variance mcgee into your life and keep a lingering smile on your face as the game engine hands you an unwinnable hand.the game design has done a phenomenal job with the first set, with an unbelievable number of playable archetypes in constructed mode. it won't all be tier one, but with as wildly as the meta shifts in this game, it can be fun to find that one random deck you played months ago which you just realized has a strong matchup against the current meta. some decks will seemingly never die, but dire wolf digital has shown a willingness to step in and nerf cards it sees as problems, while also buffing a few underutilized cards a bit more rarely. gone for me are the days of learning the combat tricks in each color, which was a very fun process to learn much like a new magic draft format, but a new player will certainly delight in learning how to play around the opponent's tricks. until a new eternal set comes out, the intellectual enjoyment on my end predominantly comes from attacking the meta in a favorable manner.i've really enjoyed the product that dire wolf digital has put out, and i think it has a lot of portability over from any other popular card game a new player might be more familiar with. if you're new to card games, there will obviously be a bit more of a learning curve, but hey, this is completely free - might as well try it out!",1

11960,"i'll echo what many others are saying. no, just no. i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an mmo. but given that bless has been an ongoing project since and released in regions prior to steam. there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years. trust me, save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first. ~million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west...promotion/marketing- they advertised this game as local, optimized and new combat mechanism. upon -days early (of early) release this is not the case by a long shot. they marketed to your hype and released none of it. matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas. i get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better. optimzation is just not there...you have to edit your own ini files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine /dx...yeah, a dinosaur. new combat! after many complained about the new combat beign removed (except for zerkers) to polish it more...this...this is not beign transparent after happily stealing dlc money. to make it clear, if they said it in advance, many wouldve been ok in waiting. emmisary event-was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release. emmisaries were youtubers to try/represent or even help hype the game. many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs. apparently some drama went down with them too. needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status. early day launch- needless to say that it was a waste of time. one thing is to wait in queue, another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line-to-wait. which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option. that's ish issues. as of this post, its still iffy, believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation. collectors edition-skin/items are all character bound. no way to move them, no way to given them to an alt. with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join, good luck. your pack just got wasted. am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason. also the lumena in-game currency was character bound, they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more. problem here is, they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt...see a trend? in game they warn you its non-refundable! yeah right, people got their money back. nice try.servers- they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time. am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen. so while opening new ones are nice, it splits up pre-made guilds and your precious already burned founders items. poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here. planning of only server vs oceanic, south america, north america, carribean...get the point?roadmap- they have a vague one laid out. most of it is the same from the other regions. but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time. therefore many of earlier region content was striped away. here's the thing, when you meet a person and give that first handshake, that first introduction, it says alot about who you are. neowiz...who are you becoming? neowiz-overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work. do you know what they did differently? open forums, discussions, podcasts, whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with...transparency. warframe and ff are to name a few here. you have been hearing feedback, yes, but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you. come out of that closet, face us more often and get that feedback and just talk...talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship. also, lets say your afraid, you dont want to face an audience, then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with.in short, i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you (neowiz) make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention. at that point, what happens to you?should you prove to turn this around and do better, then ill update my review. just no until then, moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a non-refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried.original post may th.edit and follow up /hmmm where to start. i still would'nt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone. make your own informed decision for what $-$ is worth to you. soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the game's release. from there a few patches, that as i mentioned above, catered to whomever yells the loudest. some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf. not to mention that each patch note doesnt include full disclosure still. for example, first two dungeons used to drop gear, guaranteed, each boss. now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have rng of a drop rate for rng of it beign of your class. events! boy are they throwing events left and right. the last gather/crafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or alt-bank. content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible. i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised. dx was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it. further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above. dupe items scandal. it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed. it demonstrates a rolled back build, further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content. not a full rework. ff went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell. as for those involved in the duping, few days ban and items were kept. so they say. apparently they are listening to feeback through their discord and with some emissaries. i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways. performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within weeks. perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions. performance, performance, ~ million later, perfomance...they already stole your money (and mine) with lack of transparency. whats a few please wait, more soon to make you more gullible?sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience (twitter, reddit). the fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could -shot things. now that adjustments make sense, no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo/links system works. its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down, read, practice. but they seem addicted to preference already.latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition. they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound. this on its own is unnecessary to founders. gold is account bound and am willing to bet that's an issue on the code, unintended. yet the in-game dollar-currency, lumina is not.",0

3087,"tl:dr; great game being tarnished by bad development practices (fpe/parts debacle as of late is a good example of it)to start, this game is fantastic. currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat, and ships/helicopters entering closed beta testing. no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone (arcade for 'casuals' and realistic battles for more 'hardcore' players)engine is utterly fantastic for any game, moreso a fp game. absolutely amazing performance on any system, can almost run on your microwave, while having great graphics on the highest settings. only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the config file but it's pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally isn't neccesary. i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is, in my opinion, one of the best fp games on the market. but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others, even if i continue to play the game.why? because gaijinthey have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up, and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them. outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle, such as the ru-. they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with ge purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it. special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection (fp), which parts are needed to repair your tank after it's damaged (which happens alot) and fp is needed to put out fires. these parts can each take - battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock.for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome. a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for gameplay and grinding were mentioned, and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind. this video then, unsurprisingly, received ~k downvotes versus ~k upvotes. comment section filled with people calling out gaijin and saying parts/fp should be free and not ground out for.then anywhere it removing the grind for parts/fp on a gaijin operated platform the discussion is censored. this parts/fp isn't the first nor last time gaijin perform a practice like this. i can not recommend people who haven't played this game to do so, you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into gameplay hampered by greedy practicesif gaijin ever turn this around, starting by somehow reducing/removing the parts/fp grind then i will change the reccomendation to a yes",0

14660,"sigh, how would i be able to explain how broken robocraft has become?(akward pause)well let's start with the pros:*based off center of math and science*player made robots*community factory to sell copys of your robots*actual weight to blocksnow on with the cons*there are a lot of cons, but here's one:almost everythinglet me explain. i have played this game for so long and i'm dissapointed about how much of a mess robocraft has become. i'm sorry to say but, i don't like it anymore. there are constant updates so that robot you just finished making, the next day, a update comes out and guess what, that robot you spent five hours working on renders useless. i created my bot many years ago and yet, i didn't even think about what i was building. it was a burger colored caterpillar, i slapped some guns on it, gave it some wings and bam, called it a robot.but there is something a bit worse now: balance. the game supposedly says: please wait while we match you fairly with other players. that is a straight up lie. you could create some high tech areoflak cannon bomber and be matched with new players. it's super unfair and it drives away players. freejam, get yourself together and bring back tiers!ever since freejam introduced the community factory, it has been a complete flop for me. it meant the richer players could make their robots have a star combat rating and make them even richer, while those with limited funds, are stuck with the lower star robots, making little to no robits off their robots. guess what the first thing you look for when you go to the community factory, a good robot. so robocraft shows almost only star combat rated robots. and only the rich can buy them, leave the less rich to have to dig deep to just find a cheap, decent, robot.all these robots are being sold for over k robits! how are you supposed to make that much? it seems the only way is to either churn out money for that robot, or simply play match, after match, after match. clan seasons are my main revenue of robits now. your only choice to get that much is to either play for crates and hope you get good stuff to sell in the recycle, or you have to cough up them dolla dolla bills to buy a ship full of platinum crates and sell everything you get from those crates.i can't reccommend this game until it's more balanced and gives robits whether or not you win or lose a match. seriously. hey, new players, keep in mind, rail and plasma for da win.",0

(i did count people in main city last night, while there was - people on server physis.leveling experience is so selfrepeating and mind numbing, that if you made an mistake and leveled up in another server because of server lock, you definetly don't wanna repeat that process again and level up nd character in another server, just to save couple days of your life and your mental health. most likely missing all of it's endgame content. we got patch, v bg (you only can queue specific timeframes x hour per day, and on dead server you have to be very lucky to get queue pop before timeframe closes. (basically you get battlegrounds in a day, if you want to put alarm for all those timewindows when queue is possible and get in to bg before it closes) it got ruined day after by placing one shotting pve mobs in there, and all your runes in your gear break if you die in pve, so... who the f got the idea to do so.item duplication bug at launch (they told the duped items are removed) we have a lot of proof those aren't. currently a bug where you can do insane amounts of money just by running a circle and pressing button.anyways, dev's have been trying hard and been giving us a lot fix patches during the first week from launch. apparently those seems most likely to be randomly tweaked parameters and completely untested before pushing those to official servers. some of those been good, some of those changes mess up the game even more.from many places i hear; all those negative reviews are from players under hours in game, they can't tell truth and just want to bash the game;i took week, put in hours, and i don't see any wrong in those negative reviews. some people just recognize a cash grab/too broken game faster than the others.refundtrain is far gone already, so don't take risk.honest review from somebody, who does put + hours every day on mmorpg s: /update: they are about to do server merge, for those who had been forced to dead servers and later on leveled another faction character in other server, sadly they will disable another faction chars instead of giving us a possibility to faction change.don't buy, it's a cashgrab!! don't buy, it's a cashgrab!! don't buy, it's a cashgrab!!",0

17420,"i purchased this game back and and only played the day free trial but didnt feel like it was worth the subscription fee at the time as i probably didnt put enough time into. when everquest extended came out i downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as i just couldnt get into it.finally i decided to play it again now that it was free to play. fist i downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what i was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. when i noticed it was on steam i reinstalled it on here and iv been playing non stop eversince. one of the huge perks i found as i was playing was i had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, station cash i didnt know i had and tons and tons of other bonuses i had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on . this really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what i could do in the game. especially with housing.graphics:this is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. it all just rolls out to look so good for its age. there are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec. in some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.gameplay:iv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. i dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as i did with this game; despite me not giving it the chance in the first place. im still not even at the level cap of ... wait i read they raised it to hahaha. thats pretty awesome in itself to me because it means i still have a ton of content to buzz through plus the latest expansion pack. so far as of this review im level and i dont even really feel the game is a grind. it just leaves me wanting to play more.the questing type for the most part is standard kill so and so or get me this many of this thing but it does thow in some quests where unique items are given to you and that item is used to summon a boss for instance or special goggles to help you find clues. even though it has so many of the standard quests i actually prefer them over the other quests wheree the special items are required. there usually less tetius and go quicker and this results in faster xp and gold and sickquest item rewards. this being said i still love the bit of variety it does have and it keeps me wanting more. this game has made me fall in love with running dungeons. in the guildwars games dungeons were always pretty fun with friends or a good group but they generally require you to wait around for a group or use there sickdungeon finder to get a group together. this is all well and sweet and pretty flawless for guildwars but i like how i can freely run a dungeon alone or with a group here in everquest . it just depends on your level and ability. theres the flipside to that. you can also run the dungeons with people when your at a lower level or whatever so that option is obviously still there i guess the problem with it is though, is finding a group of people around who want to help you and not just clear the whole place out a few seconds before you. i tuely feel that there dungeon matchmaking needs to be improved because i find it confusing asor not very functional at the time. it would be amazing if they incorperated a mega server type idea like guildwars as that solution in my opinion is ing brilliant. i swear if everquest and guildwars had some awesomesex, that would be my dream game born.the game is free to play and is probably one of the most honest free to play games i looked into for the most part. although most fp models are coming around. it never forces you to purchase anything and you honestly have little of a need to spend a dime. i however got sucked in a bit but paying to research some skills faster or upgrade them to the master tier. i also bought some cool white armor skins which you obvously dont need. iv also spent some station cash for instant repairs of my armor because i didnt feel like traveling back to town but repair men are all over and not to hard to find for the most part. i also sub'd last month and this month so i could adjust my alternate experience slider to give me more adventure xp for a few months but this was just something i wanted to test and it is a nice added feature but the free percent option is still more the viable and works behind the scenes so you dont even need to think about it. being at percent adventure experince also didnt feel like a grind when i was playing free, it just felt standard and a nice shinny option that was there if i ever chose to pay to use it. my best purchase so far though that most people may want to concider adding is the mercinaries pack which allows you to hire an ai companion that helps you in battle. not only does it make leveling a little faster before level it also makes it alot faster and combat will be alot easier with a merc, escpecally when when fighting mobs of heroic characters. i chose to purchase this extra fairly early on in the game with my real world cash as the higher the level you are in the game the more ingame gold he will cost to hire. buying this pack also allows you to summon tour merc no matter where you are. i dont use him a ton unless im running a dungeon alone so he is not to pricey for my in game budget but it is something that i sort of felt like i was missing before i purchased the addon. this just might be me though. playing the game without a merc is entirely doable you just might need to find a buddy instead and be a little social or if you have the addon find some buddies and bring mercs too.will hit the roof im assuming.i guess i was a little slow in the head because i didnt find the storyline quests in my log until my early s i think. man i was jacked when i found these though. they gave me more to shoot for. a reason to play and read these quests. i was having a ton of fun just running sidequests and getting the rewards and when i found the storyline quests and they even better loot they offered i got pulled in more and it gave me all new reason to keep playing. one of the story missions game me a raptor like mount for a reward. i was pretty pumped about that even though i already bought a horse. the raptor was slow though and had the ability to almost jump and glide. the gliding was cool but i was like this things way to slow so i never used it. now however im in higher level areas which require more climbing or going around mountains. while i swapped to my raptor and there was no more going around big long hills i could now set my tracker to where the mobs were and jump right over the big cliffs until i got there. its been saving me a ton of time. now im just in the middle of the content and im still having a ton of fun.daily achievments are also pretty fun and quite easy to get. completing will give you loyalty tokens that you actually want to spend. now i have token and im saving up for a wild ing mansion for or something. its worth it and easy to collect. cant type anymore :( steam! lol",1

5670,"as a hardcore flight combat simulation, dcs can't be beat by anything else out there. so much has already been said about the flight modeling, the graphics, the maps and effects, and the modules already - but the beauty of the system is that you can get as simple or as complex as you want, and you can mix and match modules to suit your needs. want to simulate wwii and the normandy invasions? there modules for that. want to simulate flying korean war situations? there's modules for that (except for a korea map). want to simulate gulf war situations? there's modules for that. fly planes off airfields or aircraft carriers, strafe or drop bombs on static or mobile targets, engage in air to air with guns or missiles. or simply fly around and check out the scenery.in my case, i set out to simulate my experiences with jane's f/a-e (from way, way back). so i purchased the persian gulf map and the f/a-c package (which is so, so much more advanced than the jane's model was almost years ago now). the price tag of the modules was a bit intimidating, yes - but after flying the f/a-c for as much as i have it was worth every penny. i picked up the a-c as well, and it's just as fun.i also fly exclusively in vr. the only issue with that is spotting - there are aids to assist with spotting planes which does help immensely. but there's no substitute really... flying the f/a-c off the carrier, flying a mission, and returning to land on the carrier is amazing in vr.if you are a flight combat sim enthusiast, and like to fly modern jets, there really is no other platform out there that compares. there are, however, some some important things that you need to keep in mind: there is a steep learning curve, particularly with the more detailed modules (f/a-c, a-c, f-, blackhawk, etc.). this is not a simulation where you can simply hop in a plane / chopper, fire it up, and fly loops around others. it takes time, effort, and lots of training and learning systems to fly these well - but it's extremely rewarding once you've put in the time. dcs world is a graphically intensive game, and has a lot of background stuff going on (particularly the campaign missions) that requires a good video card and a beefy cpu. you will need a decent gaming rig to get good frame rates - particularly so if you plan on trying it with vr. you cannot fly this simulation with a controller. just... don't. if you're serious about this, get a hotas. ch pro, thrustmaster warthog, etc. some of the newer modules are still works in progress, like the f/a-c. updates are frequent however, and new systems are being added all the time until the module(s) is completed (currently this applies to the f/a- and the f-). dcs has a huge online community, and offers many, many groups or squadrons to fly with that offer just about any situation you want to experience, be it pvp, co-op, co-op campaigns, or a mixture of all of it. dcs is moddable, and has a huge amount of mods available that enhance the graphics, or missions, or environment, or just about anything else. the built-in mission editor is fairly simple to use - but it is extremely robust and has advanced capabilities that allow for very detailed and complex setups that can create extremely detailed missions and campaigns. some of the modules (like the l- albatross and the f- tomcat) allow for players to simultaneously fly in the same aircraft - either for training or radar systems and weapon usage. as cool as this is, it's even cooler in vr. some of the modules are pricey, considering other flight simulation packages. however, the game does come with the caucasus map free, and you can purchase less complex aircraft modules (like the f- or the mig-) if the more complex and pricey modules don't appeal to you.if any of this appeals to you, download dcs today and give it a try. the base package is free and comes with the su- frogfoot (a ground attack aircraft), the p-, and the caucasus map. that will give you a taste of the dcs world package and what you can expect from it. additionally, there are a ton of videos on youtube that answer just about any question you might have about the sim, a given airplane, or most everything else.get it. fly. have a blast.",1

2638,"the game as it is is pretty good. i would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher / dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent. events are just tedious, mind numbing grinding. a recent event required you to do over games within days to get a tank or plane. or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for bucks. ground forces (tanks) is even more grinding than air forces. it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation. or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money. the ground forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank. for example: you have to research fire extinguishers. that can take a decent amount of games. especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank. while you watch. being unable to do anything. or well, you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money you have to train your crew. not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to (?) crew members in tanks. you have to train every single one of them individually. or you spend some bucks on them. air rb battles are unchanged since the game came out. they are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks. you often come out with just as much sl (in game currency to buy stuff) as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs their balancing methods are just bad. instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week, they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank (or plane for that matter) for months again. naval forces have been in closed access (meaning you have to pay to play them) for over a year now in the steam screenshots you can see u-boats. there are no u-boats in the game. they only have been in the game for one day (april fools)the list goes on. that's just what i have in my mind right now. you can take a look at more posts like these:/r/warthunder general rant/r/warthunder about repair costs/r/warthunder about their horrible pr/r/warthunder about repair costs ii",0

12877,"**tldr: requires lots of work, not fun at all, poorly made, exists only as a vehicle for microtransactionsfallout shelter started as a typical bs freemium game, made for mobile phones. the mobile game market is aimed at those who are susceptbile to addiction, and the games exploit players in a way very similar to gambling. there are lots of slot-machine-like sounds, and visual stimuli for completing milestones and objectives. payouts are randomized to encourage habitual attention. unlike gambling though, you'll never get money back out of it.the game is also a grindfest, making you perform tedious tasks, and wait for long periods of time. the waiting times gradually increase, eventually getting to as much as weeks to complete tasks. that's days of real-world time. for example, it would take dweller with decent stats weeks to make one top-level weapon. the reason it's so difficult to accomplish anything is simple: if you make players feel impatient, the most addicted players will pay real money to advance toward their goals.the gameplay mechanics are severely broken. the combat is sluggish, and not interactive in any significant way. the mysterious stranger random events are frequently interrupted by incident events, which automatically move the camera away from the where's waldo -second mini game, which by the way is already almost impossible due to the time limit.games like this are not made to be fun. they're made to exploit players.if you play this, expect to check in for a few minutes at a time, while you essentially babysit the game all day. every day. forever. it's more of an obligation than an actual game.they could easily make it more fun by reducing the requirements to complete objectives, or by speeding up combat, or adding v.a.t.s. to combat, or by increasing the variety of activities available. they won't do that though, because it's a lazy cash grab.",0

8972,"a one of a kind rough diamond. i enjoyed planetside since the release and keep on doing so untill it might run entirely out of players one day. yet, despite many people claim this game would die, this day seems still to be years ahead. i am always amazed about how dynamic battles can become when once you are in advantage sieging a base just to be flank-attacked by a coordinated batallion of tanks and aircrafts driving you back to the walls of your own base that you have to defend desperately. hours and hours of hard fights and fun.this game offers everything a fps gamer could long for. massive battles, sneaky stealth missions to disable the enemies defenses, dog-fights, tank warfare, a well executed squad and platoon system, high rewards for supporting duties like reviving, repairing, counter-hacking and healing. what ever role you want to play. just do. there is no limit on what ever kind of weapon and vehicles, noone holding you back, noone claiming vehicles exclusively to them like in battlefield. this game is purely for you to enjoy the way you want !!yet there are some considerations you have to make, when getting started. the game offers you a fair beginners package of all weapon and equipment needed to fulfill your class. the beginners weapons are all jack-of-all-trades, master of none, so keep that in ming when you encounter your first enemy with a shotgun up close. also you have to consider that this game has some ages behind its back and there are people who simply unlocked way more equipment than you have and are better trained in the mechanics of this game. this may be frustrating at first, yet as time progresses, you will grow and improve and so does your equipment. it is not battlefield, where you can unlock your entire class in a day. this game is designed, as many mmofps/rpg, that the players stick to it for a while. anyone who ever played a mmorpg like guildwars or wow will know that becoming one of the best considering the equipment involves time.none the less, this does not prevent you from beeing able to have fun. even though your own tank might lack the powerful secondary guns and utility equipment, you can simply jump into a tank owned by a experienced player and use it. people play together in this game and people share their equipment. simply ask in the world chat and someone will respond to you.there are days when this game can be frustrating as so many players (+) at once in a battle can cause net-code implications or it can simply be to much for a single player to process. rockets fly, more explosions than in a michal bay movie and pesky snipers everywhere. just remember...this game is yours. if a battle becomes frustrating because you are outnumbered or the region starts to stutter from all the people running around, don't respawn time after time and bang your head against a wall. at those times you can simply swap from the bigger battles into smaller skirmishes of > players and enjoy a much calmer match. the maps are huge after all and you have entire continents for you to choose. so if you are displeased then take a short break or simply join a smaller fight.lastly, if you ever feel that progression is to slow, just join a platoon and squad. usually community platoon leaders use %exp boosts to help out their mates, since leaders gain points from every player leveling up during their lead. you will see that this helps your grind tremendously and increases the chances of quality teamwork even further.just when you start, create a character on every faction. play them until level and decide on what faction to stick with (though you can come back to other factions anytime you like - weapon unlocks are faction exclusive though, unless bought with real money). also keep in mind, that this game really takes a day to adapt to it. you will die a lot in your first hour and this can become frustrating, but the learning curve is exponential and when you only had - kills in your lifes at the beginning, you can easily go beyone + kills later.enjoy your time on auraxis !",1

14432,"i really enjoyed this game. i spent entirely too many hours playing this game over the past few years and i truly loved it.one of the things that makes such an amazing multiplayer game like this is a healthy relationship between the developers, and their community.freejam recognizes this, clearly, because in the introduction to their product, they make the claim, “robocraft has been built with a dedicated community of robocrafters from the very beginning.unfortunately, it seems like they recently replaced someone within their company that has absolutely no respect for their community, or has no desire to retain their existing players.i was already extraordinarily upset when they removed megabots. that was a big deal to me because i had custom megabots which i spent countless hours building. they were the game to me... when freejam removed them (read: deleted) overnight, i was shocked.after a week or so, i got over it and rebuilt some bots and resumed playing, albeit a bit more reserved.this latest update took my disdain for change to another degree and completely removed my currency entirely, both of them. i had over million rp, and now it's gone. i had $ worth of their premium currency saved, gone.my compensation for this loss was a crate which had some white blocks in it.no apology, no words of solace or anything which might remotely comfort me and worst of all, no explanation in game.the fact is, these people have no regard for their community whatsover. they further have no regard for their time, or efforts. they simply don't care. plain and simple. they care about one thing.money. more specifically, yours. the individual reading this review debating about whether or not they should install it and give it a shot.go for it. install it, love it, build your dream robots and have a great time. it's a really fun game.unfortunately, for me (and thousands of others by the look of it) i'm done. i've spent far to many hours only to have my efforts tossed aside with zero regard.no consideration for their existing players.i quit.",0

13569,"this game looked interesting so i decided to give it a try. i play single player and after a couple of hours this game became tedious and boring. i have a logical mind and one of my first issues with the game is that the crafting recipes are dumb. some of the recipes have redundant materials like needing bedrock and stone slabs(made from bedrock or other stone types) which are the same material. an example of this is the obsidian mining cell. some of the recipes have requirements that don't even make sense like needing mushrooms and/or flowers for a component type item. the obsidian mining cell is an example of this as well. this redundant and unnecessary material requirement affects a lot of the recipes that i have unlocked at this point. the point seems to be to force exploration. if you want me to explore, give me something worth finding not dumb recipe requirements.another issue is that you waste resources because you must craft an item to unlock the next recipe. an example of this is i wanted stone windows for my building so i had to craft wood windows first to unlock the stone window recipe. now i have a set of wood windows that i will not use and those resources are wasted.i'm not impressed with the combat mechanics of the game either. all of the creatures i fought so far have a wide area attack and you must be very close to even get a hit. the weapons do little damage and on multiple occasions i ended up running for my life. your default weapon is stick. no joke, it's a stick and it's worthless. the first upgrade is a wooden sword and it's not much better.the storage units are inadequate in the game due to all of the resources you must collect. each storage upgrade from the basic wood chest that i unlocked only had about more slots each. not really worth the upgrades.the game also pushes paid content. if you want to fly, you must upgrade to pro. if you want the nice building blocks, you must buy the dlc. the developer seems to be trying to make a lot of money very quickly.to me, the game seems to be targeted at children due to its comic style creatures and feel. in summary, if you're willing to pay for pro, the multiplayer may be fun, but the content is just too limited for single player and as previously stated gets tedious and boring very quickly. to a logical mind, the recipe system just doesn't make sense. on a positive note, the graphics are nice. this is the only feature that i feel is better than minecraft (no contest).if you have a logical mind like myself, i don't recommend this game. other mindsets may find it likeable.",0

9817,"no do not please don't waste time downloading this game.i am a veteran player having played this when there were only four characters.this game at the beginning was very fun but quickly as i rose through the ranks and levels it just became so repetative. even though they have fixed a lot of the problems with the game the cons outway the pros by a land slide. pvp isnt fun whatsoever. for me i would always be put against someone levels higher than me and or someone who hasnt even played the game. don't even get me started on the amount of spotty connections you have. this game in general just is a massive decline. those willing to pay are given a giant advantage over people who dont pay and it just isnt fair. this is seen even in dungeon mode when people have mounts and payed for costumes and gear, they wipe through the dungeon without letting you get a single hit. boss fights are now a thing of the past with the new mount system! there dlc is just pushing it. im getting really out of order here but ill slow it down and focus on pvp a little more.pvp is absolutebr>don't get me started on balancing. as seen by the constant pay to win theme of this game pvp is completely unbalanced. its not just the pay to win theme either! the ranking, im level going against a level triple s rank. characters are complete and utter trash ranged characters are unfair and just filled with spam. some characters can even warp out of your combos after youve wasted hours just trying to get the slippery bastards into the combo.pve is absolute garbageits boring, repatitive, and just a waste of timethe verdict has been in. this game sucksbr>(oh btw check out voidmage_lowell's review probably right below my review. it just proves my points.)",0

13580,"even though i have said no to this title, i would like to stress that the idea and concept are perfectly fine. it basicly mimics minecraft with a smoother texture pack, and it's free. however the reasoning for a negative review are as follows;the interface is one message after another, showing you how to play and understand its menu systems. this is quite annoying. i understand its free and the whole microtransaction thing, but it feels very pay to get anywhere to be honest the person who came up with microtransactions should get bend and disappear, it is a lame excuse to not charge money but hinder free players at the same time.although it is cool that you can sorta customize how you look and your gender, it lacks any real option for players who wants to make the character look like themselves. (bald, hairloss etc.) lack of quality controls, i.e. making the game look worse to make it run smoother. i'm all for a beautiful game but if its in the same line as minecraft i feel the game should not slow down on my pc for any reason. before anything is said my pc can run bioshock inf. on high graphics at full speed. just to give a reference. and finally something that made me decide negative, its a clone of minecraft, i understand that sounds awful and apoor excuse, but it follows mojangs formula way too closely. i would've like to have seen, roughly the same formula but in a different manner, yes your pickaxe is a matter glove. cool i like that, its different. but again the rest of the game follows suit with mc. please note this review is of unbias opinion, it is nothing more than a review from my eyes and the way i see it. this does not reflect on the developer in anyway except for constructive critic. feel free to give this title a try if you wish, but as for me i will decline. thank youyou didn't even read this far...did you...",0

8870,"from someone who pushed masters in the first week of the game releasing, this game was incredibly unique, amazing and different to every battle royale game that i had played. the crafting system was perfect that forced people to fight at the start and win battles in order to reap the rewards of a legendary weapon, the risk of dropping in a populated area had a pay off because if you won, you came out on top with legendary weapon and gear to craft. now? my team mate drops, and instantly a guy gets his legendary weapon in the first chest and deletes everyone nearby. rng to this extent in a battle royale game should never be allowed, and it has completely broken the game. once this change is looked at, or reverted, i will happily play the game again. you should never encourage people to avoid fights and loot in a fast paced battle royale game, and there should never be rng aspects to that extent of someone winning a fight. cannot recommend in its current state. developers are all over the place and change the game on an almost daily basis. ask your community first about changes, after all, we are the players that play your game.",0

() times i lost vehicles on the player pve server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.i have also purposely lowered the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail. the $ is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace. also, note that the pve servers they provide is pretty much () for players. the rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience. without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want? also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server. ironically, when i st started, i was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either / or the () server /.for those that have not experienced what i have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see others driving on the player server... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another. if you are lucky to get on a player server, at least you have a chance to get it back if you can ge back onto it!to the programmers of this game. excellent graphics and artistic work. beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires. what is the point? perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen. a game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.thank you for all your time. the $ is gone and so be it. i do not want a refund but i do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for.",0

1010,"in its current early access alpha stage, i think this game is very nice-looking and fun. obviously it could use balancing and fixes and stuff since it's alpha/early access, but it's fairly good so far. very interesting and varied ship designs, with nice themes based on factions. if you're interested in graphics, then you might like the fact that the game looks very good even on low settings, although i will say the station models could use work. not that it's much of a problem though, since you're usually shooting other ships. as for gameplay, it's good that there are a somewhat wide variety of abilities and strategies based on the ships you use. the unlocking system doesn't feel like it takes too long, although it'd be nice if getting credits was just a bit faster. the premium currency doesn't over-saturate the game either, which is a plus. they don't shove it down your throat like other games. also, i might be a tad biased because i got the game for free. props to these guys for the free weekend that let me keep the game. <",1

5293,it's like super smash brothers brawl but a milllion times better. seriously with the easy to learn hard to master mechinaics this game has a very large potential for professional play. hopefully the master of this game gets a lot of money you could get a lot of money too because it is free so buy it / ign pwn noobers i hate trololers hahahahahahahahahahhahahahha-zyngified,1
14605,this game used to be amazing when it first released. but recently they’ve started adding really bad features like the ability to cop other peoples robots meaning that anyone can buy a good robot meaning that there is no skill required letting noobs run around with ships built by pros. i know the developers won’t see this because they would’ve changed the game so it was like the good old days,0

15074,"this is a good game that gets some unfair negative reviews and hate. i am going to address some unfair attacks at this game.the big thing about these negative steam reviews is that anybody can write them thus many loser players with idiot tank designs come here to take out their anger on the game’s store page. this is partly thanks to the chat window in the games main lobby where countless year-olds tell the whole server why they lost because smg’s are cheap and not because they rushed in alone with their no-armor hovercraft in between enemy tanks. when other normal players lose to an smg tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comments and join them, then they start venting their anger too. the other slightly more fair reviews i’ve seen are from the old-time players who say the game devs ruined the game. i’m a little newer at this than them and i’ve played almost hours of gameplay in these dark times, made it to t and had fun all the way, and there’s no signs of the fun stopping any time soon. the people who are having fun (and there’s a lot of us) don’t bother to write reviews, just the people who want to vent their anger do.the first thing people say is that this game is paywin but that just isn’t true. first of all, paying users and free users get all the same parts to work with and second, in this game your robot has a stat for ranking. when you add a part to your robot it raises the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier. there are tiers of robots and you just about always get put against robots in your tier so paying -win is impossible. the only thing paying does for you is give you faster progression through the tiers. some people say its pay to progress but i’m on top of t and i haven’t had that problem yet although i think during a certain update it was bad but they have already fixed that by now. progression isn’t super important anyway because by t every type of part is unlocked, just not the bigger stronger versions (which are in there own tier). unlike world of tanks and other fps you can still make cool stuff at lower tiers and there’s none of that “premium ammo” crud that i hate.now for the second big thing to talk about, op (over powered) weapons and parts. every type of weapon gets called “op” times in the same day because of that venting year-old thing i told you about before. one big thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha so balance is subject to change. i hate when people say “plasma has ruined this game forever” because even if plasma was cheap the devs would rebalance it asap. there are only different types of weapons in the game (for now) and they all have their intended functions. i’m not saying the game has always had perfect balance (and it still doesn’t) but it’s still a lot of fun to play. the last thing about balance is that a lot of players are new to this game and don’t know what they can do. an example would be that hovercrafts can dodge plasma shells vertically but i don’t see many players do this. those players could go on to say that plasma is cheap or that hovercrafts are underpowered but the real problem is that the players don’t try new tactics.people whine a little about other things like lag, warping and glitches but i have never had those problems, those things are just more problems that people unfairly vent out during their rants.overall i just wanted to tell you that this is a really fun game that can make you think and adapt, and also that the devs aren’t evil (i think), they gave us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they had. if the game gets big and devs finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game. thanks for reading, peace out!",1

11928,"honestly i think a lot of the reviews for the game have been overly harsh. the devs have already done a ton to fix the disaster that was launch day. yes, the skill translations are still absolutely terrible, but apparently they trusted the translations to a third-party localization company and they did ajob of it. here's some things that the devs have already improved a lot on:- i'm getting literally double the fps today in non-town areas than on the first day. can you really expect to have fps in the main town on the first day, when literally the entire server is sitting in one spot at the same time? i'm pretty sure wow's lagforge was the same- the annoying title screen bug has been fixed- server queues for all servers are down to today- no more quest lag, it's been fixed- and most importantly: the devs have apologized profusely and offered founders pack purchasers $ worth of in-game currency. and by the way, if you look at the cash shop closely, you'll notice that lumena buys convenience items such as teleports and inventory expansions and not power increasing items.people calling this game a cash grab, pay-to-win t, etc. haven't even given the devs a chance here. they recovered incredibly well from an enormous first day that was hyped up a by big twitch streamers.now, i'm only level writing this review, so i can't speak to endgame content. but i think steam purchasers have been burned so many times they're unwilling to put any faith in an early access title at this point. the devs have so far done everything right to help fix some honest first day mistakes and problems. i think the game still deserves a chance.",1

8893,"planetside is one of the toughest games to review. the sci-fi theme is rooted in a lot of s media and aesthetically superior to most futuristic fps games, held down only by fp items and inconsistent faction variation. the gameplay is reminiscent of older battlefield games, just on a much superior scale. outside of that franchise, there's so little competition that planetisde stands out even with many glaring flaws. providing a slow burn with teamwork and co-ordination valued above any silly k/d stat, perpetual war means little downtime, and hours can be soaked up. i wouldn't really call it immersive but as platoons are large enough to consist of combined arms fronts one can take position in all aspects of the war experience. the four main continents upon each addition started dividing up the player base , so they eventually (finally) added continent capping to keep it to only two continents, one with actual battles and the other with ghost capping squads. additional server mergers helped mitigate a loss in playerbase and server biases towards certain factions. this is the only fp game to my memory i directly spent money on so for all i can say, the cosmetics are overpriced. back in -, they ran a month long sale in december where their chosen cosmetic or weapon was dirt cheap. i would say without any doubt the game was not pw, but so much has been added since i stopped playing actively in . the new implant system is both limited and potentially too rewarding for those that luck out in rng, but less annoying than the old limiting system. additional disappointments include an overall graphical downgrade (old high is new ultra), questionable content upgrades, and a dev team that's missing the real spark the og team had. i enjoy the larger facilities but fights seem increasingly focused around fun points instead of them, with a huge lack of major facilities, cities or fortresses.indar stands out as the best map, with iconic points, three unique biomes and objectively the best vehicle and infantry fights. gun play is wishy-washy, some providing a satisfying dink, others feel floaty. medic and engineer provide mmo grinds for xp if the forces killing you in battles seem too external. sadly, this game is dying and i don't believe market trends or daybreak games can save it. issues preventing this from running on toasters already hurts much of the potential fp market. all in all, few games have the true wow factor or give me a desire to learn everything as does this game. remember to live free in the nc, and bring many friends or find them quickly, as only a few grunts won't provide a major difference against a trained platoon.***endnote***there's no way in hell this game is pay win for any combat purchases. if you're whining about having a terrible k/d there's no reason why the carv, saw or orion can't carry you. git gud or shut up. my k/d shot up after making sure it was only using raw input on my mouse, turning off smoothing/vsync and lowering my sensitivity to a fraction of the default.",1
3375,"i have been playing this game for hundreds of hours now starting before it was even published on steam. the original map was well balanced and fund to play with awesome drops and an all around good experience. with the way the game has evolved i feel as if it is moving in the wrong direction. this game was fun and unique with little to no bs. this latest update makes it just as bad as the rest, a pay to play game. other then the bs season pass crap, the no more free crates, and having to purchase credits in order to get new crapy gear...the game is fun to play and i hope they add new maps like the original new guns are travel methods would be dope to see. sad to see this game get ruined by bs pay to play for character skins... if they need more money then set a pay wall for the game to at least keep the game clean of hackers. they admitted to banning k players a day and this number will grow with the increase interest of the game.",0

8774,"the tldr here is that if you're looking for something less broken and trash than pubg, but you don't quite want to play fortnite with year olds, then i guess this game has you covered. oh, and, no, you're not that good, it's just that this game backfills matches with bots.this is another battle royale game. it's right there in the title, right next to realm. realm royale isn't really doing anything new or exciting outside some minor tweaks to the gameplay of your standard battle royale game. you drop into the map from an airship, you land, find chests to get weapons and abilities, then you kill your way to being the last person (or squad) standing.one thing realm royale does do differently is the class sytem. in similar games, you more or less drop in as the same person, no one person has some edge over the other except for skill and mastery of the glitches in the game. in realm royale however, there are classes, mage, assassin, hunter, and warrior.they each play the exact same and can use the same weapons and abilties. however, they do have small buffs to certain weapons if used, and drop into the map with different starting movement abilities. the mage can fly, the assassin can blink, the hunter and dodge roll, and the warrior has a super jump. there are some other movement abilties such as invisibility, or a charge attack, but those will have to be forged during the round or found in random chests.the other thing the game does slightly differently is the lives system.in other games, when you take too much damage, you go into a bleeding or down state and have to be revived by a squadmate, or in the case of solo queueing, die instantly. you can be further damaged in this downed state and killed, but eventually you'll bleed out if someone doens't revive you. in realm royale however, when you go down, you just turn into a chicken. you can still move and take cover (albeit with reduced movement and unable to defend yourself), and eventually, you'll b e back in fighting shape if you aren't killed while you're in chicken form. you can be chickened times before you die for good, but then you can still be revived by a squad memeber at a forge, granted they can afford the revive and aren't killed before the rez timer counts down.i will say that the choice to put loot inside independantly lootable chests is a great idea. it stops me from missing things on the ground because i didn't notice the muddy black texture on top of the muddy brown, and it stops the friendship destruction by making them independatly lootable, so there's no debating over who gets what. you can share the loot if you don't want it, and the game smartly places a pickup timer to stop people from stealing yourif you turn your back for a microsecond, but after the timer runs out, it's free game. this system is actually pretty good, i think they need to do a better job letting me know which loot is mine in a pile of new items, but overall, it's decently well implemented.i mentioned above that this game backfills with bots. this is something i didn't know going in but became really obvious after a single match. bots often run straight at you and either have pre-cognition and aimbot or get stuck on geometry and just eat bullets until they die. this game doesn't have a lot of players right now, so i imagine a large portion of the matches i played were over half filled with bots. often the last few players were the only real humans in the match to begin with. i'm not really upset with this because it means that you won't be queueing forever if the game can't matchmake enough people, but it is something to be aware of.here's the thing right. if you want another battle royale game, there's probably worse options out there somewhere. but right now this game only does *just* enough to differentiate itself that i'd only reccomend it if you have a couple of friends willing to download it with you.",1

7043,"the release of the elder scrolls: legends on steam is great news for fans of ccg ( competitive card games ) and the elder scrolls franchise!first and foremost, it is not pay-to-win, each and every card can be crafted with soul gems ( equivalent of hearthstone dust ) now, those of you migrating from hearthstone might bring up grinding. fortunately, very less grinding is required and here are the reasons why:. you can play against the expert ai in practice mode and get gems for each win. this is hard capped at gems per day. with this rate, you can get a legendary card in just days, if you are so inclined. ( for comparison, in hearthstone, it takes you a month to get a legendary ).. this game will award you cards, gold just for leveling up your character. the soul gems awarded to a player at the beginning are very generous, and can help you craft cards needed to make a budget deck. i have been playing since just days and already have % of the cards. . you can always play the solo/versus arena to get higher rewards, depending on how much you win. + wins will net you more than you invest. reasons why you should play tesl over hearthstone:. less rng, more skill. there are no cards with random effects (yet), and the game is actually surprisingly balanced, having no overpowered class or archetype as such. . with the way blizzard is approaching expansions in hearthstone, you will have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to even play slightly competitive ($+). the rune and prophecy mechanics discourage aggro/face hunter (face is the place!!!) decks which form much of the meta in lower-ranked games, effectively making low ranked hearthstone games stale. . an fp player can actually compete with wallet-warriors, providing he/she is willing to be patient for a while.( not hearthstone 'patient' lol) there are many fp players who have hit the legend rank ( absolute highest rank ).i see a bright future for this game, hearthstone always left a void, which other ccg's failed to fill. this game just might be the one.",1

9096,"okay, after playing the game for an hour, i wrote a sensible review of the game, stating i would not recommend it. the followling is myy reveiw after whole hours of existing as a miserable soldier in this war.i likened it being repeatedly kicked in the nuts and then coaxed into giving it another go. the first reveiw was more detailed than that, but that's the gist. i pointed out some sound flaws, and held up the graphics and stability of the engine and server. i basically said it was not my cup of tea. out of people found my review helpful, either saying “hey, i love games that repeatedly kick me in the balls!” and others who say “oh, that sounds like a waste of my time and energy.” either way- helpful.the people who did not find my review helpful took it upon themselves to say i was being to harsh, and also said i “couldn’t review the game after only hour.” i did. he was clearly in denial! but i downloaded the game again, just to be sure.after hours, i can say, i would not recommend this game to a friend. i just don’t think its fun! how’s that! vehicles- they are okay. the controls are messed up on the aircraft though. way off weirder than anything i’ve ever played were you fly a plane. but hey, i’ve never piloted an aircraft, what do i know? i know this wasn’t fun.character models- they are okay. you can customize them with certificates (or something) you earn or money you pay. pretty cool. also hard to tell people apart in various kinds of light. it’s not so clear cut as red dudes shooting blue dudes, when only small elements on a person’s suit are colored so, and the lighting is a hazy beautiful sunset purple. the high tech futuristic hud doesn’t know if a guy is friend or foe until its too late. maybe you can buy an upgrade for that . . . i don’t care. controls- they are okay. they are what i would expect. i like rd person with cover mechanics better, personally. i say st person shooter and honestly, you know most of the controls. nothing special, it gets it done.landscape- you are on a planet with some continents divided up into a bunch of hexagons. there isn’t much in the way or realistic geological terrain, overall (like you see in arma and dayz- beautiful and realistic). it is more of that sculpty lumpy mountain looking stuff, and here are some really big rocks, trees, a swamp, like that. some places are better than others. it’s not bad, it’s just nothing special. there is a base every meters or so, no infrastructure, no towns, no cities, no villages, no civilians, no factories, no mines, no wildlife, no nothing. this is a planet full of military bases and there are three factions of really stupid people fighting over it for what!?!? honestly, i don’t care. i didn’t see anything worth fighting for. that brings us to . . . .story- the planet should be a desolate wasteland of craters and corpses. or maybe one of the factions would have just nuked the whole place from orbit? basically these three armies are fighting each other with guns and vehicles when they have these machines that just spew soldiers into the fight. put them in vehicles or squads, or drop them unrealistically from low orbit. they run about and die, only to be spewed back out of the machines and given weapons and pointed in the direction of “enemy” like suicidal lemmings! why? there are evil republicans, of course, high tech homosexuals, why not, and super awesome rebellious rock-and-roll rebels! i don't know what they are fighting for.the action- the most fun i had was repairing stuff. i followed some tanks around and repaired them, used their guns until they needed repairs, repaired them. me and a billion others took a giant mushroom place. cool. i repaired some guns and shot at tanks and repaired some aa guns and shot at aircraft. cool. i climbed a mountain and got shot in the face. disappointing. most of it is spawn, turn a corner die, spawn run a half mile, die, spawn, grenade, die, spawn, fall, die, spawn, try to repair some shield generator, get shot in the face, die. wrap up- this is the longest review i have written. i honestly, just don’t really like wild disorganized hari-kari pvp. this is not a team assaulting a fortified position . . . it is three armies at each other as hard as they can, and whoever is standing on the pile at the end . . . wins?after minutes, i knew it wasn’t my thing. after hours, i feel cheated. i can’t get that time back and i gained nothing as a human. i already know we are insignificant and conflict is ultimately pointless. this game offers me nothing i can’t have somewhere else and have more fun. does that mean you will not like it? by all means, use that free will, you may love it. i have met plenty of people into s&m. would i recommend it to a friend? i did, because misery loves company, but i regret it. it was wrong of me in my subjective view of morality as it stands now. i hope he will forgive me one day. no, i will not recommend this game to a friend. if they ask, i’ll just say “nah, that’s not my cup of tea.”is there anything they could do to change it and make it more palatable to me? no, and i don’t think they should. the game has an audience that loves it. let it be.uninstalls like a champ, even the second time around.",0
9742,"swank animu simulator have you ever wanted to be a cliche shounen protagonist? then this is the game for you!!! this game is awesome! well... now it is...as many of you can tell, this game has received a lot of flak after adding the unbalanced charactersadd (prompting my joke above) and lu/ciel (no i didn't randomly throw in a slash the character is different people).these characters were able to (once awakened) keep an enemy in a combo for ever (which broke pvp causing the outrage). so finally kog has responded by no... not nerfing the new characters but remaking all the old ones!

2476,"war thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. i would have recommended the game years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now i wouldnt recommend it to anyone. more edits- apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier br even more. fs and hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. random sim mode was deleted and the t-s were given ammo that they never had. i think im done with this game for a while.edit- i have been playing the game again at a friends request and i have noticed some good changes.-they seem to have taken notice to us simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-we now have a somewhat polished version of ec mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-for the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. it is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-they fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. long range spotting was way better at the launch of ., but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog we get for every patch. its better than nothing, i guess.___such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors russia in every way.* zero involvement with the community. normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. these guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired really bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* plenty of broken promises everywhere. we were told we would have bomber internals over years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. we were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. they said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. we were told the game would stop at , but they are adding vehicles from the s because russia always has to one up everyone else. * historical accuracy was thrown out the window. they give russian planes lower battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that russian planes fight and lower german and allied planes. they also like to make russian planes and tanks way more powerful than they actually were* they keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the allied and german forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. at the same time, we are throwing russian documents at the devs that show how bad russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti russian propaganda.* there are plenty of planes that can not stall. most japanese planes and plenty of russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. it is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.",0

4955,"mammoth games,this game has brought joy for the past few years, but recently you guys have addressed an issue with passive gameplay in the wrong manner. removing the dodge feature simply does not prevent passive players from ruining gameplay. this was a useless thing to take away from the game and now i feel as if every player is just on a spam fest all throughout silver and gold rankings. the new dash feature is completely useless and brings no benefit to the gameplay. i never find myself in a situation where it is practical to move faster in a certain direction when a player can simply do the same and use combos. dodging is a very important key feature to any competitive platforming game. please bring back this good feature or find a more creative solution to fixing the spam issue which you guys made worse. at the moment i feel i cannot play this game with the amount of spam it's just not fun to rank up through silver and gold. i am not a serious gamer and would like to enjoy the games i play. thank you for taking the time to read my review and i hope good things are to come.",0

12228,"i am going to ignore all the technical issues with the game for this review for those things could be fixed.the combat in bless is garbage for lack of a better term. it was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is. there are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion...yet there is no such fun mobile movement in bless. there's no dodge, there's no blocking, no teleporting, nothing, you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion. (the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of seconds!) beyond the combat: bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. you kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. so, bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. also, as i'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. people in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different mmo in a language you don't understand. gear: initially (for the first levels, as far as i was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) easily the worst mmo i've ever played. most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.",0

(.)this game is great for those who like adventuring games and for those who like competition games. there are in-game modes, such as pvp or shadow towers. (.) explore new worlds taking on new dungeons and as you level up your character level and gear you can go to higher and tougher difficulty worlds getting access to worlds with gems (to further upgrade your character's stats) and new items. (.) daily challenges to earn rewards and do dungeons to earn rewards and loot. (.) make your own club or join other in-game clubs, start gathering materials to make your own legendary dragon mount, or take on shadow towers to get lots of loot. (.) the trove devs have life streams on twitch, if you have time watch them to gain knowledge on upcoming updates or changes to the game and if your lucky enough you may win really rare in-game items or mounts, such as the rare legendary bird ganda. (.) team up with others to make your game easier. only downside is how the devs keep changing the game mechanics, this would become a great game if they minimized making frequent changes (most of the changes in-game become beneficial to you) cons:(.) many people who have played this game may agree that they have experienced this while playing this game. which is known as lag. this has been a problem for awhile in trove. even after some patches and fixes some people still continue to experience lag. if you do not like lag this may not be the game for you.(.) there are some toxic people in this game who may target you for being a person that has just started the game. expect some people to say insults to put you down.(.) there are also scammers and spammers in this game. they seem to offer you a good deal but once you hand over what they want, they will either not give you anything back or give you something you did not want.(.) the game does have major updates once in a while and can impact your gameplay. some people dislike this.(.) the game over time has become more of a pay to win game. this had a negative influence and is drawing some people away from playing the game. (ahh did you miss the free items we gave back awhile go? guess what you can still get it by paying real money for it!) (oh do you like this? well you are going to need money for it). for example, characters previously were able to be bought with in game materials (it was very easy to get more characters), but now you have to pay real money to obtain classes you don't already have or you can make the classes but that requires many materials and that brings up the next con.(.) grinding/farming. this has become a foundation for this game. this annoys many people and may be the reason why the person does not play this game. if you want to become at the top of the game you are going to have to go through this. want to reach the max level? guess what you are going to fight enemies for a few hours just to level up once. want a mount that you like? you are going to have to spend some time getting the materials you need to get it.information:(.) trove does not offer refunds for things bought with real money in game. you could possibly get in contact with them.overall still a fun game to play despite the cons.",1

1039,"!!warning!! if you are not aware of it being in a alpha state. please realize, before you buy. this game is in a infant state.thanks.early access thoughts:i must say that i have participated in a few early access games. for the amount of content that is available, at this very moment, is already worth my $.: detailalready in its early state, fractured space has some good eye candy. there is some things that are placeholders, im sure. but, so far, it is very nice looking. the ship explosions are some of the best i have seen for a space game. it looks just as i would think a explosion in space would look like. the asteroids look quite well done. (i am hoping that the main base doest stay like it is. looks more like a fighting ring, than a main base..lol) : shipsthey are going for more of a team play mechanic. so you have your heavy, med, and light crafts. then you have some different roles tied into the ships as well. from a sniper, to a close up run and gunner. plus there is support class ships. like a healer, and one that can disable a enemy. very versitile, and logical, how the dev's have planed so far. : game playyou have two teams. fighting for control of five sectors. (which is quite large) two home bases, that are the primary capture point. the ships fly by using w/a/s/d/q/e.(sitting still will get you killed..lol) space bar will raise you, while ctrl will lower you. you aim, zoom in(like ads), and scroll in and out to zoom, with your mouse. there is a health bar on the hud, around the cursor/reticle. your abilites are on the numbers. you hold shift to pick a near jumpoint. (the animation for the jump does need some work. which im sure that they will) some ships cature points quicker than others. so finding the right balance for your play still shouldn't be too hard. now, in these five sectors of the map; there are mines to capture in the two lanes of alpha and beta sectors, which in turn will add resources for your team. these resources will compile, and add the ability to upgrade your ships damage/defence/mobility/and capture rate. the more resources a team has, the more upgrades to the teams ships. (so capture those points!!) there are four main points of capture, in alpha and beta secors.(on each side of the map) with three mines in both sectors. one large gas plant in the very middle. it is gamma sector. (but on the map, it is c, not g..bugs me..lol) the gas plant does not come online untill min of the match has past. and two main bases at the very top and bottom. i'll be honest, i don't know if it's possible to win by resources, or points. but, i do know that capture the enemies base will win the match. ui: can be a pain a little. but seeing how new this is, i did expect worse. it isnt that it is placed in a wrong spot. but, for instance; when fighting, my abilites are on the numbers -(i think..lol could be ) anyway, i want to keep flying, to make myself a harder target, and trying to do that, aim and shoot, then hit an ability without letting off the throttle, can be a pain..lol (to be fair, i cant think of it being much different. untill we can set buttons to what we want.) there is very little else i can say, as there isn't much in it at the moment. but, if you like sci-fi, and space shooters. then, this one is going to be good when finished. and, if you like to alpha test, then you should go ahead and spend the . either way, you can get $ worth of fun out of it, in its alpha state. in my oppinion, of couse.[edit] i have reinstalled this again..so much better! i might be willing to throw a few more dollars at it now..:)",1

8876,"i was starting to think this would be the battle royale game to really take over, knock fortnite from its throne and all that. the requirement of having a kill to forge legendary weapons meant there was real incentive to quickly go to a populated and dangerous area to get a powerful reward if you survived. weapon sounds and bolts felt different and interesting, skill-based, fair, satisfying to land. the different classes and abilities were fun, if not entirely balanced, but the chicken mechanic kept me lovin it.then with the newest update they made all hitboxes the same for the different guns, changed all the different bolts to the same boring, androgynous blue money shot. legendary weapons are no longer forged, but picked up completely at random (genious!). it's not even that it's less fun now, it's that it's not fun *at all* with these changes. i really hope the developers realise they've ruined what was a fun and really creative take on the battle royale genre, and while i have no idea how an adult human being with an average intelligence could conceptually think of the changes as for the better, i understand even less how those changes could be playtested and put through, even in a game in such early access. jesus christ..",0

14336,"look, for a browser like game, i've never seen a game like this, at least in term of business managament and comerce.this game allows you to open your own store, hire your own workers and make items and equipments to sell to the adventurers that shows up, alongside that, you unlock new recipes of weapons of either the same type, or different type, or even reducing the crafting material count of the item, aswell as increase the chances of crafting a higher grade item.the better the item, the higher the price, but you also have social skills to use in the trade, at the cost of some hearts, you can offer a discount to gain hearts, at the cost of a less pricy item, overcharge the the item to gain more lucre at the cost of hearts, or even give a chat to the buyer to have the chance of gaining or losing hearts.there is also a second fact, if the equipment you sell to the adventurer is better than the one the adventurer is wearing, the adventurer will equip it, but nothing stops you from crafting the item yourself and giving to the adventurers, so they have some gear.later in the game, you may even end up receiving adventurers at your shop offering you goods they found in some undisclosed location, you can bargain for lower prices before buying, or refusing to buy the item.the game also features a mission system, which in the inn, you can send your costumers to raid a (timed) dungeon, which after the timer runs out, you can check the result of the dungeon raid, i just don't recommend you to send your costumers to their private quests, i did those times and those quests ended up failing, making the costumers unable to do missions for around hours, which is a complete .beside the most impressive fact in this game is how the town system works, if you create or join a town, you and the other citizens can invest on the structures to unlock new characters, new workers, or even to increase the number of resource gathering per hour.the only con about the town system, is that if a citizen leaves the town, all the gold it have invested on the town structures will be gone, so you may end up even losing a character that were unlocked in the town due to that.and to finish the good part of the game, sometimes a npc surges at your shop, requesting a large number of items, when you complete that npc requests, you gain a good reward. i even had to use the market in the game to buy some of the necessary items from other players, and the good part is that they did a good price for me, so i were able to complete the npc requests.yes, this game have a market system, you can sell the things you do for a nice price, and then later check out for lucre, or you can look on the market for a item you are looking for and then buy it for the best price as possible.now, the annoying part of the game, is that having the npcs entering and leaving your town several times can end up being boring, since it's a chore to craft and sell the items to the npc, but you can try to offer them some more expensive items disponible in the shop instead, if you have the hearts for that, and try to overprice for a nice lucre.there is a limit for almost everything in the game, like furnitures placed, workers hired, how many items you can craft at the same time, and even workers you can have.you can buy the expansion for the coins you make selling items for npcs and players, or by using gems that are the game cash item, but if you don't meet the level requirement for the upgrade, the price will be insane (like, you make around k coins with some sales, the price of the upgrade is k because you have not the level for it), and sometimes you will feel like needing the upgrade, but will be unable to buy it because of the insane price, that unless you spend for it.the arena is the worst part of the game, you first join the arena to be shamefully beaten, you may end up finding a enemy player with characters of ten times more might than your characters, which is very absurd and primitive, the game should try to find challenge based on around the player might, so the battle have some chance of winning, and the tutorial arena fight you can't even refuse, so you are forced to lose miserably.almost customization items in the game are only by gems, while a few coin customization and upgrades are unlocked by levels, generally, only furniture or customization is unlocked per level.so, there is my review, the game is not really that bad, but at the first day, you may end up addicted so...don't forget to eat something, like someone here.",1

15662,this is one of the few if not only game i have seen that does crossplatform right. you can actually play with other people on different devices and not restricting you to one platform. the art style is unique and the characters have depth to them. the monsters are nicely done and interesting. i also like how the devs listen to the smallest detail that players want. artix enterainment is a very passionate indie dev studio. you can expect some crazy things from them. another thing i like is the fanbase. everyone i met was nice and are just as passionate as the devs.the game kind of gets repetive and i hope they revamp the rewards you get to make them more like um...rewarding. the crafting seems weird i'll have to see what they do with that. the game is in a simple state. pretty barebones but from what they are planning they have really big ideas for this game and i hope everyone of them gets fulfilled. edit: with the new edition of the greenguard revamp the game looks like it will be less repetive and less grindy as they continue to revamp all the older areas that were once a grind fest. being grindy is one of the most common complaints this game has so seeing them trying to fix it gives me more hope for this game.(will continue to update this review as more major updates come out.),1

9222,"tl;dra unique experience, no other game does combined arms this well at this scale. has a very steep learning curve, but it's definitely worth it.still an absolutely breathtaking game, more than years after release. i implore everyone to at least try this game! i owe some of my most amazing moments of gaming to ps.contrary to what many people say, this game is not remotely pay to win, at least in infantry combat. your starting weapons are great, any weapon you can buy are side-grades. they affect your playstyle, but don't give you an advantage in every situation. there is a point to be made in vehicle combat though, as some (arguably) must-have weapons have to be unlocked, such as rocket pods. luckily though, every weapon (except for the fancy decorated ones, which have no benefit over the regulars other than looking nice) can be unlocked with certs, this game's free currency.there's something here for everybody. like tanks? oh we got tanks alright. like flying? sure, you want a bomber, fighter or transport vehicle? more of a hit 'n run type? try the buggy or putting a grenade launcher on your quadbike! as for infanrty, the light assault allows you to scale walls, the infiltrator can cloak and snipe, the heavy assault has heavy hitting weapons and rocket launchers, it's all here. you'll hear some people say there's no reason to play any other class than heavy assault, but this is simply not true. yes, the heavy is capable of taking and dealing the most damage, but this is pretty much all they can do. if you learn to master the other classes, you'll be just as much of a threat. an infiltrator, for example, can sneak around the battle and start hitting the enemy from behind unseen. take advantage of your turret near a chokepoint as an engineer! the possibilities are endless. however, it will take you a lot of time to figure out what the best option is in any given situation. many players, however, are willing to help. don't be afraid to ask questions about anything! take note of what others are doing and try it yourself. if it's not working, that's not your playstyle, and you should switch.",1

5690,"the worst thing about this game are the prices for the more in-depth cockpits, but most likely if you spend that much on them in the first place, it will be very worth it. dcs is nothing short of amazing. it feels awesome to fly the planes, the learning curve is there, but after a few days, it's all down and good. the planes have weight to them, and even the simplest of maneuvers and procedures can't be done by just jumping in and acting like you know what you're doing.if you aren't an experienced pilot, no worries. you can start with circling airfields and landing at others, move onto some strafing runs, go to bombings, sead, and by then, you'll probably have purchased fc.speaking of fc, researching the expansion will likely tell you that you need the others, which isn't true anymore. it's an awesome expansion for learning to fly. fc is basically the bridge between the su- and aircraft like the a-c.it's a great game, and it's free to start off. if you like aircraft, whether it be fsx, arma, il-, or any other simulator, you will like this game.*also, even though the photos show the su-, and some other planes, you cannot fly any planes that aren't a). the su-t, or b). listed in a dlc.*",1

1421,"updated th october :be aware that you can also be suspended for no good reason because the devs don't want people to play the game other than in one single linear strategy. week suspension received because having anything other than the devs strategy means you are accused of throwing a match.---original review below...this game has just gone from bad to worse.the match making is horrendous and alway has been since the introduction of team win / loose mmr opposed to personal skills / contribution being rewarded. the game just doesn't have enough experienced players for you not to have a team peppered with lower skills or lack understanding of the main objective. the problem with this is your mmr value is penalised due to mmr only being awarded for a match win (so regardless of how well you do personally). the devs solution to this is not to fix match making but to hide the mmr value from almost everywhere, with the last remaining mention of it earmarked for removal if/when ranked play is finally introduced.furthermore the matchmaking has been bust since players were able to group and raise their mmr by often queuing against solo players. there is no option as a solo player to opt out of being stomped by a team on a rd party voip that has a team coordination advantage. a solution to this was introduced to split groups during balancing if the team mmr disparity was above a certain threshold but this has subsequently been removed. the shrinking of maps dumbed down the strategy in the game and increased the death match style it currently has with very short respawn times based on level rather than personal death rate. other changes such as opening up a path to your base if you loose a gamma fight further dumbed down the game as it made the match almost entirely about the outcome of gamma .there are so few players that the queue times for a match are insane, i'm talking around an hour or more waiting for a match in what is known as the bracket player pool. this is the case even though over thirds of the previous days highest concurrent player count are ingame.expect ai bots in pvp until you reach bracket too.still no voip service available in game and the next most pressing feature to be added is the addition of a new in game store, eh yeah go figure the priorities...edit: you also aren't given the choice of what game mode you wish to play within pvp so if you don't like the frontline mode it's tough because you can be placed into either frontline or conquest. another bizare decision as both modes require the same number of players. it's like they deliberatly think of ways to cheese off the playerbase.since the current experience is beyond frustrating i can't recommend it with the problems it has.",0

8724,"october - the latest patches seem to be more inline with what most players and i wished. the return of the class based gameplay, more weapons and multiple balance changes (still far from perfect) seem to try to pull this game to a better direction than the patches mentioned in the wall of text underneat.while the patches still have some glitches or bugs, they seem to be trying it to listen to the community feedback and to the fledged player base. or at least that's what they want to portray.if it is too late to save realm royale we will see. at the moment is on the verge of being declared an unnoficial online dead game, but seems to start building some traction yet again. it is far from being what it was in terms of playerwise or balance but is it going somewhere. q's ar e still long with sometimes minutes q and only regions (eu/na). hit registration with projectile weapons seem to behave worse if you are not playing on your preffered region, even if ping wise it feels the same as before.the direction the game seems to go now could change at any moment, if hi-rez decides that this is not racking on the money or the player base.for the moment i will change my review to recommended to try. it is not a fully recommended title but if you want a free decent battle royale you can get into it.an oppinion from a hardcoring decent realm royale playerone of the few br games i actualy felt good playing it regularly, competitvely. it was a unique take on battle royale that got under the radar for many gamers but i managed to catch it and get involved. while it wasn't for everyone it was something unique that i really enjoyed playing. the playerbase was not really big but you could get matches in a matter of minutes if not seconds. the game even being wacky and sometimes unbalanced or had some what the hell happened there still kept me in and wanting to do play it more.i played pubg like a lot, but never involved myself in the game, the market or the genre like in realm royale. it felt close to perfect experience, downed down by some inconsistencies, slow developing time and too few classes and weapon variety.when i wished for variety i never expected that this is how realm royale will become. after some controversial, unnannounced, untested patches went straight to live, or to live after day of existance on pts i was skeptical about the development cycle, but afterhuge community backlash, they kind of modified the patch and removed the issues, even if was a bit later than wished.while the gameplay becaim a bit stale in the last patches, people playing metas and the to op engineer, at least for squads, i still enjoyed it and was a blast of fun times and rage times playing with the people on discord. i still was drawn in.unfortunately, erez (ceo of hirez) decided that realm royale is bringing money and it could do even more if they pull in some players. the choice of pulling in some people was made in detrimental to all actual and old realm royale players who put money into it, and was also detrimental to the complete realm royal formula and to everything the game standed for. uniqueness. realm royale became a complete different game on pts and now on live, one that tries to emulate experience from an amalgan of battle royale games that have a big number of players actively.while the community complained and tried to provide feedback about what is wrong about the patch and how they should bring the old realm royale experience back, or at least try to make some adjustments to the game that is as of now now completely different, hirez (erez) decided to push the patch live. the patch portrayed bugs from previous versions of realm royale and even lack of animations or legendary abilities that are or were at the time of writing this broken.also, erez ceo of hirez, recently insulted a high profile if not the highest profile streamer, competitive player of realm royale who was commentating in a negative manner about the last patches. erez posted to the live streamer: play the game the way you are supposed to, with a team and stop crying.the direction of how this game went from an almost overnight sensation to a decent player base and now to a complete mess, is abysal. while i think that the (old) game could have been decently present in the market with some changes, new content drops and events, now, i am afraid that the game will die before it even gets out of early access.the console version has been put on hold, and the duos or solos in the pc live environment is momentarly a work in progress after it has been pulled out of the game, in order to make it more competitive.queue times are still decent at peak online times when both eu and na population is live, but when trying to play on eu when eu is on sleep or trying to play on na when most of na is away or sleeping is almost impossible with ques taking plus minutes.also playing from another region (only na and eu servers) has a ping that is competitively innefective, especially with the projectile slowed weapons.eu and na servers are the only one remaining due to low player numbers on the other regions, like south america, africa, asia and australia.even with one que (squads) but not being in a popular hour will make your wait for matches.a game who lost a lot of it's playerbase, % from the time it launched in early access still retained a ~ active (concomitent) player count daily, now it struggles to maintain half of that. tldr:realm royale for me and for a lot of players was a game really unique, fun, enjoyable, competitive with few issues in gameplay but some in balance. still the developers tried to balance the game at much as they could, still ignoring the comments of the playerbase. was still a decent experience. now, erez (ceo of hi-rez) just said a you to all players and decided to pull out every uniqueness of the game and basically modify the game completely, that only looks similar to what it was before. they tried to bring in more people by borrowing concepts from other games, being more casual and easier to play. they did not achieve nothing, but they managed to drive off their playerbase and attracted no one new, or at least no one to overpass the big ammount of players that left.realm royale is a sad exemple of a game that was technically decent and had a unique style getting destroyed by corporate greed, not listening to your playerbase and feedback and shelling early access as a motivation to bring in the new changes.realm royale is one of the few games that had to change the entire steam page to reflect the new changes, and is one of the few games that changed it's entire identity in the course of the early access period, totalizing months at the time of writing.while not popular it still had a population that could make this game last for at least - months more and with an actual driving force it could have become one of the better battle royale games. now, it's a graveyard. hopefully, soon, someone will get fired for this disaster and they will pull out the sinking ship. if not, it will go deeper and deeper in the nothingness of time.for what is worth, i am happy for the purchases i made in old realm royale. i received cool items, a semi interesting battle pass that kept me playing and the tought of supporting the developers of realm royale. but i never expected this to happen, even if it is an early access. i would have never put money in what realm royale is now, even if i would have never played the old realm royale.",1
7041,"after spending the majority of my afternoon playing this game i can say it is really good! if you enjoy the elder scrolls series and are found of and tcg like harthstone, magic the gathering, or even the warcraft one, this is for you. it nails how a online trading card game should be. the mechanics are balanced and fair, plus this game is far more skill based over the dumb luck approach that some tcgs take (*cough cough* hearthstone *cough cough*). the cards are easy to get through leveling and i quickly found my self with a surplus of options. the game even gives you some tough chocies early on. the race you pick at the start even influences what cards you will be getting more of at the start. the story is decent to. nothing extreme but i found my self chuckling at a couple lines and even caring about one of the characters that shows up. there are also checky nods and reffrences to the es series (not going to spoil them though because some them are worth the reaction). over all i think this is a very good and well made game and i look forward to playing it more.",1

6913,"so..this is my opinion about this game after playing it for over months with over one thousand hours played.short form: extremely fun game with nice balancing that has some minor flaws here and there.long form:this game combines alot of interesting aspects making every game played to something realy cool.im talking about a dual colour system, prophecies, lane mechanic and much more.a dual colour system allows alot of deck creativity and at the same time viability. currently there is only one colour combination that i dont see as viable, even though people still have success with it.this alone also speaks for great balancing. bethesda is constantly balancing cards. not only nerfing the op ones but also buffing underplayed ones. thats simply amazing.prophecies make the game exciting and frustrating at the same time. it just prevents this game from getting boring and you learn to play around it as much as possible.the lanes make this game also more skillbased than for example hearthstone. you always have a decision to do even if its obvious which card you have to play. this is one of the reasons i like this game so much.another point that is probably very important for most people is the fp model.bethesda is being very generous with their rewards. so dont be discouraged by the expansions we already have. it will take you maybe months to get all the content unlocked and have most of the cards. without any investment besides playing the game for hours a day. so compared to other games the fp model is realy rewarding. since you get - gold every wins and a random card or pack. it can even be a legendary (even though rare) epics on the other hand are not so rare. you usualy get atleast epic card.the only thing that i dislike about this game is the compatibility for either my hardware or windows as it sometimes lags ingame.overall a great game!",1

9092,"a review shouldn't really be needed as the game is freeplay and you are free to try out yourself, yet i'll still leave one for anyone interessted.i really want to give this game a thumbs up, but various factors have given me a more negative outlook on it than a positive.i have played this game since beta long before i got steam and it used to look absoulutely beautiful. the large battles of the time was clearly ahead of its time. a few bugs here and there, but nothing too gamebreaking. the biggest problem of the time was performance, as many people weren't able to play the game without having massive lag spikes or fps drops. the performance have improved since then, but thats about all that has improved, imo. the graphics now are drastically worse compared to how they used to be. ultra settings is now high. so much atmosphere and beauty has been taken out. details, lighting, colours ... all stripped away and replaced by some depressing excuse for graphics. before each fp faction vehicle looked unique to the faction, but as of now, if you are a fp, your vehicles looks gray and boring. no details or anything. just a gray box you're driving. before they used to have so much details. players say its because it created performance issues, but i can't get myself to believe that when they continue to add crazy glowing decals, overdetailed camoflague and purple, sparkling burning skulls. i think its more about forcing fp's to pay for the game. it also ruins immersion for the pp seeing such sad looking vehicles compared to before. here is an example: other part is the community. i have met some silly and cool people trough my years of planetside , but the community, contrary to what they will try and make you believe, are mostly filled with salty burnt out veterans that still lives in their moms basement and gave up college for this game. its a community that is unaccepting to new ideas, unaccepting to having a different opinion. all they do is constantly suck daybreakgamesand attack anyone who point out a flaw with the game like hawks. they are completely intolerant to any negativity towards the game in its current state, and many are toxic ingame. and thats my experience with it. the community used to be filled with all sorts of interessting people. now there are only salty veterans left. that and a few unlucky new players who are getting farmed over and over again nonstop to nonend. mechanics like kdr is present in many games, but not everyone will have it displayed on your profile without your consent. anyone will be free to watch your k/d ratio at any time, wich promote bad playstyles. many people say you shouldn't care about k/d. that it doesn't matter. and altough i agree with them that you shouldn't care, that doesn't stop it from leaving a negative impact. you see, altough you don't care about your k/d, most of the current playerbase does, and it promotes playstyles like camping. few people are pushing or playing the objective as the stats gained from doing so usually doesn't show well on your profile. before people used to fight each other in huge epic battles, yet now everything feels empty and boring as most people stick back and only care about farming kills, and nothing more. i think this greatly damages the gameplay and will without a doubt burn people off this game alot quicker. altough many say you start out with the ''best'' weapons, people paying for the game gets things like implants, wich will give you bonuses in battles. they are possible to achieve without paying, but it is a massive grind. this means that the game as of current is offering paying players an unfair advantage over players who are not paying, wich isn't okay in my book. the fact that you start with the best weapons isn't entierly true either. many weapons that force you to either pay or invest massive time into the game is better than the starter weapons in most situations. new players get a sniper rifle that requires two shots to the head for a kill. veterans gets snipers that require shot and are much easier to use. doesn't seem fair to me.trough the years, this game has gotten worse and worse. the playerbase has dropped, the community turned to the gameplay turned toand the graphic turned to perhaps this will be an eyeopener for daybreak. maybe they will change things more to how they were before and expand on that, rather than ing up everything that was good about this game. either that, or the community will attack me and tear me to shreds for as much as mentioning this, calling it all lies. i don't hate this game, but its going down a bad path and i don't like it. if they don't change their methods soon, this game will soon be dead. constantly adding hats and cosmetic items won't save the game. focus for once on fixing already existing problems holding it down will.but the game is fp, so feel free to check it out. maybe you enjoy it. but don't let this be your one and only impression on the game. if it burns you out, check on it later. it might have improved since then. and you won't regret it.",0

12480,"i'm going with a 'yes' to 'do you recommend this game ?', but that 'yes' needs to be qualified. if you want an easy arcade style game, as a lot of the other reviews suggest to me, then move on, this isn't a game, it's a serious simulation. like most serious simulations, you can't expect to get everything in one download. you buy the base and then you add the elements that interest you, just like people did with scalextric or electric train sets back in the good old days :) the advantage of this offering is that the first part is free. it doesn't include a lot, but if you have some patience, there is enough to get a feel for what is on offer and decide if you want more.i have tried both assetto corsa and raceroom experience this past week. my first impression was that assetto corsa was better. it cetainly has the better interface and the option to set up the cars to some degree is attractive. rr has some problems with it's server and the current nvidia drivers, but, while frustrating, these are not major issues, assuming these will be fixed in the near futures. both simulations promise multiplayer options, although it looks like the rr option will be limited to the dm experience dlc for now. for me the availability of the dm experience tips the odds in favour of rr for the moment, but i'm happy to follow both for now and see what the future brings.one final word regarding control options. i haven't tried either simulation with a mouse/keyboard option and i don't think this would be much fun. a pc xbox controller is what i am using at the moment and i find it adequate for the for the 'amateur', as opposed to 'novice' level of skill.",1

10555,"this is an early access game, and my review reflects some of the problems in it. this is not meant to be a bashing of the game, and anything i mention may have been fixed by the developers since this was posted. this quote from the developers is pertinent: “we're committed to offering players the best card game we possibly can...and that's hard, and messy, and takes time. onboarding players gradually helps us make sure that the game you're playing is the one we set out to make, and the feedback we get from our growing player community helps us chart a course for launch.”bottom line: there is the potential for a great game here, but right now (july ), there remains a lot of work to be done. i cannot truly recommend this game as i played it, but i am not going to not recommend it. give it a shot, you might find it works better for you!first big issue: why is my steam log-in not enough for this game? why do i need to create a seperate account for it? other game developers have managed to combine their games with steam log ins. please try to do the same!second issue: in the latter parts of the free/unregistered tutorial, some of the cards did not function as indicated that they would. in particular, there was one which was supposed to let me play it when it was dealt, but i couldn't play it, nor did i get the results from having been dealt and then playing it. i hope this game continues to be developed and grown!",1
9214,"for a fp fps mmo game, planetside hits the nail right on the head. it is essentially tf except on a massive scale (when i say massive i mean massive. think of a map as big as a free roam rpg.) with vehicles, more players and endless fun. i never played the original, but this would probably be better. it is also a first person shooter.it is a hard thing to review planetside . there is just so much content. we'll star with the good:the good:the map size is massive! a whole continent. and not just one continent. three! with another one releasin in april . every inch of the map is accessible if you have the right equipment. from the sweeping planes, mountains and desert of indar, to the barren and snow swept continent of esamir, with its huge craggy purple things and plains of snow, to the lush forest of amerish, with its trees, grass and mountains. there are three different factions to choose from: the glorious terran republic (my personal favourite), the xeno-tech worshiping turds of the vanu soverignty, the rebels dogs of the new conglomerate. if you want more about each of the factions, here is a link: there are five classes to chose from in planetside : the infiltrator who handles sniping and sneaking. the light assault who flies around the battlefield with his jetpack. the heavy assault who just shoots stuff with a huge amount of ammo and has heavy armour. the combat medic. he (or she doesn't matter) heals allies and shoots stuff if they get in his way. the engineer who repairs vehicles, sports the same weapons of the light assault. there is one last thing i have to mention on the classes: the max! this is just a smaller mech. he has two mounted weapons, huge amounts of health and a high kill rate. engineers heal him and medics revive him.the amount of players. you need lots of people to fill up a large map right? well here we have hunrdreds of players per side! and if you are lucky enough you may get a three-way battle.finally, the vehicles. you can use vehicles like the flash and the harrasser to get around the map fast. things like tanks steam-roll anyone who gets in their way. planes can get you around, destroyand be mobile spawn sites. sunderes on the gorund can also be a moblie spawn site.the bad: the lag. do not play if you do not have a good internet connection!!! there is so much lag if you dont have a good connection speed. it makes the game a horror to play.sometimes other player are real dip. they team kill you, run you over and scream and swear a lot! there are also a huge amount of micro-transactions. like for weapons (you can buy them with ingame money as well, but it takes for ever to get a good one). they are also for vehicles and aircraft. but this is not that bad as you can buy the station cash (micro-transaction money) with steam credit.also, there is a glitch that i experience when if i log off to play another game and i come back later, i can't log on! not sure if i'm the only one though... but if anyone else experiences it, please tell me!rant ended.conclusion:all in all this game is awesome and you should really get it. there really is no reason not to since it is free. out of ten!",1

10072,"i believe this game could use more reviews from people who actually play so...in one sentence, this game is the absolute best hunting game in history, but the developers know it and will make you pay for it accordingly (meaning in excess).do not let that scare you, for $ (but no less) you can get up and running for a while. but the devs are devious little swindlers ;) so send you first dollars carefully. all those bad reviews you see... all bad spenders *tisk*tisk* the dev game => devs want you to buy small stuff piece by piece and have designed the price structure to force your normal human brain to do just that. here's what you do to avoid the trap. i. buy the trailrunner pack ($.) and nothing lower, here's why. - month membership: you need this to play and its a super cheap rate in this pack. individual licenses are for fools, period. - . rifle and scope(::hint:: mousewheel my friend): most accurate rifle in the game and my personal favorite of all time. - full boone & crockett clothing set: really, really good for deer/elk/moose. - start up set of callers: obviously essential and you have most of what you need - deployable hunting towers (where my other two devs?!?!): can't buy more of these and they are best hunting towers in the game (note: take two real days to build so choose a good spot :d). the pack is the only way to get three right now. ii. did you follow the ^ first step ^ ? good, i just saved you ~$ and a terrible sense of moneywhen you first start playing. after you enjoyed your new toys and learn the game, you will start to want more stuff, and hence put in your first $-. again, remember to defeat the developers at their own game. - only, only, only buy things that you intend to use immediately and have some plan with. don't just buy things that look cool, have some purpose so you don't waste your cash. - buy one gun or equipment piece at a time and learn to like it before buying more, one toy at a time. - always check the 'bundle' tab first for what you want. - bows - buy the most expensive 'python' bow and the pin sight. this is actually the easiest way to start bowhunting and your workhorse. iii. last word on price, i have spent ~$ so far and its without question worth it (or close enough). most actual players (+ lvls) spend to that and above with the same attitude. if you spread that cost over time and not waste money, you will start to enjoy each new purpose.---okay, finally the game review!!! (f'n developers, look how long the warning took?!!?)thehunter is in the category of game you need to place if you are interested in hunting and are patient (aka like simulation/exploring/survival games). i know what your saying, more bullet points it is!! - the enviroment of the game is perfect. graphics are beautiful and are perfectly balanced to appear as little like a video game forest as possible. the sound is impeccable, the background noise is exactly like a real location and the active noises (calls, gun shot) are filtered so that you can almost get a real sense of their location. - ai is intelligent, bam. animals will wander around in paths that make sense, sometimes in packs sometimes not. they can hear and smell you way before you may notice them. each animal has its own behaviors and patterns and active times and critial hit spots and on on on... once you get good, you can turn that intelligence against and lead them right to where you want >:) - maps, you will start to love the maps... each map has its good spots and bad spots, but once your more knowledgable, you will love walking around and discovering get hunts. i live in colorado and spend a lot of time in the mountains. this is the most realistic forest experiencei have ever seen in a game.alright, official review over but those that are interested, heres a simple strategy guide for your first few hunts. - pick a map that is one of the first four on the list and start your hunt - am. - walk (not run) along one of the paths, do not touch your callers. - do not follow an animal trail until you know the animal is close by (call, sight). that trail could be min or more old and a complete waste of time. - listen for a call, and note the location, give a call yourself (one), and walk towards it. - start looking for a good location closer to the call, preferably to the side. you can call once or twice more but no more. calls dont stack, they will only be refresh if you are closer to the animal. - think one shot, one kill and side is always best (slightly above front leg on deer). wait for the animal to pause, press space to hold your breath, and shoot. - get that kill!!alright for real, this is a wonderful game and one i have put lots of hours into. join but be wise or experience cash whiplash like you have never experienced before.",1

5189,"product received for freeearly access reviewhuh where i even start...the game it self it's just another d party fighting game based on multiple gamemodes. once you start the game for the first time. you probably are gonna play free for all since it's the most gamemode played when you start playing it. you have characters to use and more coming up, but there's only characters to use for free per week you can also unlock characters with the currency of the game, each one with types of weapons including the unarmed fists. the game it self it can be seen as a competitive game or a fun party game depends on the case your working.once i got hours on the game i started playing the gamemode ranked. where i started learning a lot of the game and also some cool tricks to use like the gravity cancel, once i knew some combos with my main character (asuri) i started taking the game as something more serious since i never had a game that keep me playing it for that time. i started playing the game since it was around weeks old. so i grew up with the game, i never wanted to search for combo videos since i wanted to learn how to play it by myself. so after hours i had atleast characters unlocked i was rank gold with only one skin buyed. since it was thoose days where i started using other characters instead of my main character. now that i passed the hours i can already tell that i spend a lot of time of this game. around hours per day. this game make me find new people who are now my friends. but as always nothing it's perfect. this the moment when i stop talking about the pros and start moving to the issues i have with game. the game itself it can be seen as a competitive game, but that doesn't mean your not gonna find people who probably be there just trying to be a jerk with everyone they found on the game. the game it'self has some players that take the game to seriously so they probably will try to win no matter what instead of having fun as the game it's supposed to be. so don't feel angry if you fight someone and after the match he left without saying gg or letting some insults in the chat, and also when they won they will probably will say ez instead of gg. to make the things more easier to explain, you will find a lot of salt on this game.at the topic of microtransactions. this game like almost every fp game, have microtransactions, but that doesn't mean this is a pay to win game. since that the only thing you can buy it's character skins, k. o. effects, sidekicks, and avatars. so the microtransactions doesn't affect the gameplay itself. if i was a videogame reviewer, i will probably say that this game itself it can be funny to play but only with friends. but since i have + hours on the game, the only thing i can say it's...and it's pretty amazingit's a pretty fun game.-rayzoomfox",1

6713,"so with + hours of gameplay i belive my review can be considered relevant.i started playing this game almost a year ago and was really into it. i know it is still in beta so there would be updates and stuff.so as the time went they added new stuff, which was cool. but then the updates werent really updates...but downgrades. with every single one, the game got worse and worse. constantly messing up with the stats of vehicles and weapons just got ridiculous. even though the developers claimed they wanted to have each faction different sort of gear, good and bad, they started to mess things up so in the end it doesnt really matter what side you are playing, its the same.the worst thing is that this game became pay to win. so if you are not willing to sink hundreds of dollars into a computer game, dont install it. after the last update the prices went triple and possibility to earn credits in game was reduced by half. another funny thing is that the developers claim there is million players well there is at max thousand online every time, so i guess the total amount of active players cant be higher than k..which is / of what they claimto conclude it, it gets worse and worse with every update. i will give it two weeks, then i quit as well.",0

4202,"if you played and/or play the normal yu-gi-oh card game, i do not recommend this. its a sad immitation. don't get me wrong its oddly enjoyable, i mean i put in hours into it, and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then minutes, but its not something i can take seriously.cons:first, they cut the game in half, which means, half the deck size, half the hp, half the time, and half the cards on the field. biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that, so that means you have cards the ask for hp and combo cards like exodia that are useless.the game forces you through a progression system, that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction. i understand explaining a game to someone, but anything bellow level is no challenge at all, and thats with a halfdeck. to give example of how bad it is, level and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss, and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long. the ai is super simple. now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage to even play against players. just to clarify what i mean by no challenge, is the enemy does not place spell or trap, and nothing above crappy regular stars, which can be easily out done with one of your first cards.last thing i have to say, is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical chinese knockoff, they put in a attempt, tried to cut corners, and it turned out likepros(yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it):matches are fast, so you can enjoy a few during a break.its more portable, so yu-gi-oh on the go.less money to get a insane amount of cards.good way to try new cards, and card combos.they implement a auto-duel feature, making the boring duels shorter, more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck.voice actors from the anime.",0

13028,"this is a fun low-maintenance game that does a good job of using the fallout world, giving you missions to collect loot and makes good use of the special stats system.main criticism is the ui which is ported from touch screen and it can cause some annoyance when trying to select a particular character as you can easily miss. also, it's too easy to inadvertently pick someone hidden behind a wall when you move the screen around. i haven't spent a penny of real money on this and i'm up to something like dwellers. each time i log in i usually have a new dweller waiting to join my vault. in fact, i have so many of the little guys in there it's getting hard to juggle them around properly.some tips: training dwellers by assigning them to training rooms where a particular stat is improved is essential to getting the vault working efficiently. after they have improved a stat assign them to the corresponding work room so they can level up. having high level characters and arming them all is the best way to give your characters a good chance of surviving vault attacks and having success on missions. the only reason to spend money is if you're really impatient, but it would be poor value so i don't recommend doing that.",1

9155,"planetside , is one of the most impressive games i have played in terms of scale. the maps, or continents that you fight on are enormous and simulates a real war, requiring both skill and strategy in order to be successful. for a fp game it is definitely worth a try. saying this, however, planetside has some frustrating flaws in ts presentation. pros: the game is huge in scale and beautiful in look. large fights with platoons can be very fast-paced and exciting. free-to play. cons: planetside requires a decently strong computer to play and its scale can lead to a lot of travelling on foot just to get into a gunfight. newcomers have very little room to improve and the game is easily dominated by those who have more experience. certs the points with which you use to purchase upgrades take a long time to get and in order to unlock a gun you must play for a great deal of time. lastly, the any vehicle can quickly kill you, which leads to many frustrating moments while playing.",1

14720,"it's been about a year since i wrote the original review. somehow just about everything changed and i still have the same gripes with the game i had back then as now. balance issues persist, drones still reign supreme over all other bot types, and matches still feature people who routinely disconnect and other network issues. meanwhile the main initiative freejam has taken on improving their game is to advance robocraft into 'beta' which apparently entails throwing everything relating to game modes out the window and changing the point of the game from destroying enemy bots to standing on rings, blasting crystals, and endlessly punishing bots with slow mobility. what's funny is that in the face of all that, they only slightly tweaked a few balance points about the more broken weapons and mobilities to be less outstanding (and to their credit, in response to a lot of player feedback over the past several months as well), but the rush and apparent decision to enter beta and somehow trash every single map they had developed for the game up until that point just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything and shifted the game balance even more weirdly off center.there's a ton good about this game - robot construction is flexible and stable enough to let players build in just about any shape or configuration and have a functional fighting machine. a combination of paint and various block shapes allows players to construct bots with legitimately pleasing aesthetics and just really cool shapes. the decisions that players make in setting up their vehicle carry over directly into gameplay as well, with the unexpected structural weaknesses and exposed weapons being prime targets for skilled players to shoot in lieu of 'headshots'. at its core, robocraft is a game with sophistication and reactive tactics in terms of how to fight with basic marksman weapons, and this is an element of the game that has thankfully survived intact ever since i started playing the game back in - when there were still cockpits and a weird tech tree. even with all the new weapons they're trying to push, my favorite guns are the laser (smg) and railgun (sniper rifle), which both emphasize careful aiming the most of all weapons. in terms of effectiveness though, ions (shotguns) and large plasmas (grenade launchers) currently reign supreme.with everything i've seen, i simply don't believe that's how freejam sees their own game. i still cite one of their mislead past decisions that thankfully didn't carry through - a recalculated damage system where it wasn't possible to damage components or immobilize enemies aside from just stripping off their whole chassis and vaporizing the whole bot. that was a decision that, if it had actually gone through, would've killed one of the main redeeming factors of its gameplay for me. reflecting on it, it really illustrates what i think i've come to realize, and it's that freejam just doesn't know what they want from their game, and still cannot recognize what they're trying to go for. it has no mission statement. instead, they are mostly trying to blindly follow the leader and seem to be focusing a lot of their attention on making the game more 'accessible' to a wider demographic. that really could just be what robocraft is, though. they might've just sat down one day and said 'what if we combined minecraft with world of tanks?' and somehow it worked for about years. with how much i do like the game's potential, though, i really hope this isn't the case.",0
16363,i played it once and it lost its magic. you have to pay for more guns and after you've done one gun you've done them all. it's seems like a game that would be very cool but is very bland and they threw in the mini-games to fix that but it didnt help at all. fun at first but has no replay value.,0

3687,"this is a long review, if you want a short quick review, skip this review...year of playing tf.where do i start this? idfk, this game has made me speechless about making a review.i once make a review when i played it for + hours, and + hours, but this time i gonna make a really serious review about this.tf is fun. any game mode, any class, any server, it's a never ending gameplay makes you feel like to play it more and more. any weapons, any tactics, all exist, and they will keep growing.community existed, and they are also keep growing too, and i am glad the community never dies even this game is lack of consistent updates. comnunity server is also fun if you want to play other than valve's official game mode like vsh, jailbreak, and theres many more you can explore.tf competitive existed too (community competitive server, valve's version is a bit... bad.) and even pro tf team & competitive match & series existed too, but this game is more to casual play, so you cant expect too much at comp, but hey, why not try it?i played this game for + hours, and it will keep growing until i can't play this game anymore. i have played like csgo, cod mw, bl and more fps stuff but i never stay in that game a very long time, and always go back to tf.i still remember when my rl friends calling me for playing this game. they say this game isbut they never tried it. they play more to ac, cod, bf and more high class fps, and i just play tf. now they stop playing those, meanwhile i still play this game even i have some hiatus by playing other game.conclusion, i personally think this game is the best game of the best game, and never makes me bored. if you want to always get excited and feel the bittersweet moments, then go for this game. i honestly couldn't think any better game than this.and still the best game since it's released.",1

13262,"this is a hard one to review, cause i really like the gameplay, and it really is quite tactical. but at the same time you fundamentally grind to win (or pay win).it's not about cosmetics here, the purchaces you make are to avoid grinding. and you have to grind to compete in this game, even just to progress in the pve.the game starts out easy, and you quickly see the potential of the combat system. but as you progress you'll see the importance of leveling your cards (or paying to level them fast) as your skill becomes increasingly irrelevant, and the strength and abilities starts to decide your victories instead.the game claims in it's decription that you can play against friends play with your friends in on virtual battles... but i have so far not seen any option to do so.instead the only option you really have is to grind and grind until you have the highest level cards, so that you can finally compete in pvp and finish pve with your skill as the deciding factor. (unless none of your opponents have high level cards, in which case you're just winning cause they haven't grinded or paid win yet.)the game also hosts lootboxes, which can be fun, but is none the less gambling, and ultimately abuses addictive personalities. not to mention how damaging a gambling addiction in general can be.whilst i do enjoy the gameplay, the game itself is build on this foundation of grind till you die or pay win.so i have to conclude that this game is ultimately bad for you, and not worth the small amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it.edit //: : (gmt +)i'm also fairly sure the game is riddled with fake reviews, cause almost every single top rated review is negative, yet the game is % positive... wat? they also seem to have a bot answering most of the reviews, just read how random each answer is, like an advertisement reply in every review.",0
2451,"the only arpg to rule them all. can be a fairly hard learning curve. when you first start this game you either hate it or love it. it all really depends what kind of person you are. your first character will practically always fail, and things can happen. you either get overwhelmed and can't get yourself to try again, or you can accept what happened and start up another character.(perhaps the same build tweaked or another one entirely) for strategists and rpg enthuisests this game is gold, over passive skill points to choose from with different classes on the same tree. meaning that there is no right class or right build.(although some builds can be much easier/harder then others). a very unique skill system with an equally unique crafting system only makes characters more diverse with every player. if your skeptical, why not go ahead and try it, it's free and has no paywin bs being shoved down your throat. if you love the game then you can buy microtransactions for cosmetic items, but isn't necassary at all. :)",1

10578,"if you like magic or other card games with some strategy and depth to them, i'd highly recommend checking this game out. this is a genuinely good fp card game that's worth your attention (or at least trying!), and i've been hooked since i've found it. it's a lot more fair on pricing and handing out cards than similar games (looking at you, hearthstone), and there's some genuinely cool mechanics that make use of the fact that this is a pc game without just making them all lol random effects (such as warcry).there's quite a bit of content here, including several campaigns and roughly puzzles to help you learn and mess with the mechanics in the game. plus you can do drafts, free gauntlets against the computer with interesting boss mechanics, and others.it might take you a bit of time to make the exact deck you want, but it's totally viable without spending money; and i think this is a quality enough game to spend a little on anyway as a thank-you to the devs for their hard work. hope you enjoy!",1

7351,"so... i've played this game for a measly hours, yet here i am, writing a negative review.first of all, i'm not hardcore into tcgs. i kinda like them but they're not my main gaming focus. i've tried dozens of tcgs, including classics like magic. but the one i mainly got stuck on was infinity wars, at least for some time. i dropped iw due to a massive lack of polish and then the occasional luckstomps. sure you can't avoid luckstomps entirely in games like this, but not losing a game due to gamebreaking bugs would be nice.in general i liked the gaming concept of iw however, and thus i came here thanks to steams recommendations.so what is my beef with es:l, so much so i feel i have to give the thumbs down and move on after a measly hours?let's talk lanes and targeting first. similar to iw, es:l has lanes (some very rare rounds have ). very unlike iw lanes here only roughly restrict your targeting. there is no pre-set attack order and turns are not simultaneous, so you can hit everything in your lane, but also the enemy if he/she doesn't have a unit with guard.some lanes also have rng effects which are nice at first, and simply annoying and pesky later.now the purpose of this is putting depth into card placements. basically the question is put your cards in the way of enemy team a or b? exploit effect a or b?effectively though this brings tons of problems with it, combined with the other factors. the balance between defending and rushing is extremely fragile, a bit of drawing luck from your enemy, a bit of misfortune from you, and a superior force will be gone in a single turn. and we're seriously not talking about skill here, just to be clear.not really fun to me.theres even one card that injures all of your units in one lane, then there's another that kills every injured unit in one lane, exacerbating this kind of problem. no caveat either, and not difficult to play. stuff like this seems to be rather common, and if you don't have a counter... tough. it's a key-lock situation. if you have the lock deck, get familiar with the location of the concede button. or prepare different decks for... well, anything and everything.next we have magicka, basically your summon resource.you use it to summon cards. that's it. no spending magicka to draw cards, no shuffling, nothing. so you have to keep up an adequate stream of cards by having other cards that allow you to draw more. obviously rngeezus is gonna have a couple words with you here.if you miss your curve, draw too many high cost cards early, or not enough later on, or even better both, have fun wasting half your magicka each turn. have an enemy with a bit of luck and watch him spam the livingout of you.even midway through the campaign it was common to have fights that were entirely based on rng, with the stampede swinging both ways. same deck, same strategy, some times i win with hp left easily, some times i lose with enemy having hp left and no chance from the beginning.oh, also the player that moves second gets a mana ring to make up for being late. i feel that's not quite balanced either and i've seen many people have the same problem.and really, at this point i don't even care about further pros or cons in the game since the main mechanics are not my definition of tcg fun.if you're prepared to dig through a seemingly unpleasant meta, and if you're prepared to face rngeezus himself. go for it.otherwise... pass this one up or be careful. or try infinity wars, it's not perfect but has the whole -lanes/summoning resources business down a whole hell of a lot better in my opinion.",0

10499,"i found this game before it came to steam. i played it. i loved it.i continued to play this game throughout the summer of .the main reason i loved this game was because of its community.the ages of people that play this range from to . (just a guess)and you may be thinking year olds? what is this? call of duty?.no.the kids in this game are friendly and don't use rude language towards your family or culture.every one else is just as much fun to play with.you can even add friends and message them.that is what hooked me on this game.i made a few friends and we would hunt mule deer, rabbits, moose, etc. every day.the community isn't huge, but is also isn't dead.there are competitions happening /, where hunters compete for the highest scoring animal hunted with specific weapons and in a specific location. winning one of these will award you with a trophie.there are also leaderboards showing peope,with the longest shot to kill whatever the animal, and highest scoring hunt of all time, etc..the game is incredibly beautiful, and you will often find yourself pulling out your camera (ingame) to take a photo and save it. the sounds of birds singing, and deers calling really make the wilderness scene come to life as you hunt for that mule deer buck.this is by far, the most realistic hunting sim out there.not just because of the graphics or the ambience of the game, but the gameplay.have you ever spent hours in real time hunting down a deer in a video game? i have.this isn't just a sit down, play for minutes and get off kind of game. not even close.grab a good book and get yourself a warm drink and wait. just wait in that tree stand + feet off the ground.wait. wait. wait.the only bad thing about this game is.. for free, you can only hunt mule deer. if you want to be allowed to hunt anything else, you must pay money. before you run off thinking that this is a pay to win. just try the game. you get the full feel of the game by just hunting mule deer. if you like it, then put some money towards the game and have even more fun hunting larger and/or smaller game.my overall rating for thehunter is. ./",1

14479,"product received for freeearly access reviewtl;dr: another veteran gets rambles on about the good ol' days of robocraft, and won't be returning even if they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.i have another ~ or so hours on their launcher, as well as the hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in early access. meaning, i've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.thing is, i can remember a time when i first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. however, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. this was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. just simple tdm all day every day.then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. so much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. spiderbots. spiderbots everywhere. sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but i remember more spiders than them.this was about the time i left for a few months, and came back to find megabots. oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. the megabots before the epic up with fj were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. the art bots i very much enjoyed were very squishy. the reason why was very simple: each block had different hp, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to nil if blown up. another way to drop the fps was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. the more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.that was a fun time, and i really do miss those days. what with grinding for tp (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. then grind for rp just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. that's right folks, i said tier, and there were of them, with megabots.each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. there was no wait ten seconds to be instantly healed, only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. sure. there were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the mega and not your sorrythen came the the pit, which was okay, i guess. never really got into it, and still don't. would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. however, they had their own set of problems. such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. there was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. i'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.afterwards came challenge battle, but i'm pretty sure its referred to as battle arena. again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. this also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. where one team with superior firepower would farm the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. they wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around reddit with this.really, though, this was a fun time to play robocraft, until the majour up everyone knows about. such as the removal of tiers (big mistake, fj), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called battle ranking. went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. then again, i stuck around just to see what else they did.what did they bring? why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of megabots. i love megas, and had two; one smg and one plasma. i miss them both, but fj doesn't want them, and if they say no, there's not a damn we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.folks, the thing is, i'm not going to recommend this game to anyone. if you want to try it out, go right on ahead. the game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying cs;go and other first person shooters with their loot crates. not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on reddit after all thispopped into existence. if they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. they've ed up real big this time.ps: at the time of this review, i've about three months of premium left on my account.",0

16321,"personally, i didn't enjoy this game. rather, it was more of a pain to play than fun. when i disassembled the ak- and m, they were so cool and very introcate. i enjoyed that bit, but then they introduced this exp system where i had to earn exp by doing moreâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥with the guns i've already destroyed. then on top of that, there's literally banners featuring their dlc for this game. at first, i thought i'd give this exp system a go, but then it instantly backfired on me because the tutorial was forcing me to do games with said ak- where i'd have to completely disassemble the entire weapon as fast as i could with no hints. must i remind you that this was litearlly no more than minutes of gameplay before they instantly expected me to remember how to completely disassemble the weapon and do it as fast as possible. this was just a nightmare for me because they added in even more parts to disassemble, which made me even more confused. oh, and did i mention that the ak- is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to disassemble? if it were with the pistol, i would have been a lot more comfortable, but no, they just had to stick me with the hardest weapon in the game to disassemble.look, if you're a guns expert and are too poor to buy real games on steam, then this is the perfect game for you. if you're a casual gamer who knows a few things about guns, then no, go away, you're going to have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing brain injury before you're done finishing this game. maybe it's because i'm impatient, but i'd rather have every single weapon there and already unlocked so that i could just shoot them, disassemble them, play with them on the fly instead of going through their hour long tutorial and having to waste even more time on the exact same weapons that i've already got done with just to unlock more weapons.",0

4437,"if you thoroughly enjoy mobile games, dont read this review tl;dr: this game is either a mobile port, or designed to be like one. enough said. i go into nitpicky, opinionated details further in the review. this game is not what i expected. unfortunately, this game is much worse than i expected. i saw this on the new releases section of the store homepage and instantly thought, you know, the last time i played yu-gi-oh was in th grade. i'd like to try it again. oh boy. this was a slap in the face to me, a teenager wanting to tap into my nostalgia of this card game that i loved when i was /. the first thing i noticed was that the game, which is rendered in a p window, had two sidebars blocked off with the yu-gi-oh! duel link logo printed on it. the only part of the screen you actually do things in is the center portion that has the dimensions of a phone in portrait mode. for me, it is beyond difficult to get through the tutorial battle because i can barely navigate through such a joke of a gui. it was then that i realized, this game was either a mobile port, or, for some stupid reason, designed to be played like a mobile game. no. just no. you don't put a mobile game of a beloved franchise and put it on steam. if you want to put a yu-gi-oh! game on steam, just make one intended for pc, mac, and linux that has no trace of mobile concepts (like that gems bs or the actual functioning resolution being limited to a phone screen). also, the recommended specs of this game are complete bs, an i and gtx for this? honestly, if you have a gtx , this is not the game to use its horsepower on. i strongly recommend that if you have any sort of dislike for mobile games or a desire to play a good yu-gi-oh game on a desktop platform, try to suffer through the lack of content on steam and look for something else online. also, the main starting screen in the park area looks similar to the one from the bakugan ds game, if anybody here ever played that.",0

15121,don't let the hours on record fool you. i've played this game for many hundreds of hours and enjoyed every minute of it. that is until the epic loot update which effectively removed everything fun about the game. robocraft used to allow players to save the ingame currency and work towards what they wanted. now all you can do is wish for luck in an endless grind likened best to gambling for hours with no return. this loot system is the only way to get ingame items and that being said you can never get what you want. do you have an idea for a great robot that you want to test? tough luck you'll have to hope that the freejam overlords look favorable upon you so you may or may not get the gear to make your bot. don't get the wrong idea i don't hate the game or the loot system. the problem is the ingame currency was removed meaning you cant get what you want anymore. this stunts creativity and disables one's ability to make the robots they want to. until the epic loot system is removed and or freejam restores the ingame currency i can not recommend this game to anyone and i will certainly not be spending my money on a company that doesn't care about its player base.edit : it has come to my attention that freejam is working to remove the epic loot system and restore teirs as well as removing the boost system! i will change the recomendation from no to yes if and when they follow through on their promises. i may even make this my main go to game who knows?,0

3053,"the greed of these devs has always been impressive. they do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. at tier and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.and worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. so once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.with ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.but of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.coming back to the game, i wanted to try out this new pve tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. the problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. and to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.on top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total a . rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. in air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have - times the weaponry. in ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. in naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0

9971,"as you can tell from my hours, i have played this game quite a bit. i'm gonna go for an unbiased review of this, but it may end up being a tad bit biased without me realizing it. without further ado, i'm gonna just jump right in.pros: . fun (but occasionally repetitive) gameplay . decent graphics and visual effects . really nice character design and backstories . great diversity in combat styles for certain characterscons: . slightly pw . certain overpowered classes (looking at you cra and die) . terrible economy . moderately buggy at times . the majority of the pvp community is bad (this one is a bit of a gripe but it still remains true)these sum up most of the major points, but there is a lot more to go in detail about. first things first, if you wanna play this game seriously, it's pretty much unavoidable to not spend money at some point. it won't be too much, but the major thing that's locked behind a paywall is the skill slot change medal. when you start out, you only have skill slots, and getting that medal unlocks the other . it's $ worth of k-ching to buy it, and even though you won't need it for some, the majority of classes benefit greatly from it, with some needing it as a necessity. there are some events that will give you a free permanent medal, but those don't happen too often, so you would probably end up waiting several months for one of those events. besides that, there's nothing else you need to spend money on, although it's pretty obvious they made the skill quests extremely grindy to push you towards just buying the skill you need instead of doing the respective quest(s) for it. the quest for most second job changes takes quite a bit as well, taking as long as a couple of weeks for people who play casually (note: this does not include all nd job changes quests). as for the rest of the game, even though there are some negatives, the gameplay makes it worth it. it's really fun to play, and even though there's a pretty sharp learning curve that happens around level , that's what makes it fun. even replaying through the various areas as different characters, levelling them up can prove a completely different experience depending on which classes you've played already.graphics: soundtrack: .gameplay: .bugs: overall: verdict: even though there are some definitely noticeable flaws, the pw factor isn't too high and it's worth at least a shot in my eyes.",1

10486,"do not read the negative reviews. please read this first. this is a very good hunting game. as a real life hunter, i enjoy the level of realism this game provides. it's not realistic in many ways, but it's not a hunting sim (even though i wish it was). that being said, it's certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market. it has a wide variety of environments, weapons, species, and equipment. it has incredible graphics, good ai, awesome online multiplayer, real-time competitions, interesting missions, decent skill system with acheivements, a photo gallery of your kills, and decent statistics tracking. the gameplay is fun while remaining somewhat realistic, but it does have a learning curve. once you understand how the game works, you'll have a blast. the negative reviews almost all come from people who did not read what they were downloading. they thought this was a completely free game without doing any research into it. thehunter does have a subscription based system and microtransactions, but it's not all bad. they just updated their fp model and it is more than fair now. keep reading.as i write this review, currently there are maps, huntable species, and one species of dog you can bring hunting with you. when you download the game for free as a guest you are able to access all maps. however, you can only hunt species for free (whitetail deer, pheasant, and three rabbit species). the free species are on all but one map. all other species require a license that you can either earn by doing missions for in-game currency (gm$) or buy with real money (em$). you can even earn em$ by doing sponsor deals (which i have not done, so i can't tell you whether or not i recommend it). you cannot shoot animals you don't have a license for. you are given two weapons (ga single shot shotgun and . bolt-action rifle with unlimited ammo) and a few other items for free to start your hunting. this shotgun is legal for every species in the game as long as you're using the correct shells (birdshot, buckshot, or slugs), the rifle is legal for mid-sized animals including the whitetail. check the wiki for more information.between the missions for the free species, you can earn plenty of gm$ to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chances of being successful, and even buy licenses for additional species. that's all without spending any real money. this route should be considered more of a demo to the full game, as it teaches you about the basics of what the game has to offer. once you're convinced that the full version is worth the money, you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription. subscribers unlock all animals, maps, and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription. bundles are the best value if you're just getting into the game, however. bundles include a subscription and a host of weapons and equipment. i would highly recommend the trailrunner bundle ($.), which includes a year's subscription and a host of weapons and equipment. when your year's subsription is ending, you can renew your subscription for another full year for only $.. there are tons of extra weapons and equipment you can buy a-la-carte with em$ (real money). i've spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and i don't regret it. i love hunting and this is the best hunting game out there. you don't have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though. you can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for $.. the subscription is fair and necessary because the devs are constantly updating the game and adding new maps, species, and other features. even if you don't want to spend money on the game, you can download what is a great free whitetail deer hunting game.before you go trashing a great game, do some research on what you're actually getting into. it is not fair at all to the devs or long-time players who want this game to be supported for years to come. there is a wiki and forum for learning and getting involved in thehunter's great community. happy hunting, all. thehunter wiki[www.thehunterwiki.com]thehunter forums[forum.thehunter.com]trailrunner bundle",1

14124,"well, the controversy around the warz titles should be ehnough of a reason for you to never pick this game up ever, allow me to give some details on this build.the menus music and loading screen music are simply awful, like i mean really bad. can't rebind controls (atleast not in game) weapons are weak. in general.clunky controls.market system is unpolished and confusing.animations are yucky.picking up and dropping things is stinky.final verdict: / - puts the d in down syndrome.also: op productions (the devs of the last yuck games) sold out their ip to fredaikis ab. (btw the leader of this compaines account on steam, has a vac ban, so whatever that means to you.), however underneath the publisher tab on the steam store page, it cleary says op productions, and if you click on iut, it brings you to games op worked on, that includes this game.so anyone saying its a new dev team, don't be so harsh its a new team behind it, so don't judge it is simply blind or misinformed. i am sure they have a very large hand in what happens to this game. he also has a vac ban, and has had a history of making cheat engines. which is needless to say, a red flag. in conclusion: if you are years old, have no money, can't play/aren't good ehnough to play dayz, or want something to play for minutes while you install a better game, this is for you.",0
6602,"just going to throw this out there first off, some reviews are actually corret. after reading about a page or two of reviews i decided to try it regardless, thinking it might be a knock-off battlefield .. and it kind of is in some sense. it was fun at first until you reach rank and then it all changes. it turns into a completely pay win game. you do not stand a chance if you do not own tanks / planes (pilots & tank crew men) along with anti-tank / vehicle weapons. maybe it was just me trying to stay loyal and play with only my us troop when germany is clearly stacked and gets a lot more benefits in the war such as two spawning points, more lives, and their guns seem slightly better in general.all in all i give this game a /.it has / had a lot of potential but as most fp fps games it falls on pw in the end.. or really in the near start. so enjoy your rank - trial then don't bother unless you've got money to throw away.",0

4824,"this was once one of, if not, my favorite games. the base concept of the game is amazing. it is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. the problem lies within the developer, hirez (or titanforge whatever they are called now).if i had to give this game a rating on just the base game and how fun it is, i'd give it a ./yes, i still play very frequently. but it's only ever with my friends and never alone. i have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but i don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. i've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. i've simply learned too many things and played so much that i would say that i am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.the matchmaking is just a joke. honestly. i don't need to say more than that. matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get yourpushed in.there are very frequent patches, one or two a month. a new god is also released everyone .-ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. the problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for litearlly years. yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since and was fixed only recently. years! and even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in seconds or something like that.the skins in this game are amazing to be fair. they look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. there's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire year.again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. certain gamemodes like siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. the game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.it's also frustrating that this year hirez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on mixer instead of twitch. this is when i realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on mixer than there would be on twitch. not to mention that the smite world championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to smite through twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.i think i have put more time into this game than any other game i have ever played. i love this game, but i cannot stress how terrible it feels to play it. i enjoy it far less and sometimes i'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. i feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. i have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest. the problem is that i am in the majority.overall, i just couldn't reccommend this game to anyone in the current state that it is in. i have k+ hours on steam alone but i played before it was even on steam. i love this game so much, but hirez is not a good company for smite. they don't know what they are doing.thanks for reading my rant lmao",0

14966,"this is probably the most dissapointing game i've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. this includes overpowered weapons that shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, i could go on for hours.the largest problem i've encountered is players attaching a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. this mainly occurs with the new aeroflak cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.secondly the insane cost of items. so you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe money. now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. so, you play another match...but there's someone with an aeroflak, by the way did i mention that the aeroflak costs , to buy?but thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs , to buy, and i bet that leaves you wondering but how do i get that? well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending more money.anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.this has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? well other than costing a ton of money (a single day costs â£) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. all of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?/ huge dissapointment",0

11121,"after playing both magic the gathering and hearthstone, i have to say eternal card game (ecg) game is a great blend of the two.although i loved mtg for its in-depth strategy, fun limited drafting style and the game mechanics, the reality is that the game is expensive and takes a lot of time to enjoy. hearthstone landed on the other end of the spectrum: it was cheap, easy to play but lacked the depth that mtg had.eternal card game has blended the two very well and is a fantastic edition to the space. the free to play mechanic is awesome; it is easy to amass a large number of cards that you can then use to build a competetive deck while enjoying the game without feeling like you are grinding. the ai is good albeit easy to beat if you undersatnd how it makes decisions.also, competeive multiplayer drafting is really well done in ecg and requies the amount of thought/skill of a mtg draft.for players who are not used to in-depth, mechanic and strategy heavy ccg, this game does have a much steeper learning curve than a game like hearthstone. however, the pay off is very rewarding.",1

10426,"note: thehunter is a niche game. it's a wonderful niche game, don't get me wrong. but other than the gameplay itself, i have nothing but issues with it. compare this game to the big name games out there... cod, bioshock, farcry, skyrim and so forth... ignore the genre. production value and sales are what i'm comparing here. in all of these big name games have one thing in common. you buy the game, you can play it. all of it. you unlock gear and items as you play through. you don't have to buy additional junk just to complete missions/progress through the game. occasionally you will have expansions or add-ons, more dlc that you can buy that will in most cases extend the gameplay, but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind. so, i'll take cod, one of the best known, most loved, and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry. i think i paid $ when it first came out. that was it, for the whole game, all equipment, all levels and weapons attainable for that $. oh, i forgot to mention that you own the game at that point, you don't have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content. now, thehunter. free to play? no, it's not mistitled. it's deceptively titled. the fp portion conains one rifle, one scope, a bleat call, a camera, a gps and binoculars. oh, that's fine and all, but you only get to hunt one animal (mule deer) on one reserve. if anything, it's a free demo. if you expect to see the rich content in this game, forget it. this demo is nothing more than a snapshot. ok,... so that's what you've gotten for free. let's spend $ on this game, like we would any other, and see where it gets us. $ for one year basic, and another $ for three more months. that's it. that's what you get. i would love to say that you get more, but you don't. you get months, with no additional gear, no additional weapons. oh, you do get the option to hunt on all the reserves. you also gt the licences to hunt all of these animals. but you still can't because you haven't bought the proper weapons, proper ammo, proper equipment... so you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out $ for months of play time. what's that? did i just hear someone squeak the words world of warcraft? denied. wow at least gave you access to all of it's content after you've paid your subscription. and no, i'm not going to complain about the subscription, as wow is/was an mmo. gotta maintain those servers. yeah, i know thehunter has multiplayer. big deal. out of the people who enjoy multiplayer, thehunter could loose all of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only. you guys want to make more money? add the cottontails and a crappy shot gun to the free to play version, and call it a free demo. sell the game for $, and monthly membership of $. make gear and weapons unlockable. get rid of the microtransaction garbage. i would buy this game for $. i would pay a $ subscription, if i had access to all of the games content after i made those purchases. that's at least $ you guys would have made from my first month. $ and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription. however, due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game, i've spent $ for the subscription, had my fill becasue i refuse to spend more money on trivial, and temporary purchases, and that's it. you've made $ from me, and you won't make any more. i don't recommend this game. sure, download it, shoot a few mule deer, and call it quits. for the price you'll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases, (subscription/consumables) this game isn't worth the disk space it occupies. even with wow, purchased when it was released, and played for the first year at about $ is still cheaper than this. you want a good hunting game? play cod, or farcry, or bioshock. you get to hunt people and monsters, you get tons of weapons to choose from, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription, and your purchases are yours to keep!! don't spend a dime on this game.",0

4102,"after spending countless hours into this game, i feel i am ready to give my side of a review.yugioh has been a trend ever since the anime show of yugioh, plus people (like us) duel with cards like in this game. it's a very fun concept duel where player vs another player duel against each other, using monsters, traps, and spell cards. it's one of those games that makes it very fun to play and still. this game is originally from mobile. now i will get to the most detailed part:when you start the game, you have legendary duelists you can start off with, seto, or yugi. picking any doesn't impact further into the game, because you will eventually unlock more new legendary duelists by completing missions. what's great is most cards are very balanced, however, the downside is cutting traps/spells, and monster zones from the original mat, but you still have graveyard, field zone, extra zone for your fusion monsters.you can compete against the world, duel with your friends, buy card packs available to buy(hope you score better cards), customize your decks, your card and mat layouts. there's alot you can do. oh, did i mention you mobile users can transfter your data to your pc? well, now you can! if you don't wanna drain your phone battery by playing duel links, well, you can play it on your pc instead!in conclusion, i would truly recommend this game to any yugioh fans out there. despite not having monster zones and trap/spell zones, each isn't half bad. give this game a try, you won't be disappointed!",1

5146,"this game is smash bros., but it's not... first of it's many differences from smash bros, is that your legend only starts with unarmed attacks. these are weak but can be very fast attacks. ( good for rabbit punches, almost litterally )then you see a generic icon that looks like a flaming sword stuck in the ground. this is a random weapon pick-up spot. if you grab this you will get one of your legend's weapons, which include, spears, guns, dual daggers, hammers, rocket lances, and swords. these do more damage than your unarmed attacks. some attack faster and more powerful than others. now here is the equivalent of a special. every character has special attacks, with each weapon respectively. some are ranged and some are close range. the graphics are kind of cartoony, and are really fun! (you can tell the devs had fun making this game) there are also bombs, kind that explodes on contact, that is kind of like a sticky bomb that will explode when touched, or after a certain time limit. there is also a horn that summons your mechatronic valkerie, which flies in with a weapon, and on fire hitting your enemies. the music is fitting for the arenas and not bad.and when you win ( or lose ) there is a chat box, in which you can say gg or hacker!!! or laaag, pretty much whatever you want... people just log out anyhow... :[ it's still a good feature!all in all i looove < < < < this game!!!just apply for the beta, just do it!

(later i will do that and update this review).---conclusion: very good fp game, but i can't recommend it yet because of #, # and # major cons. i will change to recommended as soon they fix and balance more the game (i'm have a good feeling about the next patchs).",0

4082,"yu-gi-oh! duel links is a port from mobile phones that is done very well. keeps they layout the mstly the same, excpet it adds more to make to make it different from the mobile version. the steam version adds two bars on the sides of where the game is played that help with format and being able to easily select and then read about a card you've selected on the left side. the right side will either have all the cards you can add to your deck when customizing your deck or show a log of the current duel you're in. aside from the differences between the mobile version and this version, this game plays wel and is the most addicting mobile game i've played. i can play it for hours, and considering there's always a way to duel, you can play as long as you want. while you can run out of the default ai characters in the duel world to fight until they come back after a set period of time, there's still more way to duel. you can either duel legendary duelists in the duel world gate using gate keys you collect, which is extrememly easy, or you can play either ranked or unranked pvp as long as you want. duel links is also very friendly to newcomers to the card game itself. the duel school in the game provides the opportunity to quiz you on your skills as a duelist and helps you learn a lot from this. you even get rewarded for doing these with gems, the in-game currency. the in-game currency known as gems are very easy to obtain and you can get a decent amount of rare, super rare, and ultra rare cards within a reasonable amount of time. there are also in-game purchases that seems pretty fair. i' not a huge fan of microtransactions, but duel links isn't too bad with them. there are also sales on card boxes constantly that make it even cheaper to get even more if that is your thing. while this is the speed dueling version of yu-gi-oh, it is still fun to play, it just leaves you without certain opportunities such as tuner cards, xyz cards, or pendulum cards. however, this is still very fun to play, and it's even more fun if you have friends to duel against. while this app isn't perfect of course, it is still very fun and adicting and i would suggest to anyone, new player or veteren, to give this game a try.",1

2503,"it has turned so much worse over the last years.i joined the game before .the game was fun in the begining...at first i said to myself:'well, i'll wait until i figured out how to play properly before eventually paying some bucks for a premium account.but soon i got it: gaijin just wants user to pay for premium vehicles or quick-repairs (prem. account)... without any benefit from it. a prem. account just means you can place more badges to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lions after a match, (= in-game-money to pay your repairs if you get shot).that's what i'd call 'free to play - pay to win'. special ammo or repairs will cost you silver lions so basically real money.if you really are mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assured: you'll get affronted to the fact that russian vehicles (planes or tanks) are the greatest in the world. no one can defeat their armor or aigility. is this true? i can't find any wiki article that confrims that russian technique was outstanding back in the days. it was unreliable and let's say: their planes were bad compared german planes.that's why i'd call the dev's: liars. but wait... there's even more:gaijin is just announcing new stuff, which is incompletely developed and balanced.old issues about bad balancing and bad realism aren't corrected. the only thing you'll feel in newer versions of the game is that russian vehicles are getting stronger...to my mind, this game is basically a russian propaganda machine.. and about the worst issue:gaijin claims that there ain't no cheaters in the game it is not possible, they say that everything regarding balancing is calculated by the servers.well... dozens of youtube videos prove that - yes it is true, there are cheaters.so my conclusion: gaijin is just another software company with the objective to gain money. but in this case, they lie to their community in every respect. they don't wanna care about fair -play (avoiding cheats) or realism.don't waste your time.",0

2664,"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. although, it is free! ... -ish.being an old starfox veteran, i got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.then, gradually, i progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. this was fun, too, for a while. but then i started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. get used to these head-on collisions. they happen a lot. and not just with enemies. sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'f**king rammer nb' for your trouble. lovely.my main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. so the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because of them will be chasing bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.i get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in world of tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. however, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. so, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. however, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.they will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, i'm not convinced.sorry, warthunder. you only get / golden badger eggs. :(",0

15486,"update:after a crazy number of hours spent on this game, i quit due to the poor design choices made when implementing legendary items. the game became horribly imbalanced and no longer fun to play as the core mechanism, tweaking formations, was replaced by pw. horribly disappointing turn of events for a formerly great game.original review:this game really surprised me. it\'s an incredibly simple concept, your crusaders are walking along, enemies show up, and they kill them, gold drops, you level up, ad nausium. the game designers have managed to turn it into a surprisingly deep bit of strategy with combinations of gear, formations, abilities, missions, etc that all interact so that no experience of the game is the same until much later when you\'ve got most of the gear and the math begins to flatten out.the time recorded in game is a bit deceptive, as i leave it running in the background. actual interaction time is far lower, that said it\'s an epic grind to get all the campaigns completed and will likely take you months or years of on-off play unless you shell out lots of $$$. it won\'t win any awards for exciting action, but it\'s a fun little game to play at work in - minute spurts",0

6221,"this game confuses me. because it isn't badly done.it's a fp game, but it's mostly payavoidgrind. there are some pw elements to it, but i've not noticed them have any significant impact on the game. you gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly. i was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing. the interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun isn't actually bad. infact, it's pretty good. you're essentially a metal box of anti-infantry that can park in any barn you want. it works well and you don't feel crapped on from above just because you're not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash.the weapons are heavily customisable and they actually make a difference. i have an smg that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it. wonderful thing since i'm such a crap shot.you can also steal bicycles and give people backies. which is clearly a major selling point.the game itself is very basic, there's not much to it. it's a ww shooter which feels to me like day of defeat on battlefield sized maps. but it's nothing special, just a shooter.but it has me hooked, i've no idea why. the game is average but the fact that it's a fp game that doesn't feel like i'm forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point. i could use a bigger tank, sure. you gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks. but i don't want to, because everything in this game, from basic gear to bigger gear has it's place.i'm still confused as to exactly what it is about this game i like. maybe it's just simply because it's hitting all the right notes for a fp game that wants to include a pw element but doesn't feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it. maybe it's because the game is barebones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way?or maybe it's just because i can steal some american's bicycle for the glorious fatherland.",1

8124,"after playing over hours of this game i can say: no dont download this game! the main issue on pc is the lack of good and new content; not redone old content, and unstable servers. the game is not pay to win at all; it's true that refinement items can be purchased through the cash shop but, if you try to purchase all the refinement items that you would need; you'd go broke! it costs so much to get anything in this game maxed out; you might aswell play the game and take your time. but that avalability of the items in the cash shop makes people (and by people i mean trolls and half-wits) a reason to spam in zone chat. it should also be said that the devs have done a good job working with what they have in the game; but after the masive bleed out after mod ; no one was left to spend money on the game and keep it going on pc; but, now its on the xbone and they have some safety in revinue; alowing the pc to be the testing ground for new content. i do hope that the game would regain lost players and start growing once again but, this is just the hope of a long time player. if the devs ever do see this i have some words of advice; make new content of quality! it doesnt have to tie into a masive modle; it can just be a themed dungeon (like water, fire, air, or earth to tie into modle or maybe raiding a massive bandit encampment if you want unrealated conent) with - bosses, some new loot, and even a random puzzle. just some end game content that feels new; you have a strong dev team that can pull content out of theirif they wanted to; even if you can make new textures you can reuse assets in new content, just aslong as we can have a new dungeon with new bosses and loot to run. this is what keeps players going new loot and more end game content. you could take a look at another game; path of exile, a game with one of the best cash shop intergrations ever. i cannont tell you how much i want transmogs for my gear. making your charicter look good is a very important thing. look at wow; people run dungeons from years ago for loot to transmog thier gear. if you dont want to add new loot because of balance but, want to add a new dungeon, just add in transmogs. thank you for reading this massive wall of text!",0

12498,"i didn't like re for a while and avoided purchasing any of the content but this game has come a long ways and sector studios has really changed the game around.first off the free to play portion of the game is more like a demo/base portion of the game. there are around free cars and tracks. this lets you try the game out and see if you like it. you purchase content (cars, tracks, packs, and experiences) based on what you want. you don't have to buy everything and most people don't.the packs are always discounted and go on sale frequently. any content you have also gets discounted from packs and experiences.experiences are basically full games that run through the base game of raceroom. (so the dtm and adac gt experiences.)all the content i own i got on sale and i got dtm and wtc for free! i won these through the free competitions that are held in raceroom. they cycle through these competitions around each month. some are just for bragging rights and some have rewards such as the in game currency (vrp), game content, or even real race tickets.i have all the other big sims and i like raceroom for providing content that the other don't and also providing real race series with the tracks they race on. you can compete on the leaderboards with real race drivers in the dtm and adac gt series and they even host races with them from time to time.i definitely recommend trying it out and seeing if you like it. if you do, i suggest waiting for one of the sales either through raceroom or on steam, like the summer sale :).",1

4098,"introductionwow... this is actually really good! this is an actual game... from konami... year /. it's great, definitely worth a try... i still can't believe this is a game from konami o.onotesit should be said straight away that duel links doesn't function exactly like the ocg/tcg of yu-gi-oh! the major changes here are...only spell/traps and monster zones. there are cards from the vanilla yu-gi-oh! and gx series at this point in time. duelists have abilities, such as kaiba has a perk that can magically start the game with a field spell.positivesthe game is designed to be taken with around with you. everything you do in this game, with the exception of a miss play, rewards you. you can earn boosters and cards relatively easy. the more you play, the more gems and gold you earn. considering the amount of time* i've spent playing this game, i still have not spent real-world money. the game is designed to have your data uploaded and downloaded to and from your mobile and pc devices. this allows you to play at home, from one pc to another and on your mobile when travelling. this feature is fantastic. you can play against anyone in the world. i've played against south koreans, japanese, australians, new zealanders, taiwanese, germans and many more! everything, except global chat, is in your selected language. thus, allowing you to play against anyone in the world. microtransactions can be very reasonable, such as booster packs + high rarity card (depending on box) guarenteed for . usd. boosters are obtained from boxes. each box tells you exactly what is inside it and offers yopu a chance at everything. this means, the more boosters you obtain from that box, the higher your chances are at getting a specific card inside. unlike the tcg of yu-gi-oh! where a modern box guarentees you only secret rares and the set contains secret rares in total. the box, in duel links, offers you a chance at everything. i very much like this. the pvp in this game is very friendly and fun, definitely recommend everyone play this especially when you can play as many times as you want. the game is designed for a pc(?) i guess more on that in the negatives section. the left and right panels of the application provide lots of information in respect to the duel and card being viewed.*(note steam only checks time played using the steam version)negativeslike all games there are negatives, some small, others big. in this case, i mainly target some of the microtransactions and the game port itself. the game was designed for mobile deivces using the ios and android operating systems. the steam version however... has panels. the middle panel of your screen feels incredibly claustrophobic. the entire game runs on this small verticle mobile like screen. i almost uninstalled this game because of how awkward it felt at first during the tutorial. the graphics conparison from my mobile device to the steam version is laughable. not because of the d or d art, oh no. i'm referring to the laughably obvious and hideous jaggies. the cards on the steam version have no basic anti-aliasing when they are transposed/transformed/rotated. the microtransactions for some of these boxes using real-world currency is frieghtening. . usd for packs from a pack box is nasty. especially when... every booster only comes with cards. not , or . no matter how big or small the box is, booster or boosters. you only get cards in each booster. this is fine with the small boxes, but a long grind for th bigger boxes. the card trader comes whyen you get to stage . between the time i played, i had no idea what the gold currency was used for. too many currencies. i hate games that throw too many currencies in the game. in duel links the currencies we have are gems, gold, many different portal keys, every attribute, that includeds spell and traps, rarities, tickets, coins(?) and more that i definitely forget about. i have no idea why these even exist and who thought they were a good idea.",1
4607,"one of the most toxic player bases in the moba genre and that's with games like lol and dota with people telling others to kill themselves every game. however those games have the advantage of being good. kudos to smite for having varied game modes. and the third person perspective really changes up the formular. the game is serviceable - if you're willing to ignore the games glairing fault. its community. today for example i played games throughout the day. of which i was told to kill myself. had someone allude to my sexuality being less than favourableand other games devolved into petty name calling and sh*tposting rather than playing the game. the vast majority of players will throw games if you dont let them win their way.in a world where other, better, studios are taking big steps to fix their community. hi rez seem far more occupied with making questionably infringent copies of other games whilst not taking the time to help the community grow healthly. before you ask. yes these people were reported. no nothing happened. good times were had with this game. but playing this with other people makes me concerned for my own sanity. thus making it impossible to recommend this game to anyone. i had to warn a friend who was starting to be careful of people probably telling her to kill herself if she didn't play 'the right way'. she stopped playing soon after when i was proven right within mere moments of the warning.gameplay - /game itself -/",0

(could also mean you need to train more in it.)the best thing i like is the unlocking and defenitly the weapons. every character can use two different ones from the start. i believe they can use more later. what is nice with it, are the light and heavy attacks. every light attack is the same with every character, but the heavy's differ. this goes for every weapon a character can use! this way there is something femiliar and something different to try out with every character and they're starting weapons. besides this, the non weapon fighting does not change. every character has the same non weapons moves.",1

3614,"team fortress is a very decent racing game. first of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like heavy, soldier, and scout. the vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the heavy is the slowest, the scout is the fastest, and the medic is normal speed.classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. the medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. this will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the solider, is faster than the medic.the level design is beautiful, but take two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. but some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as fort, but there is no finish line,the fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. for example, the heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. it seems similar to mario kart, with the various courses and powerups. however, it fails to capture the fun of mario kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and blandthe major flaw in tf is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. there are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. valve did include a map that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. these maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.while the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. i wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this pc-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.",1

8266,"do you like grinding? how about repetitive actions? a cumbersome ui? an unengaging story? a prohibitively expensive in-game cash shop? if these things sound like fun, you'll love neverwinter.yes, the game is free to play, but so was dungeons and dragons: eberron unlimited, and that is a far superior d&d title. neverwinter fails to reproduce the classic party-based gameplay that the original pen & paper games had, and instead elects to replace them with repetitive and formulaic mmo mechanics.the game looks nice visually, but that's pretty much all it has going for it. it still doesn't look as nice as, say, guild wars , another mmo that is superior to this game in every way. granted, guild wasr is not entirely free-to-play, but i'd still much rather pay a hefty one-time fee for a quality game than pay nothing for a game that is sub-par).also, this game seems to favor those who have plenty of time - or are filthy rich - and nobody in between. i really wanted to try the dragonborn race, for example, but shelling out the $ usd (!) needed to unlock it was absolutely unreasonable. yes, i know that there is a currency exchange that allows people to convert in-game currency into the money-bought currency, but no, i do not have the time or the willpower to grind that out.i'll be honest, i did not get anywhere close to the end-game content, nor did i try out the foundry feature which seemed like an interesting idea, but unfortunately the game did not grab me the way i hoped it would and i felt like i was simply wasting my time playing it. there are worse mmo's out there, but i can't understand why anyone would play this game over other, better choices out there, especially since eberron: unlimited already exists and is a superior d&d mmo title.",0

14675,"the gameplay isn't very good to begin with, the matchmaking is completely unbalanced, crafting your robot is even ruined with the terrible rng crate system, which was either put in place in an attempt to make the game worse or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what is essentially gambling. on top of that is the premium membership, which ties in with the crate system and the crafting system to squeeze out even more money from its player base. premium membership isn't a one time buy, it requires a subscription like an mmo. the subscription options range from a few days to six months. after every match you get a crate with some items. better types of crates have a higher chance for rarer items, you get better crates from being higher on the scoreboard and on the winning team in a match. you get more items per crate depending on the type of match you play. match types that generally take longer give more items. the items you get are completely random. and if you're not a premium member you only get half of the items per crate, so if you happen to get a good item in a locked off row and you're not premium, it's gone. this is of course meant to encourage people to pay for premium, but it's more likely to just drive players away from the game.even with premium (which i had for days) you mostly get garbage, even after hours and hours of grinding the same poorly balanced match types over and over again. there is a way to get more crates without grinding for hours though, of course you can buy them with real life money. so if you want to get a lot of items, some of which would hopefully be good, you can pay for a few days of membership, then pay for several of the highest tier crates, then hope you get something you actually want. on top of that most of the paint colors are restricted to premium members only. so if you want to paint your robot anything other than white, dark gray, light blue, and orange, then you've got to pay for premium.of course you don't have to pay for anything, you could go on just playing the game. but that leads to the worst part yet. the game play. the movement feels clunky and the combat is bad. by that i mean weapons, at least the ones you start with, have terrible accuracy, especially at long range. this can still be sort of enjoyable when you're up against robots with similarly weapons, but like i said there's no balance in the matchmaking. any weapon/part goes for any game mode. they only match based on the robot's cpu score. each item has a cpu cost, stronger/rarer weapons have a slightly higher cpu cost than weaker basic weapons. however if you build your robot with just the basics, like a helicopter rotor attached to a powerful missile launcher (the missiles lock on by the way) or a rail gun to a few blocks flat on some wheel's/treads/whatever, you can easily get matched with new players using robots with much weaker weapons which most likely can't even hit you reliably from the range you're hitting them. another common annoyance is people using small, fast robots which hover or fly around you firing some sort of homing weapons, which mean their robot can constantly be moving quickly and erratically while always hitting you because they don't have to worry about aiming. and even if you do land a lucky hit, they'll just heal fully if they don't get hit again within ten seconds. while you probably won't be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapons constantly chipping away at you. the only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assuming you have the parts. even if you did though, does that seem like fun? a bunch of people just mindlessly flying around holding down the left mouse button until one team wins. not exactly great gameplay.even if all of that sounds good to you, the only way to get better weapons and parts is to keep playing these poorly balanced matches over and over again for hours till you hopefully get the parts you want/need. or until you get enough garbage to “recycle” for anything from less than % to about % or % of what each of your items is worth (destroying your items in the process of course) then finally getting enough in game currency from all that crap you spent all that time grinding for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive items from the in game shop. you can do all of that to see if maybe the game gets a bit more enjoyable. or you can just play a different game.",0

5693,"dcs world is by far the best flight sim i've ever played. there was a brief moment, as i was climbing through some clouds, i felt as though i were actually flying. its hard to explain, but it was exhilirating. getting to shoot down enemy migs, and blow things up is purely a bonus. i recently purchasesd the f- sabre, mainly because of the variety of weapons it can carry. the mig- was a tempting option, because of its cool cockpit, and big cannons. it was a tough choice. the mig can out climb the sabre, and has bigger guns. the f- presented a pretty convincing argument with it's six machine guns, and air-to-air misiles. i kept thinking about all the combat footage i've seen where an inexperienced mig pilot would try to out turn a missile, only to have it fly right up his tail pipe. the radar gunsight makes you feel like you are on the cutting edge of modern technology. it's a little tricky to get the hang of the pipper reticle, but once you do, you'll be splashing migs left and right. it's the precurser to the gunsights that are responsible for the air superiority we enjoy today, and the reason we boasted a to kill ratio over korea. i love being in the pilot seat, and reliving a part of history. it seems i have made the right choice. i'm having a blast making up my own missions in the mission editor, and then seeing them play out in a realistic environment. the aircraft, vehicles, water and terrain are beautifully rendered. the physics are superb! i plan to eventually get each and every plane. i would highly recommend dcs world to anyone who loves flying. try the free download. i guarantee you'll be glad you did.",1

4277,"in short: pay to win game. (pay to get much better cards that can flat you out like truck hitting a bug)it's fun and gameplay really based on your own style. however, in order to win, you need to have the best cards, at least much better than your opponent. so basically to obtain these cards manually is to use your own money or obtainable hardly thru in-game diamond currency (obtainable). it seems very unfair when someone has or better card than you, easily destroys well planned strategy just because they have that one card no one has obtained. point is you need very good card in order to win another player. your basic or normal cards wont do. but the thing is you can get those cards by pouring as much money as you want to obtain fast and easy cards, then you can win against other players who have less good cards than yours.in a word: its a bit pay to win if you play for competitive mode (against real players) but if you play casually, for fun or nostalgic visits, this game might be good. warning : there's a difference when fighting versus npc and player. there will be a huge gap. fighing npc is like fighting a toddler who knows nothing and very straightforward. whereas fighting real player is like you fighting a world championship ufc fighter where they use combos to beat you down and you cant doabout it, and because your gloves are made of cotton and his are made of spiky steel and will beat you down and you will be stunned all the way.",0

1883,"i'll give a thumbs up only because the game itself is pretty good, but this is not an actual review, it’s more like a short summary about my over hours spent into this game (lol nb can’t write until kh noob). i started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum i post on play this. so i started playing it both with my friends and solo. today at the end of my very last match(which i lost) i realized that i have never had fun in this game. i mean, out of hours i can only remember like, - really funny moments where i actually laughed.oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. i was earthshaker top dire in lane with warlock against death prophet and batrider, we got first blood like seconds after the : mark, i spotted dp warding our jungle, i used fissure to block her escape way and warlock used shadow word. while we were aa her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early xvi century in france, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes i know, my interests are ed up), and that actually made me laugh, that to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that dp started dancing while we were beating her up. this made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! focus!there's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, mmr, trench tier match; me without blink until :; our drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of pc problems, lina with aghanim and no meka; wards only for half match(i'm guilty of it too); we lost roshan two times, over kills of difference for the radiants, lina and storm spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul don't evel let me start on that one, and so on.at the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to ff gg wp ez qq ms ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between lina and storm, i asked myself some questions: am i having fun? is this game making me laugh? how many funny moments i can remember about this game? is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <kh scum nb)? the answers to the questions were: no, no, not even , i don't know. in that instant, i realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. how many times have i actually enjoyed what was going on on screen? why am i taking this so seriously? why do i want to win so desperately? why do my teammates want to win so desperately?...how many times have i smiled while playing this game?...these are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! this makes me sad. i've heard yelling my whole life, i play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. games really help me, they help me a lot. please, guys, stop, don’t get mad, i’m serious! this is a game, right? games are meant to be fun! please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, it’s not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! it’s just a videogame! enjoy the little things you can get out of it! remember dp dancing to death? wasn't that fun? remember pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? and then the radiants team wiped us? yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? sorta fun? even a little bit? yes we lost this match but c’mon! don't hide in the fountain! let’s do something silly to them! let’s annoy them! storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain! let’s watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you! isn't that fun? :d<<storm?>><<storm?>><<storm?, are you listening to me?, storm are you still arguing with lina because of her aghanim? she made a mistake, everybody makes mistakes, there is no need to take it personally! now she knows that aghanim is a no-no, she’s got it, now just chill out man, it’s a game!>> :d*slap*<< :o b-but storm, w-why?

(this is pointless, updating takes - seconds) uplaod your game data to the devs for some reason. share the game data to other computers to automatically update the game.now i have a lot of questions for this, now let me get to the what i suppose to be the frequently asked questions.. what do you mean share my game data to the devs?- it takes your game data and transfers it to other computers for auto update.. what's so bad about this?- this software without any permission uses your bandwith, which is just pure malware.. why doesn't my antivirus say anything about it?- because i don't really know, stop using norton.all in all i would rate this game as nice in /, but putting this into their game just turned into a spyware game, you get fun but you lose all your credit card information. not really if you have any questions, go to the review discussion ⠀⠀⠀-rust",0

17472,"an older game, to be sure, but has its own charm and holds a special place in my heart - having played it since i was young. definitely still has some grind if you want to run through *all* of the content, but if someone just wanted to get right into the action, i'm fairly certain he or she could get up to speed quickly. pretty expansive variety of races and classes, with few restrictions if any (evil races can play as good classes by betraying and vice versa).i would still recommend buying a subscription if you want to play endgame content (removes most limitations), and unfortunately there are a couple extra features that need to be bought outside of that, but if you buy the sub, you can collect the credits to get those free of charge anyhow. not sure how playing free through the whole game would be, but i'm sure it's both viable and still fun.the lore in this game is incredible if you're into deep storylines. i wouldn't say the questing feels as epic as it did in the original everquest, but some of the story arcs can make you feel like your character is the hero he or she is espoused to be. plus, the game still receives consistent updates and i've even seen guide-run events (by volunteers or employees in game) more recently.playerbase can be a bit slim, but when a new server launches, usually there's a ton of people who come out.if you're into mmo's, don't mind a bit of grind and graphics that aren't cutting edge, i'd recommend trying this game!",1

issues or the downtime that was a result of our effort to get the marketplace back where it was before this occurred. all marketplace transactions should have been reversed and the items sold should be back in your inventory for you. as the flux that was received originally was not legitimate, we will be unable to provide the amount of flux to your account that the item sold for on the marketplace.in order to correct the economic issue, we removed items that were obtained after the duplication took place and before the servers were taken down. if you made a monetary, credit, or cubit purchase during this time-frame and had its contents removed that was not our intent. please update this ticket with information about what was purchased and when it occurred and we will look into refunding or restoring the purchase(s) back to your account.we do appreciate your patience in this matter and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that this issue has caused. if you would

infront of you times when things weren't money hungry and cancerous, the game has been getting worse and worse each update they introduce due to making more items untradable under your nose too adding new game breaking or nightmareish system updates they became so money hungry you cannot trade items u buy from the store with irl money anymore nor can u resell credit pouches (pouches u buy sell to players for flux) so once u buy it for yourself a merch or by mistake it automatically consume this item and you will be forced to buy an untradable item u may not want or cannot sell take example back in the day you could buy something in the store by accident with irl or credits and then realize u misclicked (happens wen your awake late at night half asleep) and you where like meh i can just resell it for my money back no harm done, no but now if you do this your % screwed you will be stuck with it and another thing is there events wen they make there events they have game breaking drop rates or side effects that can effect the entire game, wealth, player base for months since early its been going down hill it really got hit hard end of most items are untradable at this point instead of making more things tradable so new players can actaully make money, im one of the very few very rich players with over million flux i have met over players less then k flux and under k flux they

9927,"well, this game is awesome, it is very fun, it has a good variety of classes, you can job change, it has a lot of weapons and armor sets, it has some nice looking costumes, you have special moves (actives, special actives, and a hyper active for second job change), you can level up your character to get more passives, actives etc, it has a good selection of dungeons each village, the dungeons have monsters minibosses and bosses, the minibosses and bosses have unique drops, there are a lot of npcs and quests that they can give you, there are about villages, you can buy craft and sell things, honestly, this game is the best i've seen in years, and there's one thing i forgot to mention: this game has infinite loops! it helps a lot with pvp, so the only way they can get out of an infinite loop is to mana break (hold down x or z until it comes to mana), and, well, all in all, this game is awesome! /! an absolute must play!",1

16669,"not gonna lie i love this game but the recent update is compleatly crap. how are you gonna compleatly kill a tower (balloon chipper) and call it balancing? ouh yea because you literally took advice from a youtuber and compleatly went with what he said. and the thing is he isnt even a good player. you guys compleatly ditched what everyone was telling you guys to do and went with a youtubers advice. and another thing although i dont personally like late game the balloon chipper was the only way to get crazy late game. and another thing i wanna say is blaze it comleatly gave you guys all the files to his modded server (all the towers were viable and were all balanced) and you guys didnt even care about it and went with with super jom bombo. i understand you made this change to make people use other towers, but you cant compleatly destroy a tower combo that was the only way to defend round rushes and more. another thing is this game is compleatly pay to win. theres literally a way to pay to be on leaderboard (it would take a lot of money but its possible). another thing is you guys were trying to make other towers viable but i will tell you guys exactly how to do that, just buff other towers. simple. you dont have to make any towers worse than they already are, just buff other towers. and onother thing is you guys literally made typeos in youre coding. thats all im gonna say although i could say soo much more. fix youre game ninja kiwi!",0

16238,"so let me break it down. world of guns: gun disassembly is a unique 'game' if i've ever seen one.you start off with a classic kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt, not much of a spoiler there. but yeah.the game is all about unlocking things; field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly, dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly... assemble to operation, operation to game, game to super game and super game to hardcore game. you can geuss what the first three are; operation is using the various features on a gun, changing handgrips, firing it, attaching a silencer or even folding a stock. the games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together, you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint. on super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.you might be thinking okay thats easy well... i've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. a few times the game screws you over by saying you need to do this first even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.example: you need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. one gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. but this particular gun needs both to be on.its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.on the graphics end of it. the outside of the gun, looks awesome. / texturing. on the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. this means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. no complaint unless your obbscessed with hd textures.on the of the guns themselfves. tons of variety. i find quite a few guns i like in their collection, however... i need to sift through alot of guns i don't cary about at all just to get to them. sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? well, i'll tell you: total access. unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. so it makes playing fairly hard to do. also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, i do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. the graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to cs . esque graphics. aka crappy world textures and okay gun textures.there is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).first is coming back every day. don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. but make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. i managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. i have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of xp to use on unlocking guns. but, i can't use it because it's broken.last method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)quizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more xp you get to walk away with. get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for hours.the funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. it will however (even though i got all the questions right) lock me out for hours. its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet i get none of my earned points. it only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. craziest thing is... if i fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all. i feel like they're trying to keep me from getting points... cheeki bastards.anyways i'm reinstalling, still voting positive for this game. even though its got a bunch of cheeki breeki coders.",1

5088,"great game, but needs a ton more work done on it before it's a title worth spending any money on. (though the devs look like they will be delivering that ton more content it needs.) for those complaining about the online being hard it's because people playing this game on the pc are not used to brawlers or the strategy involved in them.(not many brawler type games for the pc, even fewer have online gameplay.) one good tip is when one guy has points and the rest of the team is averaging around then they need to work together to get the points balanced again. otherwise the guy with point just has to get hit once by the lowest scorer and accidentally fall off the map whenever his damage is high to keep anyone else from getting anywhere near him score wise. (easy win for anyone who actually read this.) there are many other tips and tricks assosiated with games exactly like this. but i'm too lazy to list em all. just use your heads people. (something that pc gamers have been doing allot less of since game capable computers have become easily affordable for the generall public. lets not end up like console online gaming.) i wrote this review in hopes that i can inspire better tactics in the player base... it's way to easy to win at the moment and it makes the game dull. review cap highest scorer= biggest threat. and feeding the weakest player when damage is high= easy wins.",1

10653,"after almost hours and achieving the rank of master two season's in a row, i feel like i can write a proper review for eternal. this game is great. it's almost disgustingly free to play. you'll be showered in packs and cards when you first begin, and getting a free card pack on your first ranked win a day has kept me returning time and time again. however, if you're looking for a cheap alternative to hearthstone, you're probably looking for shadowverse. eternal isn't an easy game by any means. the power system is very similar to magic the gathering, which can be very off-putting for anyone who hasn't played it before. i believe drawing mana makes the game more complex and allows for a wider array of decks than could ever be achieved in a system that gives you one mana every turn. if the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bothers you, this just isn't going to be the game for you. if you've been looking for a complex ccg with all the deep mechanics of magic the gathering while also being very generous in how easy it is to collect, i cannot recommend eternal enough.tl;dr: not great if you're just tired of hearthstone, but if you're willing to sit down and learn it's quirks, there is a truly complex and interesting card game that is very accomodating of small budget.",1

7317,"tldr my non recommendation has nothing to do with card acquisition or purchases. but purely mechanics. this is from both beta play and a little bit after launch as confirmation.i want to like tes: legends. i really do, not just because it is based in one of my favourite game worlds, but because it has some really cool mechanics. but some other core mechanics are absolute game breakers for me.the good:the elder scrolls, no seriously they've done great job of encapsulating the world and races into the cards. argonians have aggressive majika ramping, nords rapidly turn into a hoard, khajit get stronger by stealing from their opponent, dunmar always get the last laugh even in death. having played tes since arena i'm surprised how much this game captures the spirit of tamrial.lanes, they add an interesting strategic layer to the game. where you summon your creatures matter just as much as what you summon. do you throw a powerful creature into a crowded lane to thin the enemy ranks? or into a deserted lane where they have a clear shot at the enemy player?match effects, this type of game always gravitates towards fixed metas. having effects that throw a spanner in the works is a great idea. it keeps everyone on their toes.the bad:starting hand size, no i'm not kidding. maybe this isn't an issue for many, but for someone unlucky like me, this is a game breaker. i play mtg and even with seven cards i often struggle to get a balanced starting hand, but at only three staring cards i too often find myself waiting to turn - before i can do anything. meanwhile my opponent is already getting creatures on the field and dealing damage, often with snowball creatures. yes, yes, yes deck composition is important, but the simple fact remains that with cards ranging from majika to , + majika it's still too easy to get a starting set of - majika cards, discard your highs and still have - cost cards.it's really, really bad because it just so often leaves the games down to luck of initial draw. draw your really good low cost cards, you've got a strong chance, get deluged with high cost cards and you may as well give up before you even play a turn. so with this in mind, no, no i do not recommend the elder scrolls: legends... i want to, but with entire games hinging on a card draw, i can't.",0

12985,"i am not sure i would bother. it's an okay game if you just have it running in the background while you are doing something else, but later on in the game the tables just turn to the absurd. i have failed like / rushes in a row when they had a % or lower failure rate. this happened because radroaches spawned inside and started siphoning off all my energy, and mole rats for some reason at higher levels siphon energy extremely fast also. everything siphons energy when you get above people in your vault. the game just spikes in difficulty when you get to and to people so i think the smart way to play the game would be to just sit on your hands and try and pump up all your characters below people and then play the game afterwards. even so, the mechanics are stupid. if someone breaks into your vault and nobody is in a room (which happens it seems % of the time they go for an empty room) you have to send people from another area, then they inevitably get there too late and the invader burrows to another room, so eventually all your people are running everywhere and you can't keep track of which character has a good gun to actually fight off this invasion. all the while everyones taking radiation damage and physical damage, and they're siphoning off your energy--which in turn shuts down the majority of your vault buildings. its great. so then you have to temporarily pull people off of every other duty they were doing when your vault was humming like a swiss watch and put them onto energy production then you have to manage to remember to put everyone back where they were before hand--a near impossible task. its just an annoyance. a huge annoyance.then if you're lucky you spend the rest of the time just clicking on status updates, like gathering energy, or gathering food, or the rare opportunity that you are able to to level someones stats up. i think this game would be a lot better if the endurance stat did not exist. apparently the only way to really level up your heroes health a lot is to pump up their endurance. so you have to put all your low levels on endurance training for like real time days to pump up their endurance. only then can you really make use of them in other capacities if you really want to maximize their experience. it's pretty dumb. the whole game feels like a waste of time sadly. i just don't have much else to play so i am doing it. i swear though, the first time someone comes in and wipes my vault i am done with this game forever. its really a micro transaction game about gambling with the lunchboxes they give you early on. because lunchboxes (that you have to buy with real money to get in any regularity) contain cards which can help you when you are struggling. but they can also just give you useless legendary materials that % of people will never be able to use because they'll quit the game before they can make the stuff. its stupid. even then manufacturing a rare weapon took ~ real hours. i can only imagine a legendary one would take days or something,so in short. stay away. it just is not fun enough over the long term...the only real fun i have is going out on quests and even those require you to wait hours and hours unless you buy some nuka cola (yes, real money again) to speed things up. it's just a way to siphon money and its too nakedly obvious to want to even do it. generally games like this have you provide you with a fun experience along the way, but this one just feels % designed to siphon money.",0

4658,"does smite need any more word-of-mouth than it already has? probably not. but i'll throw in my two cents into the well anyway.before i even mention anything about the game itself i want to talk about the community that plays this game... word here is toxic. absolutely vitriol and toxic. so much anger and hatred is oozing from the vast majority of the player base polluting what could be an otherwise enjoyable experience. out of matches will devolve into a shouting match like the screenshot above. and this isn't even a smite problem to be honest, it's mainly a moba problem and the type of games that just attract this sort of crowd. be prepared to be yelled at, a lot. oh and yelling isn't even the worst of it. also be prepared to get reported. there's nothing more sore losers love than to press that report player button after almost every match. this game is not friendly to newcomers.with that out of the way i guess i should touch up on the game itself. it plays like any other moba out there; there's towers, minions, jungles, and an hq. but what makes smite stand apart from the crowd is it's unique perspective. instead of a typical top-down moba view smite will have you play via third person. so instead of having your camera roaming all over the place at all times you're invested in your character at all times. it's a nice breath of fresh air from the typical formula.now there is one final thing i wish to address before i call it a wrap here: loot crates. that god awful scourge that's rotting the gaming industry down to it's core. smite is waist deep in loot crates. granted it's not pay--win because everything is purely cosmetic. but with that said the prices are outrageous. the chests cost gems or $. and usually have total possible items in it. the catch? only to items in said chest are skins (that you probably actually want) the other + items are generally stupid emotes or other worthless trash you don't care for. so think about that for a moment, $ emotes, how do you feel about paying $ for an emote? someone who spent nearly or over $ on these damned treasure chests i regret every moment of it and wish i could take it all back. sure i got some of the skins i wanted but more often than not it was some lame avatar or emote i could care less about. and so i had to buy another loot crate until i got a slightly more favorable outcome. it's gambling, it's gambling at it's worst. and they make this problem a whole lot worse with exclusive and limited content. it's all about that buy buy buy mentality and falling for the hype and the marketing.if you're sitting here and debating if you should give smite a try i'll save you the trouble and suggest you look elsewhere to spend your time and money. but if you absolutely have to play this game be prepared for the toxic players and the irresistible allure of loot crates.",0

5678,"dcs has to be one of the best all round combat flight simulators. covering aircraft from ww all the way up to near current day airccaft. soon to have more aircraft and scenery modules added to the already growing number of study aircraft. this is far from an arcade simulation. it takes time and effort on users part to even gain a basic level of competence. if you have a good basic knowledge of flight and want to improve it further, this is as great of a starting point that there is on steam. skill in air combat is not needed to enjoy this simulation, there are many pilots that fly strictly formation /aerobatic / freeflight situations on multyplayer servers. i have great fun with friends and others i've met while flying this sim. online competion is out there on multyplayer if you want to be an ace. the options are in the sim to go that route, just be forewarned that there's no such thing as ace in a day with this simulator. i'm lucky to get kill per session, and there's been many a day that the totals were zero, but i still had a great time while engaged in dcs world. i suggest that you try this on steam as it is free to play with free aircraft included, once you've decided to purchace modules it may be best to purchace directly frrom eagle dynamics, as newer modules bought in steam won't transfer over to stand alone dcs world installed from eagle dynamics. new modules take longer to get from stand alone version into steam release. as well there's more sales on at eagle dynamics web store than steam has.there's a lot to thiis sim as far as content goes, and the future looks very bright for the next new modules that are coming down the pipe. any way you cut it this is a great simulator and a ton of fun. cya in the skies !!! ... chybear",1

1901,"i've been playing dota since december and i really like most of the aspects of this game. dota is great for players who aim for competetive gaming but is equally good for casual gamers who play for the sole purpose of enjoyment. one of the features of dota which i like the most is its ever-evolving meta gameplay which changes from time to time. just when u think you've figured out the meta, a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explore,learn and adapt to the changes. this changing metagame not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the professional scene. a champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams. the beauty of the game lies in its ever evolving nature. the more u learn about it, the more u fall in love with it. recommended for all gamers who have a thing for strategy games or want to try out dota beacuse of its huge community.",1

1629,"i can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is dota. but i will say the following generic things:dota is not a simple team game. there are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. you come into dota to have fun with tools, every character is a different tool. they move different, they turn different, they attack differently. if you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. if you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. like really into this.what makes dota different from other mobas? depth. dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. other mobas shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. you have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. in other games you will find these options baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character should be played. dota gives you the sandbox to experiment, as a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. this is a game. have fun.most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and valve facilitates this. but you don't have to. everything depends in dota. should you try dota? yes. but remember to have fun. you will be playing a game that can last hour per match. enjoy. smile. a lot of people forget this. if you're not enjoying dota. uninstall.",1

15056,"disclaimer- this preview was written during early access. robocraft is subject to change.-despite the disclaimer above, robocraft is already a pretty well oiled machine. most of the features are working quite efficiently and the core mechanics are in place. there are plenty of things to love about robocraft straight from go. the basic gist is you build a bot/death machine and battle it out against other peoples creations. where the beauty of the game lies is in its creativity, from a floating pirate ship to a mechwarrior style walker, you never know what you are going to end up fighting. robocraft is a multi-faceted game that has many layers of complexity, so i will do my best to break it all down but i may forget to mention something.the first time i loaded up robocraft i was greeted with an anti-cheat rd party software. not my favorite thing in the world but more than welcome for this type of game. aim-bots have ruined other games and i appreciate the extra safeguard. that being said, the game does actually take quite a while to load up all of its assets. also the game crashed right after the long load up. not a great first impression. i credit this to early access hiccups and reloaded the game with little to no problems.upon second load up, i was brought into the heart of the game, the lobby. i watched as my pre-made bot gently floated in circles and i waited. nothing happened. what was i waiting for you ask? a tutorial or anything for that matter. nothing came. so i began randomly clicking around. i felt dizzy and lost with the amount of buttons, however this isn't my first rodeo and especially not my first battle arena style game.after clicking around, my curiosity led me to the build mode. after a minor pop-up that explained a few buttons. i wouldn't call this a tutorial more a crash course but i digress. the builder is exceptional! it reminds me of space engineers where you build things in first person view and can quickly change the direction of parts with a roll of the mouse wheel. you are given some basic parts but most unlock through the games leveling system and huge branching parts tree.the way things work is that you unlock parts the more you level. you level by playing in matches and destroying other vehicles. after leveling you unlock that part for purchase. you don't get that part for free, just the ability to buy it. there are some ways around this but we will get to that later. the builder is quite extensive needless to say and a quick google search of peoples creations is somewhat awe inspiring and impressive. sadly my skills and blocks were inferior and building my own machine was not necessarily the best idea, not yet at least. the only problem i found was that i was very limited for the most part at the beginning of the game. the basic starting vehicles and parts work but they don't really make you feel like a bador all that cool. especially as you will more then likely see other people using the same vehicle with slight variations. things don't really become all that unique and interesting until much farther into the tech tree and amassing a fortune of in-game currency.after this, i jumped into one of the pre-made vehicles and got into battle mode. i was not disappointed at all. there are several modes and they add different objectives and themes. you have team deathmatch, a conquest type mode, and boss battle, my personal favorite. in boss battle, you and many smaller craft face off against much bigger and advanced craft. this requires a great deal of team work and coordination on both teams part otherwise you end up dead very quickly. the same can be said for conquest mode, which features capture nodes that must be protected/assaulted to attain victory. in all, my experience with the battle modes was fast, visceral, and fun. usually whoever shoots first wins but sometimes i managed to win, even if i was left heavily wounded. the only problem i found with combat was queuing up, which could take anywhere from to minutes per match. which given that some matches last about the same length, was a bit much for my taste. graphically, everything was very nice with robocraft as well. while the focus isn't on the environments, the terrain had some nice detail and good level design, offering multiple options for different kind of play styles. the focus is for sure on the vehicles and this shows quite nicely. from the crackle of energy as your plasma cannons fire, to glowing energy panels. the only thing i felt needed a bit of work was the way you exploded which felt more like a firecracker going off than an actual explosion.the soundtrack was there. but i found it forgettable for the most part. however, i did love the sound effects. robocraft is one of those games where you want to load up your own tunes and go to work. the options menu was rather robust with a decent amount of graphical options and rebindable keys. so let's talk about the elephant in the room, the microtransactions. now robocraft is not pw or pay to win, but more like pay to skip. if you are a premium user everything is a bit easier as you earn more rp(in-game currency) and double the experience. aside from all that, you can also purchase gc which is a premium currency that you can use to purchase most things from parts to premium status. mind you, level still applies to this, if you aren't the right level, you can't use something ahead of everybody else in combat. where the lynch pin lies is in the robo shop, which allows players to purchase premade bots for real cash. this auto levels them to that particulars bots level and tier, essentially skipping the grind and getting into the good stuff. while this is far from a pw scheme, the problem i see is that this makes the free to play aspect kinda lame. grinding and getting up to that point is going to take you months of work where as some dude with twenty bucks did it in five seconds. your time isn't valued here, your wallet is more important. you may be vastly more experienced in the game but getting anything done is going to be a nightmare due to queues and the way the experience system works. you are given experience based off your contribution, meaning if you have a couple of bad matches, expect zero experience. now one could argue that this is fair. the developer has to make money some how and development isn't cheap, also the player should be rewarded for coughing up some dough. the problem is that the free to play experience isn't as exciting.it's like going to the zoo and seeing only the animals feet because you didn't pay. on the other side of the pay wall they have a freaking petting zoo, and you get to ride a cheetah. which is a damn shame because in robocraft you probably can make an actual cheetah, just expect to do it in weeks-months of grinding or drop a few bucks and get that shiny cheetah right away. everything just feels heavily stacked towards premium accounts. this shows in every aspect of the game.if you take anything from this review remember this, robocraft is a game that requires large amounts of time investment or some cash to get to the really cool stuff. the game runs well and the combat is fun but long queues and long load ups can drag the overall experience down. you can take everything i say with a grain of salt though, because the game is free to play. you have nothing to lose but time. so feel free to check the game out and make up your own opinion. robocraft is fun and worth it alone for the boss battles and seeing the huge bots. i haven't seen many games like robocraft, especially ones that let you have this much freedom to make whatever you want.",1

8657,"quality fun br game that is in early development. the word alpha is attached, but it is pretty clearly beyond what one might think of as an alpha game. the game received a lot of flak from people including myself over a recent patch that was quickly changed back to something closer to how they had it before. the game has only been available for a couple weeks and has already seen numerous balance changes. some for the better, some not, but it is clear they want to get it right. who knows where this game will go but i can't deny that it is fun testing it.edit: spelling",1

8222,"sorry for my bad grammer i rushed through thisthis game is one of the best mmo's i have seen. honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.my pros to the game..character creation. it was easy to understand, and i didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice.graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg..leveling is fast and fun..objectives of quest are most of the time clear..although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this..pvp, this has its flaws and perfections.the story is over all good.levels are nicely done.many people have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion upgrades... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to - a day just by doing pvp... or even more if u do dungeons and other stuff...you can also get them from profesions like leadership... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral...cons to this game.. skill tree: some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right..i go through levels and my armor looks like the samei had on at the boat crash like wat.pvp. has some balancing to do.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again..the heck is up with the dlc's jesusagain sorry didnt check for grammer just typed so yea...over all this is a great game.",1

1020,"lots of strategy and tactics and a lot more as this game develops. i play a ton of wot and this is more involved in your strategy and tactics options. i would recommend the short tutorial, then go to the firing range for a few minutes, then do the tutorial again, and then jump into the game. there is a match making rating system to try to keep balance and have new players with new players. you can fly with friends, you can have your own test matches against friends. currently there are issues with matchmaking struggling to put together games, so the two minute wait can sometimes be more like minutes. the game is much more about playing than grinding. i put my money on it to support it, and thus far it is not pay to win. games can last minutes and the action ratchets up as you get bonuses built up. the win or loss as the players get more experienced can almost be a surprise - you thought you had more time, or you didn\'t evade and get to where you were needed. watch the videos on the starter ships also. definitely worth a try, and coming back to again and again as they finish polishing it. remember it is in the final stages of alpha, but it is completely playable, and just darn good.",1

6284,"if you are looking for a free to play world war game this not for you. it is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. i am an ironsight player from other ww games all the way up to modern fps games and the sights for this game are just horrendous. map layout- the layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.weapons- starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. if you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). if you use a gun or grenade too much you have to repair it. yes you have to repair a grenade!!! the expense of repairing a weapon or grenade is about the same price as a new gun. so if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game. free to play- yes you can download it and play a few games for free. but if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. or you can shell out money to play. i have played world of tanks, war thunder, and other ww ftp games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game. this is no where near a free to play game. yes this is a beta so maybe it will change but right now it is very much a free but you have to pay to continue farther game.",0

2034,"i'll make my review short and sweet. this game belongs to my favorite genre... fantasy iso arpg. i've played nearly all of them over the years. others may bring nostalgia and pleasant memories, but path of exile is just a love letter from the developer's to that specific genre. personally, i think it's the best game in the genre, and it's constantly being updated and improved. the story is great as you discover the tragic history of wraeclast, through encountering relics during your playthrough. the storytelling is uniqe, and it is mostly done through voiceovers so there is very little interference in actual gameplay. the skill tree is massive and may be intimidating at first, so try going into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and saving it to your favorites, then referring to it when you level up. you gain skills through gems, as well as ways to improve those skills by linking your gems together on your armor and weapons. the controls are responsive and intuitive and your skills/abilities make you feel powerful. poe is free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic items and loot boxes. i got me some glowy eyes.",1

11225,"eternal card game review - raymond ktsummary: six-guns and sorcery collide in eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun. eternal brings aaa pace and polish to the the infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game. the only limits are your own creativitywith spells and swords, six-guns and subterfuge, heroes collide in the struggle for the eternal throne. where will you stand? join the battle in eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun.variance. a lot of people will say variance is in all card games, it's part of the game, and i will agree with them. however, when playing eternal in any of its formats, there are far too many non-games - games where you have drawn too many sigils (lands), or too few, or are missing a colour entirely; games where you have drawn poorly and/or the opponent has drawn perfectly; games that are not really games, because either you, or your opponent, did not really participate.eternal is very much a 'value' game rather than a 'combo' game, -for-'ing your opponent is always what you play to, and often what you lose to. while out-valuing your opponent can be fun, often a single 'out-value' moment can snowball into victory. why? deck size requirements are too high ( for sealed, for draft), you can only mulligan once, and games are a 'best of ', which means that consistency is regularly quite low. with this, even the best decks can easily lose repeatedly to lower tier decks, even if the match-up is favourable.also, this issue of variance practically doubles in draft. the limited format is decent, and the card design makes it clear that mtg professionals have assisted with creating the set. however, the drafting stage takes place with ai bots (draft with bots, play against live players), and the ai often make strange choices that lead into odd drafting signals. packs also have extremely poor variance, often only containing one card of a particular colour. due to this, it's quite often that you will be passed a pack where there are literally no good picks for your colour(s) (even at pick ), and even pack--pick- can be extremely poor. these issues exacerbate the previously mentioned variance issues, often leading to a bad draft experience.",0

13337,"i've played hours so far, so i think i can make a review about it. the game is very similar with minecraft, so most of the stuff from there would be here aswel.here are some pros and cons.pros:-the game is free to play.-it's so simple to make the server and to have others join. you can make it private (just for you and friends) or you can make it public and have a lot of ppl join in.-the game have nice features to protect yourself from trolls and noobs. -good graphics! -you can rotate every block in the game (even furniture), so you can build cool structures and have good decorations.-the game is harder than minecraft, it has a nicer combat imo.-it takes much longer to build and craft stuff wich i find it more compeling-you have a sense of progression. you unlock recipes by descovering blocks and crafting stuff.-the game lets you build your own adventure and share it with the community. (not something that i find fascinating, but its a nice feature)-you can customize your character.cons:-the game has some bugs. the ladder is so annoying, you won't fit on it properly, you have to struggle, it feels like the character is to big to fit into a block gap with the ladder. sometimes when you close doors or traps, you get pushed into the air and fall to death. you can farm some resources with ease (diamonds and coals), by using glitches. sometimes when you use a potion or food to regen, it won't activate. (those bugs are rare, not something that will annoy you, beside the ladder, that is so annoying, but they need to be fixed).-the game doesn't have weather (rain, snow, thunderstorms... ect.), instead it has a temperture that it shows up whenever you are in a specific zone (savannah is really hot and you can burn to death or in the mountains you can freeze to death if you don't have a fire nearby). the temperature is a really nice feature, but combined with weather or seasons, that would have been so much better and insane!!! -the tree leaves won't decay. they just stay in the air after you take a tree down.-fps problems in the multiplayer. rare small rollbacks (not something that will be a problem). need to be better optimised. not a big problem, not something that will occur everytime.-the game need to have more monster models, more adventures. portals to other worlds. bosses need to be added. more content would really make the game better.-the game does not have a hunger feature in it. you can't starve. you can craft food however and use it to regen your health.-wanted to see some zombies in it. wanted to see some random villages with npcs that can sell stuff like it minecraft. adding humanoids would have been nice.-wanted to see more blocks and decorations.my conclusion:the game is really nice to play with friends and to have that minecraft vibe in a fp game. the game have nice graphics and new mechanics and ideas that you can't see in minecraft, but it also lacks several cool features from minecraft. the game could really become incredible if more content were to be added into the game. beside the issues that it has and the lack of some features, it's stil a very good game, one that i enjoyed so far and will play it more. i recommend it! i also hope the game will be active and the devs will improve it over the next months and years.",1

2325,if you want to play a game that's crafted with thought and care i would highly recommend this one. ggg shows they really care about their players and the effort they put in to assembling new mechanics every season is very commendable.it's system allows you to customize and tailor a character to your liking and their is a lot of flexibility to adapt to your own playstyle. if the skill tree is too complex to start there are tons of forums and guides to run you through builds until you're comfortable creating one on your own.give it a try,1

3029,"/ - yeah's pretty good.i guess i should probably say something about this game since my play time.i'll try keep it short but here goes.positives:-lots to do, lots to achieve. over vehicles. if you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as warframe or runescape (not as crazy as runescape though) this is a great time sink. it's kept my interest for a while now.-best pre-ww to cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soon) out there. it has its faults but compared to other free to games out there i honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. it becomes fulfilling -good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. runs well on most systems too.-free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. the options for free to play are quite forgiving.cons:-is. (hate that thing) in all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. it's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. updates are frequent and the pr has gotten much better, gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-you must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with american mid-tier planes (my god.) be prepared for people you can't rely on.tips:-you must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-don't claim russian bias when you die to a russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. i guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-is-'s, t's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -the youtube community is great for tips, i recommend slickbee, theorangedoom, napalmratte, phlydaily, squire, mcchickenbites to name a few.it's hard to condense what i think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then i do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. if you've played world of tanks or other free to plays that are around ww era this will stand out for you.thanks for reading this far. feel free to murder me in the comments.",1

3777,"the simplicity of the game is what makes the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and i cannot tell you how much fun it is to learn how to play each class. when i first branced out into other classes for real was when mvm came out and i was practically forced to play other roles to support the team and at that point it's when i realized i had love for more than just the sniper and spy and i could learn to enjoy all the other classes too. there's always something of each class everybody can enjoy. (maybe not everybody)but why do i hate this game even though i gave it a good rating? the fact that this game is slowly dying and to me it seems like valve seems to care less and less about tf and just scrap up community maps for new updates and shove in skins and try to squeeze as much money as they can. the last update wasn't terrible it had me playing for a couple more hours but it wasn't enough to bring me back to the good old days. not only that but the prices of trading only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which makes trading dead unless you have unsuals on you.but why bother leaving a good review you might ask? because the only thing that tf seems to do right compared to every other game out there in the market, is that no matter how much i hate this game, get bored of it and realize how it's dying. every month or so i will eventually come back to it anyway. the game is amazing and i can't deny it even if i wanted to. tl;dr - i ing hate this game but you should definetly still play it because i love it./ would definetly get stabbed by a spy again",1

12369,"pros: - decent character customization- i really liked the fact you can tame pretty much anythingcons: where do i begin..- graphics are not up to par with what i expected. yes, it's an older engine but the world just looked so bland and boring- unoptimized. fps was way below what it should be for the computer i had- as a founder, my rewards were locked to the first character i created. also, you can only create characters per server. on top of that, i was forced into a faction- content that was promised was not released (ie. end game). i was also getting drops for classes that they had said they would release at a later date- everything felt too easy. you could solo the first two dungeons. you could autopath to every quest npc/area. while this might be fine for a game like bdo where there is no flight path to anything, this game has multiple fast travel methods- poor translation of skills, notifications you are now level, attack for and make gain rage- i felt that given this game has been out years, the level of polish in this game was not up to par. it just felt clunky and unrefined. and i did try multipe classes and found it the same.tldr: i had low expecations and it still didn't meet those expecations. i paid for the deluxe edition ($ cdn) and thankfully i was able to get a refund. i will maybe give this a try later on when they, i dunno, actually finish creating the game.",0

10996,"so i'm actually enjoying this game, or rather i should say i really want to. doesn't seem pay to win (keep in mind i only have hours played.) i finished the campaign (sometimes losing pointlessly because i couldn't draw sigils) and did my first gauntlet run, i was excited to see what this gamemode would be, the idea of playing to win better rewards to meet an ultimate boss and get the final tier prize was enticing, anyway, i lost my first match instantly and that ended my run because i drew no sigils.. ok so by now i've unlocked ranked play, being a veteran hearthstone player i choose to create a mid/lategame red/green focused deck and jump into ranked, lose my first two matches because i only draw - sigils. (great) i'moff, but after i believe my first match i get a premade deck (provided to me by the game) for playing a ranked match. great. seems like a good and balanced deck, earlygame focused but with control aspects and cards that provide you with sigils. awesome. maybe this will solve my problem of sigils lacking eh? (by this moment i'm severelyoff at rng) i go on to play matches with this deck and lose both times because i can't for the love of , ing draw sigils.(anyway :]) i go on to play my last placement match for ranked with the premade justice deck which i have had luck in the campaign with, (i also enjoyed the aggressive creature focus playstyle of it) needless to say, the earlygame went great i drew sigils of justice and played them, this got me a huge lead in the earlygame. i continue to press my opponent, he is at around health (however through the entire game i have not drawn a single sigil.. and drew cards which cost - 'power'{this game's mana currency}) at this moment my enemy has sigils/power and whilst i am overdrawing on cards because i can play nothing, he is reactively playing and actually engaging with the game. he drops a legendary and basically pounds me into oblivion from hp because i legitimately can't play the game.i have never experienced more consistent bad rng in the game, the game needs a serious bad luck protection system, or provide a better more concrete way of drawing & playing sigils (just realised i haven't explained what those are, they are a prerequisite for playing 'alligned' cards in this game, like magic's 'lands') it's a disgusting feeling having to concede games in campaign because you realise in the rd-th turn you are going to lose. and then go on to ranked multiplayer and realise you can't concede or you lose rank, play and getoff because you redrew your starting hand into the minimum amount of sigils times in a row, and you draw no more and you can do nothing for the entire game.obviously my opponents did not experience the same bad luck, so this might just be me, or the strongest decks are those build around sigil requirements & card draw/ power cost cards :).but this might just be me being extremely unlucky, so take my review with a healthy proportion of salt (if you think i haven't provided enough)",0

10904,"so far, the game mechanics are very similar to, yet distinct from, a mix of mtg and hearthstone. i will say that the game flows much better and faster than either of those two, and the rules are not as ambiguous nor as tedious to memorize as either of the other two.as for eternal, itself, being able to mix and match elements coherently is nice, while not being constrained on character choice based on how my deck plays was cool, as well. i've only so far completed the first chapter of the campaign and some of the battles in the second chapter, and i'm really excited to say that it feels like the kind of card game i could sink hours into and get a lot done in at the same time.i'd like to see what direwolf does in the future and more of the game before i offer any criticisms or suggestions, and thus far, i have not encountered any bugs in the game, myself.",1
11212,"whelp, what started as a hopeful replacement for the terrible current meta in hearthstone, i have put enough hours into this game's ranked play to conclude it's even more poorly balanced than yugioh, and even very low ranks are infiltrated with decks and players far in excess of what their rank belies. i'm strongly familiar with mtg as i have decades of experience playing it and am no slouch with strategy, timing, counterplay, bluffing, etc. while i credit this game for having the kind of depth that hearthstone lacks, it is a shame that the game is otherwise wrecked by awful balancing and match making. there are some absurdly powerful decks and combinations, and wouldn't you know it, / players you meet are playing cookie cutter top meta builds. this is identical in nature to hearthstone where players with +% win rate decks intentionally concede their way to lower ranks for the purposes of easier grinding of in game currency and quest completions off potentially lesser skilled players yet should they be interested in players of comporable decks and skill they need not procede up the ranks, as everyone is right there with them at the bottom. this game continues to suffer from the usual issues you can expect from a mtg knock-off (mana-flood/drought) happening way more often than one would think possible, and utterly avoidable considering the digital formating, the games quickly devolve into whom can be first to inact their imbalanced strategy or who is last to fail to achieve the power resources they need. this game's design philosophy seems mired in a swamp of developer ideas of what would happen if we made late game strategies possible by turn ?' genius. also, paywin in the extreme. not recommended for casuals and non-whales.",0

13160,"fallout shelter has arrived for pc, as a mobile port. itâ€s still a bethesda game and itâ€s still fallout, but can a mobile fallout game work on steam??first of all the game is free to play, so yes you guessed it, it has micro-transactions in it, but i will write about that a little later.the grafix in the game is very true to fallout and that pleased me when i saw that, itâ€s very well made and you actually get the feeling that you are playing a fallout game.now the game starts of as you been a manager of a fallout shelter and you give it a name. then you are taken through a tutorial of some of the basics and then you are set and go for the rest. the problem is though you still donâ€t know half of what you can do in the game, or what the game later will introduce you to. there is a help section, and i can only recommend you reading it, because it gives you valuable information on how to management your dwellers into the right places, so you get faster resources. and this is where the problems really start in my opinion, and where it shows that it is a mobile port. the waiting time you have to wait for resources are pretty long when you really canâ€t do much else. - minutes to be allowed to press a button to get resources is a long time. the first mins you are pretty occupied with the game because everything is new, but then it starts getting boring. there are small events that happens like animal infestations or attack on your vault but thatâ€s pretty much it. i am missing a more eventful game, maybe earthquakes or something else than a fire that can happen because you tried to be greedy with rushing resources. the game has different items, armor, guns and pets in it, that makes it more interesting, and it is cool having your dwellers running around looking different. a way to increase your population is to make love and produce babyâ€s and that is a funny feature, again though it takes sooo long time to actually produce a new dweller and have it grow up to be able to work in your rooms. now if you get passed the waiting time, and play it as a normal pc game, you will eventually get enough dwellers to unlock the observere room, where the more interesting part of the game opens up. being able to send your dwellers on quests is a nice feature, but yet again the time it takes to do something is brutally long. ranging from min to - houres for your dwellers to get to a location is something you just wont sit and wait for. this is yet again a place where the mobile part of the game shows, because you are more inclined to close down and look at it again later when you are on your mobile phone, than on a pc. you donâ€t want to open up a game, to play for minutes to close it down again waiting for new things to do. when you actually get to play a quest, you get a new mini game where you have to kill something or answer questions about fallout. i like this part in the game, i just donâ€t like having to wait hour plus to be able to do it.off course if you use nuca cola which is the real money currency in the game, you can get there instant, and now my rant starts. the starter pack is . euro, which is fine, you seem to be getting a decent amount of things, but then the price goes up. - euros for nuca-cola when it cost maybe to go instant is way overpriced. i am inclined to say that if you do not pay money for the game, you canâ€t play it as a pc game, and has to play it as a mobile wait game, and that is where i get annoyed. if you port something to a specific console, you should really make sure that the game is still fun for none paying players, or ask a decent price for it and lower the time for things to finish. even minimising the game to try will eventually pause the game (having it to reload when you return), and if you havenâ€t bought the starter pack you donâ€t have the handy auto loot machine running around picking up loot for you. yet again you are losing out when you donâ€t pay. the sound in the game is standard for a mobile game, itâ€s not great but itâ€s all right, it works for fallout shelter. should you play it? well that depends, if you want a game where you are occupied all the time, and having to wait for things to finish is a bother for you, without paying for it, then this game might not be for you. if however you donâ€t mind having a game you open up from time to time, and play for minutes maybe if you do a quest, then this can could be just what you needed in your life. :)",0

10895,"currently the best ccg i've found. gets round some of the things that can make a game of mtg unfun, with less mana screw or floods, without removing the tactical mana thinking. less randomness & more proper thinking than hearthstone (although there are a few cards that are a bit random). far less bland than the elder scrolls card game - indeed, the world building is pretty fun.give it a go. it's generous with free cards, and the legendaries are mostly not super overpowered (except maybe sandstorm titan...). plus, if this means anything to you, it's developed by lsv, a titan himself. just a fun, well developed game.",1
4808,"fun to play for a while, really enjoyed it. played a lot of ai to practice and played mostly arena. there are certainly issues with the game, for instance how long it takes to unlock the gods without buying the $ god pack. but the one really terrible aspect was the matchmaking. i had very few close matches. and if i won a match, the next time i played, no one seemed to have a clue. it was as if the game saw you win a couple and stacked a team against you to make you lose. it got to the point where i really have trouble wanting to log in to a match. it was very similar to paladins. too many one sided matches. too many times the teams should have been mixed up. you can tell when one team has borders, high fantasy points, higher god levels against a team full of level gods with the basic default everything. feels pointless and demoralizing. maybe hi rez doesn't care about anything but e-sports, or they don't know how to match people of similar skill. don't know but i stopped playing paladins because of it and i am most likely going to stop playing smite. there are better games that have developement teams dedicated to gameplay rather than just e-sports and cash shops. (dont mind the cash shops and the cool skins, but when you play matches in a day and get stomped each time, you can't get enough points to get the cool stuff.) most losses came from playing with people who had no clue how the game worked, didnt buy items, ran in and died everytime, or could not follow up anything. sooo, i would recommend trying the game out, but don't spend any money unless its a game you really really feel your gonna be dedicated even when matchmaking sucks the soul out of you. as for me, i've had much more frequent fun, close games with overwatch, dota and lol.",1

10995,"i paid about usd and climbed to gold rank in two weeks, with the win rate of % or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.pros:it is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. the cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving + + to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.cons:the playing itself is very dull and rng heavy and frustrating.if you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.if both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. if the opponent plays tavrod for turns and you only have removal, you lose.if the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn , you lose.if the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.if your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a steward of the past, which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.at the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. in hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm.matches are very snow-bally, one sided and rng. i feel whatever i do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome. you can try and play for free.but be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.i will come back only if they change the power system.",0

7553,"trove is a classic grinding mmo, with an option to fast-forward the grinding with real money. the game is fun, the different classes lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game. the enemies balance well with the player level, and the game is paced so as to offer the player a reward at intervals that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure. one of the greatest features is the cornerstone- your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome. the downside is that grinding mmo's require functional servers to enjoy, and the developers can't seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life. in the past two weeks since i began playing, with . hrs on record, there was not a day that passed without the servers going down. disruptions of less than an hour or do not make the forum ( i think the dev's see them as common) but looking at the forum you can see that the server goes down for long periods at approximately day intervals.

9708,"to be honest, no one should have the right to write a review other than me. as you can see, i have over thousands of hours into this game. who can make a better review than i am, right? anyways, let’s get started with this type of pay to win type of genre game. elsword is a pay to win game period. no matter what other people will tell you otherwise if you don’t pay a bit of cash, you would almost guarantee of no progress into the game. you think i’m joking right? wrong!!! if you don’t believe me, try for yourself! don’t say i didn’t tell you. just remember that no kids should use their parents’ credit card. let’s move on…there are items in the item mall which are a must for your gaming experience. it would cost around $ bucks or some for beginners. why $? well, items like more skills usage, etc. i am not going to list them all since it will beat the purpose of this review. $ is just the beginning, and then you probably need better equipments and other things to make your character a bit stronger, which could approximately cost around $ – infinite amount money because it depends on luck. yes, this game is totally casino base type of things. so, expect to get a lot of frustration when playing this game. i will not go into details as why because again it will beat the purpose of this review. most of my friends are all already quit because of that if not sold their accounts. there are other things as well which i don’t know if i should say it; whatever, i’m still going to say it…. it is their customer service. when you have a problem with your related game support, the gm or customer support simply copy and paste their usual statement as a way to answer the question. you hear me right, it is a copy and paste statement that no matter what types of questions you ask them the answer is always the same unify one. it sounds weird but that’s how they do their responses. all in all, i’m still playing this game not because it is fun but because i spent crazy amount of money and i don’t really want to waste what i’ve given down. the only celebration that i will do for this game is when is you know what happens. or, if i get all my money back which i doubt they will do.my last question to wrap up my review is if you make this game your life, oh boy i can’t imagine what would’ve happened if this game you know what happens. will you buy the rope from wal-mart and commit you know what attempts? well, only time will tell.",0
983,"hello friends! this game is one of my favorites. i've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. so if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. this game is also % free to play! with absolutely no pay to win involved. crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) you can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. some of which are really cool and lovingly made. and no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. the models and graphics in this game are georgous. it plays smoothly and is well optimized. it is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. but honestly it is amazingly polished. and at the time i am writing this things are in a great place. the balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. the thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though i love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team. i hope you pick this title up and love it the way i do. see you out there.",1
9107,"let me be clear: this game takes some serious getting used to. you will be lost for the first several hours, and even after that, figuring out how you fit into your team's overall objective is going to be difficult. i had the major benefit of joining a platoon (a group of squads and squad leaders working together under the command of a platoon leader) early on, and doing so went a long way towards helping me understand how to play the game well. as an indavidual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team. this means picking a class and sticking to it for the most part. for those of you who think immediately: i want to snipe! some words of caution: you will be killed, counter-sniped, and pushed around a lot. in the begining, your kill count will be low, and firefights will be overwhelming. the scope of this game is massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console *cough* cod *cough*, just because you have a sniper rifle doesn't mean you're going to be a headhunting god out the gate: battlefield-esqe bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capabilities will see to that. you will likely be outperformed by hard-scopers if you try to play the quickscope game here, long weapon rechamber and reload times will ensure that. why? because this game does not feel that every soldier on the battlefield is equal, headshots cannot kill every target in one hit, especially depending on the rifle you use, with a fair few requiring two or more hits to kill regardless of where you hit your target. at a range beyond meters, only the highest powered weapons will drop targets in one shot. only one faction specific weapon has the damage output to headshot most targets in one hit at any range: downside? it has a trigger delay and that will throw your shots way off target. starting to sound unfair? welcome to planetside, where every faction has very distinct pros and cons to its equipment sets and abilities. for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight: prepare to be outflanked, double teamed, and owned by vehicles en masse. your k/d is going to hurt in the begining. no two automatic weapons are equal in any way, find one that works well for you, and stick to it. with all of this said, this game is not newbie friendly: veteran players will have a more diverse set of weapons, better implants, and know many of the nooks and crannies you might try to hide in, advantage being, the layout of each continent has changed a few times over the years, so there are plenty of spots yet to be used frequently. this game is somewhat pw, allowing you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster, however with the exception of a few differently colored weapon iterations, whose stats are exactly the same as the base model, nothing in this game is unobtainable by simply playing the game, but it is a grind, as is every mmo ever made. still sound like your kind of challenge? welcome to the battle for auraxis! pick your side, pick your guns, and strap yourself in, you aren't in kansas anymore!",1

5611,"while i have only played minutes on the steam version, i have already clocked in a good hours on the original world of tanks on pc and another or so on the mobile version of world of tanks blitz and another on the newly released world of tanks blitz on the windows store. the game is great, it's basically a downscaled and simplified version of the original world of tanks, it has less tanks than the original, and less maps. it still has micro-transactions in it that is available in most free-to-play games. however, micro-transactions only allow you to progress faster in the tech tree, the further you are on it, the tougher your enemies. the micro-transactions are not pay-to-winthe gameplay isn't very different from the original world of tanks, only that it's faster, the maps are smaller, and matches generally last less than minutes. a new armor highlighter system has been added for this version of the game, letting players see which parts of the armor are easier to penetrate. this however, may turn off some of the more hardcore players, you must understand however, that world of tanks blitz is designed as a casual game, not a heavily competitive one.progression is somewhat of a grind, where you have to collect xp coins to upgrade your tanks, and to progress in the tech tree. as mentioned earlier, there are less tanks in the blitz version of the game, however, regular updates every month or so add more tanks and armored vehicles into the game.graphics is as previously said, the same as the original world of tanks, but downscaled. the textures are not as sharp, and the models are simplified.overall, it is in my opinion that it's a great game and worth a try for anyone who likes simple and fast tank combat. if the beta is closed on steam but you still want to play this game, you are able to download it on your mobile phone or from the windows store",1

7556,"one of the most engaging mmorpg experiences out there. you never run out of things to do, but you don't feel burdened and guilty for not being productive because everything you do is productive. you can just go around mindlessly killing andand pillaging while enjoying some music for some hours and bang, you have made a lot of useful stuff to use later on. zero research, zero preparation, just go out there and kill stuff.some positive points about the game:- the game's depth varies with your mood and it remains fun. you can play light and casual, you can work the market, you can go hard and achieve great stuff...you can play it any way and still have fun.- graphics are pleasing, unless you really hate voxel stuff.- sound effects and ambience have a nice retro feeling.- market system is pretty straightforward, simple to use and efficient. not a lot of depth though.- you don't need to be anywhere, you can do everything you need without having to visit npc's.- classes are very unique and fun to play.- leveling is smooth.- you can have all classes without spending a single penny, you can switch classes as you please and the class is like a whole different character, with other equipment, and you level each class separately. same as having several characters, but without having to log off to switch between them.- you can be very stylish. the appearance of every equipment you loot is added to your collection, and then you can make your equipment look however you like.- you can build your place (pretty much like minecraft) within a predefined space called a cornerstone. you can spawn your home in any cornerstone you find here and there. why is this useful? intead of having to visit npc's, you build your own workshops and portals in your place and use them. plus, you get to show your friends your unique home! - it's fun to move around. you can glide, you can ride, your can skate on rails, you can sail, you can fly around sitting on a ing majestic rocket flying golden throne!- userbase has low toxicity (for an mmo).- game is light, highly optimized, runs great, looks good.- good servers, low latency and downtime.- high fantasy setting with a comic twist.- many quests to do. none of them feels grindy and they're really useful and rewarding.- the game is grindy in a way that it's doesn't make it feel so grindy. and you can always do some other stuff and have fun.- fantastic and very rewarding crafting system which is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp without being watered down or boring.- fun events.- responsive staff.- few bugs.- no need to partner up. just go out there. the game has a unique and seamless party system that rewards nearby players with exp and loot every time someone is killing, looting or completing a quest, and it will include a limited number among the nearest players. so just go out there, find people and smash stuff together without worrying or even knowing them, the games encourages that.- you can actually convince your normie and casual friends / family and actually enjoy it together, 'cause they won't have to understand much about the game to enjoy it. it can be fun in a superficial way, and is still fun when you get more into it and dive deep into it's systems.on the other hand, there are some negative aspects:- pvp is fun, but it's very far from being the center of attention. there are no open pvp areas in the wilds, there are no turf wars or factions, there are no big battles, there's not much reward in pvp in general. people very into pvp will probably hate it.- everything is too damn colorful. it's a matter of taste, really.- too many notifications.- lacks a minimap.- character building has little depth to it.- not much strategy involved, the game doesn't encourage you to join a clan, organize and make a plan to get things done, like killing a boss.- bgm could use some more tracks. it's always the same track for the same kind of place.- multiple jumping makes most dungeon designs totally pointless. they should at least remove that when you enter a dungeon, it feels like you're cheating and the feeling of accomplishment is overshadowed by the fact that you're basically jumping around mindlessly and ignoring mobs % of the time until you get to the dungeon's last chamber.- sometimes the camera acts like a when you're near walls, if you're in a small room or a narrow passage.- battlefield is a mess. sometimes too many mobs on one place, too many skills and explosions, always too many colors...very often you can't see- i feel that potions aren't the ideal approach to this game in particular. not sure what it could be though. maybe a new potion system, with craftable potions, recipes to collect, levels and different effects.- dungeons very often are generated in a odd way and you loose too much time trying to find the entrance.- classes are not balanced at all, for both pvp and pve. some will always stand out, while others are pretty much useless and not so fun to play.- they should add a proper dashing system so that you could move around more freely.- not a single class can fight while mounted, even the summoners and tamers. like wtf.",1
10020,okay so i dont have many hours on steam but outta of steam i have plenty more but anyways this game is amazing to play with friends and to make friends the pvp and pve are pretty amazing as well if you want a fun co~op game to play with friends then this is your game and if you want something more competitve then the pvp is your spot...and its not pay to win all the items and costumes you can buy in game are great for extra buffs but do not require you to buy them to be good at the game or anything else...if you want my true opinion plenty of people are sss rank in pvp and have never bought a single thing from the item mall...and the game is a bit grindy but what mmo isnt ? i hope this review is slighlty helpful and my literacy isnt to bad for you ~ take it easy and give the game a try.,1
15969,"you'll probably only like this game if you enjoyed aqw. the exp curve is terrible, even if it's supposed to compensate for the low level cap. you'll get to the point where if you want to level up, you'll have to grind certain dungeons a bunch of times, not to mention that they give far less exp than story missions (which you probably can't do if you are grinding the dungeons for exp in the first place).the graphics are nice, with it being capped at fps. everything has good brightness (loving me that bloom). i'm also glad that there's actually sound effects in this game. that spawn-in sound effect is kind of annoying, though.now, the controls are a bit wonky. realistically, no one is going to be comfortable with strafing their character and turning with the same hand. you can control the camera with the mouse, but doing so while moving just makes the camera snap back to its original position, making it a pain to use in combat. controls would be fine if that was fixed.",1
15271,"blatantly rigged. there are times where you do either extremely good or insanely bad, there's never an in-between.it's as if the game decides who's gonna win based on some hidden algorithm, then makes all his opponents land on his tiles meanwhile the preselected winner lands on his cities, empty tiles or chance tiles.oh and if it's your turn to lose, good luck with that. the dice rolls do their best to make you land on the tiles with the highest rent, and if you land on chance, % of the cards will be bad such as the one that makes you land directly to the city with championship.if you start last that's a red flag that the match will be rigged against you, so don't even bother.this has happened so many times that calling it a coincidence would be pretty naive.",0

1479,"fractured space is a game of giant spaceships, stately and graceful motion, and ruthlessly low ttks coupled with strategic and defensive play that can go on for m or more. it's a remarkable example of how you can take the moba archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only looks totally different and plays totally different, but actually builds on the good parts of the genre.many reviews for this game go into the strategic depth (they're right), the tactical depth (they're right) or the mechanical level of complexity (they're mostly right). the game plays well, for the most part, and can easily support thousands of hours of play. but i won't say much more on that.i would like to point out the community management for fractured space is top notch. the community managers know that having a coc and banning people based of it will draw a lot of fire on steam from trolls. but they've stuck to their guns. i have never seen cm's more proactive on banning racists, transphobes, homophobes and even misogynists! it's incredible, and you have to know it comes at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collectives of steam.even the game devs can get punished for bad behavior. while it's rare to see them cross the line, it has happened and the cms have not handed out special treatment.they do this while still being tolerant of the normal outbursts and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming communities. you can disagree with a dev and call them out on it, even in game or on the forums, and they will listen. they may not agree with you or act on what you say, but for such a well-policed community the actual level of debate is very spirited.that's something special and rare all on its own, and ecg deserves a lot of credit for this. it's a real accomplishment all on its own.finally, fractured space's deep gameplay is not marred by monetization mechanics. in general, ecg knows that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modifications and boosters (much like any fp game). but there is no mechanical advantage afforded as of / from any store option. it's a fair game, with a lot of depth. you can play it knowing that while enemies may be better than you, or more coordinated than you, they still have the same tools in their toolkit as you do. and they have stuck to their guns on that stance even though it has caused a lot of short-term problems for them.",1
2378,"poe is the perfect example of rng done very wrong, even for an arpg.i still play for a little while after each expansion, but i always quit for months at a time waiting for the next, because they never fix the biggest problems with the core game.i only recommend it if you enjoy mindlessly grinding the same stale content for hundreds of hours to brute-force abysmal rng while making no meaningful progress.this game has the potential to be amazing, but ggg's stubbornness about insane rng-gated design coupled with the mentally ill community crying when somebody has too much fun will not let that potential be met.progression is a chore. a ton of builds are not viable as the game continues to be balanced around the top .% that have absolutely no life with min-maxed everything. crafting gear you want is borderline impossible. level items can still get level roll tiers. countless build-enabling unique items are very inaccessible. respeccing your passive skills is very expensive and this is exactly the kind of game where you want to be experimenting as much as possible with the passive tree. trading is inconvenient and all manual. most endgame content is gated behind pure rng. no damage numbers, death logs or recaps in any way, which makes understanding what's going on significantly harder. inconsistent enemy balance. extremely overpriced mtx with no way to refund or trade in to get points back. it's impressive that ggg is able to put out big updates every few months, but they never fix the numerous core issues with the game, or they make them worse by balancing around no-life players. i could write a novel about what's wrong with this game from a design standpoint, but that's just more time wasted to poe. if you want to do any endgame content without wasting countless hours, you'll most likely have to buy your way to it, which isn't how it should be designed at all. good luck getting anything done in ssf.it's free(except for stash tabs that are absolutely necessary), that's great, but if you want to slave away on boring tasks, you can go get a job that pays you to do that, then you can buy more engaging games.",0

2885,"look, i'll admit i play more than my fair share, and will continue to play. i don't drop on real world cash on the game, and for good reason. gaijin's entire monetary gain is based on your own frustration and bottlenecking you to put money down. you can play, sure, without spending any money, that's what i do, but the amount of time and effort you're going to expend: it's going to be at least x that of a premium player, and god forbid you want to try any vehicle that is premium based. entire sections of the game (such as italian tanks, most lend-lease/captured vehicles, certain camouflages, etc) are totally locked from players unless they drop real world cash on it or spends insane amounts of time on wagers which are extremely unreliable in themselves.unlike most other games that these days encourage more sportsmanlike fighting, gaijin is the exact opposite: punishing victims of teamkillers and rammers, encouraging spawn camping (both ways) and moreover empowering wallet warriors. from throwing coupons at you, to pointing out every game here's what you would get if you were premium, to parts/fps/re-crewing grinding, and more... gaijen has largely by far created a game that doesn't extract money by tricking you into lootboxes, or loud showy sounds or other psychological trick: it's often pay with your wallet or patience.i won't tell you to not play it, because it can be fun, i find it fun, i really do: but frankly, if you want a dev that actually cares about player feedback, don't play this game. if you want a game that is fully free to play, don't play this game. i could go on but... this became a dead horse beating.the fact of the matter is:for the love of god don't give gaijin your money. they do not need any more encouragement. they really don't. seriously. it's to such a point that you can find statements from gaijjn employees that basically conflate player frustration / grind with profits. and if you're rich and you think this game is for you: don't be fooled. even for the whales, you'll feel the sting of things because notice how i haven't said, it's pay to win. because it's not: moreover, it's pay to avoid spending excess time. you can buy the most expensive things in the game, you could buy every last bit of content in the game with real world cash, and ultimately, it won't give you any increase in skill or anything. you'll still find yourself sucker punched in spawn by a guided rocket, you'll still find yourself being dove on by a chalka, you'll still get that single bullet hitting you that splits your aircraft in two.so just... play it, don't play it... just don't give gaijin more of your cash until they stop abusing the player base.because really, for those who actually shell out cash to this game, it's always an abusive cycle of...legitimate complaints -> introduce shiny new vehicles -> add more microtransactions -> legitimate complaints.it's an abusive cycle, and frankly: it's only going to sour gaijin and the player base more as it repeats.",0

4305,"the game is designed and ran in such as way as to separate you from as much money as possible. decks are being power-crept out of the game practically every month, with a slightly more efficient otk build being released in every new box. near enough every game is decided with a combination of rock paper scissors and a coin flip. are you playing the latest meta deck or a specific counter? if yes, flip a coin. if tails, you go second and otk them for the win, if heads, you go first, watch your board get wiped, and otk'd. there is very little interactivity in the game beyond this at the moment.as a new player you will get enough new gems to pick up the cards you need for the latest otk deck. after this you might even earn enough gems for the next latest. but sooner rather than later you'll find your supply of currency drying up and any sort of vaguely competetive pvp will become impossible (and you are absoloutely screwed if you want to build any of the older archetypes that are often spread accross three or four boxes). at this point you will either quit the game or become a whale, throwing money at it until you suddenly realise just how much fun you /could/ have been having spending that money on something else. if you have the disposable income or are strong-willed enough to grind completely free to play and don't intend to enguage in serious pvp matches you might find some enjoyment. otherwise i would highly recommend avoiding, especially if you lack self control when it comes to freemium.",0

6859,"thius game could be great but so far its horrible. for starters you stuck with a massive grind to even get a pistol. than dont expect fair fights, most the the fights ive been in the match starts with a - to disadvatage or advantage. meaning the game has no auto balance feture, and can easily join a game where you are losing - or even more and are being spawn camped.the class system seems nice but like everything else feels half finished and thrown together. you can switch to another class only after grinding rank and once you join a game as that class, your stuck, there is no planning and you mainly see games fulll of infantry and nothing else becasue you cant change character to one that is needed on the battlefield.the ui and lighting and visual in gerneral frankly are the worse ive seen in a long time. the lighting seems to either bee to bright like you just left a dark room, or too dark and cant see the fogis so horrrible that you normally cant see or make out an enemy till your feet from them. the grapics are dated and poor quality, and the mechanics of the guns and vehicles are even worse.frankly i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone and the excuse that its beta isnt working here. this is another game that will probably never leave early access becasue it gives the developers and excusss to never fix or finish the game.",0

11226,"it does some things right, like taking advantage of its digitial nature, with card gimmicks like warp, which lets you play the card if it was the next card you would draw from the deck. it also does some things wrong, like no card play history left me frantically hitting the replay button to learn more about the card that was just played. yes, there is an instant replay system, although it was often too fast for me to read the cards, (even in slow mode) and some cards don't go to the graveyard where you can read their effects.the tutorial holds your hand a bunch, often forcing you into bad moves to teach a point, until about the last two colors, which makes it easily skippable, since the game already shows hints throughout. it also blocks the screen a bunch with info telling you more about the card effects each time you draw a card with a new effect, which makes it even easier to miss what the opponent is playing.after the tutorial, i started with the gauntlet mode (since it was my first quest), and it was always somewhere between, beating the ai to negative hp or getting mana drought (even with the very nice -mana mulligan system in place to lessen it, yes even in the pre-made beginner decks.) i forgot to mention that the last round of gauntlet always has a gimmick, like the top card of your deck is played instantly, which often results in gimmicks that favor the ai and that the next time you play gauntlet, it's a harder difficulty, which does not benefit players who simply want a quick way to try out various decks with ai or earn quick gold.the worst part is that the ai will often continue playing cards to stregthen it's army, dragging the match on further, even when it has a flying creature you can't block that does lethal damage to you. while it usually makes smart moves, it often plays very slow, which can be annoying when you're losing. this is something i expect from either a player who doesn't realize they won, or one who likes to torment their enemies, not something a bot should do.as for draft and casual games, in my experience, the queue times are only about a minute or less, although if you jump right into casual you're going to be playing pre-built starter decks vs customized player decks unless you buy some packs with in-game currency. the reward system for both gauntelt and draft is good, you get a few loses before it makes you start over, but you always get rewards, usually gold at first, then gold and cards, then gold and card and free booster packs. you also get free random boosters each time you level up one of the individual colors. (i mean random as opposed to specifically giving you more cards of that color.)puzzle mode (or as it's otherwise known win this turn or die to a fire spell) isn't very rewarding as it gives you very little gold, and very little practical application since it's a dumb solution to a hypothetical situation that would never happen in a game (like you having power and types of influence, but your opponent having power types of influence.)gold is used to buy packs about a pack, and gold (you earn at about gold per match if you're a bad player in gauntlet, if you play against players, who often have better cards than you) is required to buy enough for a draft, which you keep the cards from. crystals are for more exclusive stuff (ususally cosmetic stuff when it's only purchasable with crystals). there's a thrid currency called shiftstones, and you get them for beating various objectives, and can earn more by turning in duplicates of cards you don't use, but i still, for the life of me, can't figure out their purpose. i now figured out you have to right-click on cards in collection to craft new ones (you can also destroy cards you hate for more shiftstones).even though i did some find enjoyment playing it, i was often bored and/or frustrated with very long games that rewarded me very little even if i did manage to come out on top. i can't personally recommend this game, because if i had a dollar for each time i conceded a game in casual, i'd have enough money to buy a better game than this.

17444,"in the sake of full disclosure everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life. with that said, and me having gone deep into eq i thought it time to write a proper review of my take on the game good, bad, and the so so.i found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly. the game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.the amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable. over classes (only or need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and races ( of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available). an let's address that quickly. yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, races and classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka rent) and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts. however, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over to hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids. now i went sub, ( i choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations i did not want. however, again i stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like skyrim and have over to hours of free content to see and experience.an while the style of game is dated after years and the combat again very classic everquest or world of warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus. i do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more alive like guild wars or rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.for people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience. you can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo. since this game has been out years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.the only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being years old at this point is the dated ui (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd. definately advise you find a good community, active player base since i think (i do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on. however, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.overall, while this was not everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the everquest saga before the next chapter in everquest starts. to any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world.",1

6991,"there seem to be plenty of reviews from the perspective of people who are ccg veterans, but not many from the ccg novice. i will writing this review as someone for whom tes: legends is their first ccg. i have also been playing the game for about months via the bethesda launcher, so the low hours recorded on steam is not accurate.tesl provides an excellent new player experience for those unfamiliar with ccg mechanics. not only did it gently, but firmly, move me towards understanding the concept of a creature-based card game as a whole, but it also smoothly integrated the game's unique mechanics into the learning process as well, such as the lane and prophecy systems. not only that, but during the story campaign (which serves as an extended tutorial) you are provided with five separate decks for free that allow you to experience different classes and archetypes of play. while it is relatively easy to move through most of the story using these reconstructed decks, the final encounter of the campaign is difficult enough that it forced me into the deck builder to try and craft a deck that was better than the starter decks. while veteran ccg players might scoff at the difficulty of the pve campaign, for a new ccg player, there were some legitimate challenges that forced me to learn the mechanics and think about my choices. as i result, i felt much more prepared for when i began challenging actual humans not long after.as a fp title, the monezation of the game needs to be addressed. overall, i feel that tesl offers great value simply by playing the game, either by winning consistently on the ladder, or by competing in vs/solo arena. all told, it is quite viable to be a fp player and have a lot of fun in the game, and there are plenty of people over on the subreddit who have hit legend using nothing but fp decks. i think it is necessary to mention that i am not a fp player, but given the minimal monetary investment i have put into this game, i feel like i have been provided a solid foundation that allows me to avoid spending money later, rather than feeling like i need to continuously inject cash to stay competitive. for a game that i play casually, this is very important to me, and i imagine many others as well.finally, i need to talk about the setting. as an elder scrolls fan, i love being able to recognize the references in the card collection, and feel that the abilities, artwork, and voice lines all complement the characters they are intended to potray. some of the card references are fairly obscure, too. while odhaviing, miraak, or divayth fyr may be immediately recognizable to many tes veterans, characters such as ahnassi, gortwog, and allena benoch i needed to look up.tl;dr tesl is a great game for people who are new to ccg's as well, and offers a fair fp with a characters that will appeal to tes fans from pretty much any game. i highly recommend. especially given it's free. seriously, it's freee. there is literally no barrier to trying this besides maybe min of download time and possibly a cap on your downloads per month. try it.",1

10107,"i'll make this quick,this game is a ton of fun espically if you're a hunter in real life, there's a lot of negative comments here too about how this game isn't free and it's posing as one (last i checked). it is free indeed, you can hunt three or four animals as a guest and those animals are as followed.whitetailcottontail rabbitpheasant.there's also special events that go on that allows you to hunt certain animals for a certain ammount of time for free, however. if you wish to invest in the game, it's actually a fair deal and they're not asking for a a lot either. ems is worth . usd and months of memberhip is around $ usd, there's obviously other options but those are the two cheapest and it's quite fair if you ask me.overall, i really enjoy this game, it's a lot of fun getting to hunt the animals in the map locations, plus it's really good for time consumption as well. after all, i play this game when i do my homework while sitting in a tree stand or hunting tower lol.either way to sum things up, don't judge this game by the negative reviews until you actually tried it yourself, you may or may not like it and this is as close as hunting i can get when the season for whitetail irl isn't opened.so overall, if you're a fellow real life hunter as myself here, you'll enjoy the game!",1

2958,"currently the game is no longer fun. gaijin is just over the entire community (unless your russian) and only see's us for the money in our wallet. we have been bring up, pointing out, and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse. the only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they 'might' pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel. however this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel. oh, by the way, they are under a nda which makes them completely worthless to begin with. an obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from gaijins part. the t-- for example very rarely catches fire, explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly, and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank. there was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a . spread between vehicles to .. so for example tiger ii's dont have to fight tanks from the korean war. last i checked the poll was at about , for yes and ~ for no. gaijin has offically stated they will not change the br system and that it is perfectly fine. despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree.if you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier is playing russian vehicles. also on a observasional note, the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations. just saying, they seem to be paying more attention to (a) certain nation than others.as the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste you'r money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian. the only reason i have not stoped playing thiscompletely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it.",0

12092,"bless online is just another mmorpg from south korea. it's similar to blade and soul, tera online, etc. there are races in the game, human, elf, animal-man and halfling. supposedly, players were supposded to have generic classes; assassin, guardian, mage, ranger, paladin, berserker, warlock and mystic. due to some reason, there are no warlocks or mystic classes. bless online is an incomplete game with no storyline. however, it does have nice visual effects and voiceovers.gameplay-wise, wasd keys and mouse. the actions are extremely complicated for a d mmorpg. you need a tutorial to guess how to setup your skills into your skill bar. their user interface (ui) is horrendously designed. it's similar to the world of warcraft ui design but you can see that it has been made worse and far more complex.conclusion, bless online is destined to die from mmo glut. there is nothing special to differentiate it from all the other world of warcraft clones. world of warcraft is also dead. the pay to win shop with lumena is just another nail in its coffin. it's not playable. my recommendation is to burn bless online, learn from the experience, iterate and make something better. graphics should not be your focus, gameplay is. the quality isn't there yet and i foresee pretty visuals but with no substance.note: bless online is published by neowiz games. their ceo is jacob han. they have already closed their russian and south korean servers and it's about time to shut the game down and move on.link to table for mmo glut visual effectsnice and glowy arrows. pretty nice.. voice overspretty good.. animated cut-scenesvery cliche to have the manga kneel-and-scream but animated cut-scenes for a generic quest. effort.. quest auto runit's convenient and it helps to simplify the process. china online click, naruto facebook games, russian warcraft clone, journey to the west facebook games had it too. it's only a very, very minor boost.. ww sprintmuch better than shift + w.cons. no story or world to capture your imaginationbless online really generic. you have races. the human race, the elf race, the animal man race and the halfling race. it's like tera online with its complex keyboard actions.. low player populationit's dying and steam is its last gasp for hope.. bad key positioningwasd keys. you have no side stepping on the wasd keys. it's replaced by q & e. . pay to win shopthis time the cash shop currency called lumena. ing stupid idea.. bad interaction key, ff for interacting? what is this? what happened to left-click, open quest?. bugsi ran out of the zone for the elf queen's quest, quest bugged and my game couldn't continue from that point onwards. i couldn't even cancel the quest.. tutorial is horribleone of the worst tutorials i have ever seen. it's so overly complicated. a tutorial is meant to simplify the game for you, not make it more complex.. f does not work well with steam's taking screenshot ftoo close to each other. accidentally pressed f while taking screenshots.",0

11537,"a couple things i would like to address are the money aspect of the game. right now the game is not pay to win (as that can change in the future but hopefully we dont make that turn) they offer in-game currency to be able to obtain weapons with skins on them (no the skins dont make the stats any better than the normal gun) not to mention the in-game currency isnt extremely expensive and they give you a good amount for what you pay. now lets move on to the gameplay aspect, the game is perfect for anyone who likes fast paced type games. the game has imaculate hit reg so nothing to complain about in that region of gameplay. the one thing that they could change would be spray patters in my opinion. i have played alot of fps games and the recoil in those games are more easier to control, the recoil in this game seems like its just random at times and if we could get reliable recoil patters for the game that would make this game ten times better. other than that / best fp shooter on steam. and another thing you can literally run this game on a potato!",1

13006,"i can't recommend this game in good conscience, even though it is a free-to-play.i played it a lot on android - about days length. it's a lot of fun, especially in the beginning as you keep unlocking new stuff.after a while, though, it will become tedious and even frustrating, as you feel the need to micromanage every single dweller to min/max and expand your vault, all while keeping out all the threats and exploring the outside.there is no endgame. after a certain point, you just keep expanding, exploring and dealing with threats in an endless, meaningless cycle, grinding away for better gear and weapons, all to explore for longer and kill monsters faster, which gets you nowhere fast.another negative point is the fact that it's an android port to pc, of a game that depends on time passing to replenish your gauges and completing tasks. when i played it on android, i could take out my phone/ tablet a couple of times during the day and play for - minutes, which i feel is the way the game is meant to be played. when i sit at the pc to play, i expect to be engaged for (possibly) hours at a time, which this game will not provide, especially at the beginning.all in all, you can expect a few entertaining days/ hours of play, better experienced on android, but with a rapidly declining amount of fun after unlocking most of the game's content. don't expect an end.",0

6633,"i really wish i could recommend this game. i really do. but i just can't. there are so many flaws in this game that just leads me to a 'no.'.the gameplay in this is actually pretty fun. it's not your typical cod game where you're a one man army (unless you are a pay to winner, which is a different story.). there are multiple branches of the militaries, each with their own unique vehicles and weapons. same goes with the three factions; united states, germany, and the soviet union. but it just takes so damn long to level up it's a pain. all of these branches have a rank requirement, fyi. it took me a while to get to level making around - of a score each round. i like a good challenge personally, but it takes such a long time to level up once you get there.each weapon has its own different stats. weight, space it takes up, damage, etc. one weapon might look like it sucks, and it might, but it's all dependant on how you use them. some weapons might also one-shot you. it's annoying, even when you know you were at full health. but a headshot almost always one-shots. i don't know what else is happening, if it was in the torso. it's annoying as hell honestly, and some weapons need to be balanced.pay to winning is a constant annoyance. yes, the game is free and the developers need to make money, i understand that. i even bought some gold to support the developers when i thought this game was good at the time. they are hard at work and do deserve it, but the pw is just horrible. you could've just unlocked the 'tank crew' class and if you had enough gold, you could immediatly cheat your way to get the most powerful tank in the game.the quality in this game is meh. the graphics are pretty good for what it is. it isn't a top-tier graphical game, which i personally like as it doens't take as much memory and doesn't ruin your fps. the gun sound quality though. i hate it. it sounds like you're firing a paint ball gun and nothing real at all. i don't care for this, but it makes me feel like this is something the developers neglected. overall: /. this game needs work. it has it's ups and downs. if there was a sideways button labeled 'meh' i would've chosen it. but this isn't the game for you if you're not a patient person, or could easily rage. play it if you want, but you will run into some problems.",0

14545,"my first review about this game was positive because i was mainly playing the single player mode. after a few hours, that was not enough anymore then i started to play team deathmatch and battle arena. at td there's no reason to play serious. even if you get top score, if you die you'll receive the same bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match (after do some damage to an enemy, only). there's no teamwork because only the top score alive at the end of the match will receive the protonium box, so is just a race for kills and points. if by any chance you finish the match alive, but you did no damage to an enemy, you'll not receive any box: score = box, even on the winning team.ba has (usually) better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base, but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast, my main complain about this game is:there's no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and cubes as base, just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design.",0

8948,"this game is really hard on new players. you need to play for a good time and join a good squad that will give you orders if you want to contribute. a really skil-based game. lots of team playing, and a lot of communication. you can use a jetpack to get on top of a building, and basically fire upon a group of enemies, you can go invisible, sneak up behind someone and stab them, you can even use a armor shield buff to tank a bunch of damage and kill a player even if he is shooting at you first. there are also vehicles in the game to choose from, even vtol's and carrier's. lots of utilities like c's spawn beacons, and sensors to aid your team. however, you will mostly find yourself dying repetedely out of nowhere. there is a major skill gap, and most of the player base nowadays is veterans. that is exactly why you stick with good players and squads. overall a fantastic and under-rated game. it's not really that paywin, it's more of a grind to get good items. but it's a challenging grind, and it's basically playing the game, so it's more of a progession system. /-you'll find a lot of players with high ping, because there are so many of them, so it can get a bit annoying to see an enemy teleport randomly and kill you.",1

1886,"i really love this game, and if you like moba then you should try it, the gameplay should not be hard to understand, a big map divided into three routes (top, mid and bot), two teams of players (vs), many heroes with different ability and tasks (support, carry, tank), the goal of the teams is to reach the enemy base by destroying enemy tower and minions, there are lots of mechanical and things to learn but it'svery simple if you take time to read a guide or/and play the tutorial. one suggestion is to not get depressed by elitist person who will tell you things like: f**k you, your dad, f***ing ss! etc. because there are lot of people like that.however, in my opinion what makes dota different from other moba is the tactics / strategies usable, well balanced (recently i've some doubt xd), based heavily on skills, a lot of heroes to choose to play and have fun with, totally free and frequently updated.one of the biggest problems i found is communication, for example when you select eu server and english language, the game start and is most of time like..me: hello guys ^^team:привет другteam:merhaba arkadaşımteam:hola amigateam:朋友你好",1

11254,"the game ai is stacked against the player in a way that cheapens the experience. for example, if you are building a new deck to test out in gauntlet mode, at first your build may seem to be working, but once you get to the th round, the ai will either short you sigils for the power you need to play your cards or not give you any sigils at all, even if you stack your deck with ample sigil aquisition cards. this happens out of every times you attempt to play. and then if you do manage to beat gauntlet if you try using the same deck again without significant changes to your cards, it will go into kill mode and usually wipe you out in the first round. just try it. build a deck and play gauntlet for about hours without changing your deck. you will get to a point that you simply cannot win with a deck that was working perfectly before due to bad card draws and op perfect ai card draws to bring you to exactly hit points no matter what you do. and if you happen to get within a couple of hundred gold to having enough gold to play forge or draft ( or ), you can forget about winning any ranked games either. you will hit a losing streak of - hands in a row due to bad sigil draws again! absolutely ridiculous. i've pumped weeks of my time into this game thinking that i had the wrong cards or imperfect builds. nope! you will just get shafted on your sigil pulls, either way too many or none at all, then you're just screwed!",0

3989,"you want a review? well even if you didn't i'm giving you one anyways. tf is not like most fps games, let alone one that is free to play. tf is the sequel to a game known as team fortress classic, a mod using the unreal tournament engine. blah blah blah historical stuff i prolly got wrong. anyways: tf is quite simply an amazing game, with different classes, each with their own unique roles in a successful match.. scout: he runs fast, capping intel, capping control points, and pushing the bomb cart with the power of people! warning, since he runs so fast and has a double jump, allowing for high evasiveness, hes also pretty squishy, having a measly base health. . soldier: soldier is a powerhouse, holding base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies. his rocket jumping ability (though this takes a lot of practice to fully master) can get him to the point even faster than a scout! . pyro: the most controversial class, having base health, medium-paced walking speed, and a short-ranged based primary (the flamethrower), pyro can be seen as the weakest class. while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies, they really just don't know how easy it is to counter her. (one second though: pyro can airblast projectiles and extinguish burning teammates by using m, or mouse ).. demoman: arguably the most powerful class in the game, demoman is here to bring diversity to the game. (y'know, because hes scottish). anyways, demoman, while having the same health as pyro, has one distinct advantage: the stickybomb launcher. this bad boy does damage per sticky, meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played. . heavy: also considered one of the weakest in the game (especially without a medic latched onto him /) heavy is the mascot for tf. this bald, bear wrestling, russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game, but rather the comics (which even then he realy kind of doesn't). heavy has health! wow! you must think, until you learn his disadvantages. he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game, making him easy to pick off from afar. . medic: oh boy. medic is the second fastest class in the game, just after scout. he also has base health.your cod-washed mind might think hey wheres his souper smg ding? well thats because tf's medic is actually here for healing. sure, he has a syringe gun (which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn) but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that, as he'd die near instantly. (each class has their own way of dealing + damage in one shot, though this is mostly up to crits/ actual skill). instead, medic uses his medigun, a long, black, healing device that can patch up your teammate's wounds in seconds! plus, when you have full ubercharge you can either have increased healing, full invincibility, % chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit, or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack, and gives you health for the damage the person you're healing recieves. . engineer: engineer builds sentries, dispencers, and teleporters. sentries will guard an area, sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets (and rockets when your sentry reaches max level). dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates. teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other, however, all these buildings require a lot of care, as they are susceptable to many attacks, and will do no damage to stock ubers (the kind that grants full invincibility). and since you'll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot, engineer only has health.. sniper: sniper, if played right, can outdamage demoman! even though sniper only has health, he has the longest range out of every class, what with a sniper rifle and all. sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than seconds. the sniper rifle isn't like most sniper rifles in other games. having good aim is essential to playing sniper, as his main source of damage is getting headshots, otherwise he'll normally do only damage. . spy: spy is a real sneaky rat. he can diguise as any class, sap buildings (turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper), his main deal is that he can backstab enemies. backstabbing someone is always an instant kill, with only for a few exceptions. tf is a great game, and i suggest you look into it.",1

1647,"this is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.dota requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. to make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. one team often has better players than the other right from the start.neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in - minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.i have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the casual mode of dota , then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.after remaining in a miserable - minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. in dota it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. the time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of or people, and you're the outsider; in this case, the abuser won't want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. so point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn't always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing casual about unranked as a result.the only casual dota , is modded dota . unfortunately most of the servers for that are in peru & run likethis is a free game, so there isn't much risk in trying it, but there are other games in this genre that don't force you to endure unfair or abusive - minute matches, so i'd recommend you try those first.",0

11233,"i have a lot hours in this game and i think i can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game. also the review i'm giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competively than casually. let's start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldn't be in here. - card decks: the decks that you make have to be cards instead of the standard that are common in most other games. this makes deckbuilding and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare. there are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game (and trust me i built them), but with cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced. the deck size should be cards, and then you have a card side board (though sideboards don't matter in this game either and i'll explain later). - mulligan: doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb. in this game if you don't like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven. unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason, so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause youre stuck with it. let me give you an example of how it should be. if you ever played magic the gathering (another better card game) before, the way their system works is like this, you start with seven cards if you don't like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to four cards, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to three (though this never happens) etc, etc... the point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason. - coin flip: normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing. eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you have to go first. now in other games when you do a coin flip, the winner has the option if they want to go first or not, i know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first (it doesn't happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to). this is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesn't trust their player base to make their own decisions. - best out of one: this is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore. for some reason ranked matches are a best of one, basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank. sometimes in games you are bound to get unluckly with draws but thats why in most other cards games when you play competively, you play your opponent the best of three. for the life of me i have no idea why the game is like this, i can't begin to tell you how absoultely frustated you will feel when you are playing ranked, and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you can't cause eternal only allows two for some reason, and you wind up losing the game cause of it, but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up. it's absoultley ridculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competive play. - unbalanced cards: some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken, and by that i mean you essentially have no way to lose. some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essientially has no way to win, the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first, i've played tons of other card games before (magic, hearthstone, yu-gi-oh, pokemon) and i can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards i've ever seen. - drafing sucks: finally the last point that i want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game. for drafting in eternal you aren't drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go, instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people (there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here), these drafts aren't with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built. also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is cards, this isn't as much of a big deal since you draft cards in total but i just find it odd. also draft matches are not the best out of three, they are again the best out of one. it's so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from, so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it, so if you get awful hands well too bad f@#$ you cause now you lose the match.here is the good things about eternal... - it's free and it will only take you hours of grinding to get a semi good deck if you don't want to spend money.overall, if you are looking for a card game to play online to take more seriously just go play hearthstone, magic online, or magic arena.",0

2506,"hello friend, as a player who has put over hours into this game over the course of more than five years, and being among the most qualified players on the whole of the steam platform to review this game, i can unequivocally tell you, do not involve yourself in war thunder. do not pay money into this game. what follows, in no particular order, is a list of grievances: the development of this game has been like a car crash in slow motion. wt includes pay to win elements, gambling mechanics aimed at children, russian nationalism, loot boxes, and one of the most degenerate and coercive free to play economies that has ever been implemented in a video game. the game is fundamentally flawed in terms of vehicle balance and matchmaking is a disaster. queue times for end game content go on for upwards of minutes for matches that are essentially vacant; six player teams. datamining has revealed evidence that russian vehicles in the game were equipped with hidden modifiers that increased their survivability. the grind is hollow and unrewarding even when you pay for a premium membership/ vehicle. the wt community is toxic in a way that makes cod and lol look like dolphin swim adventure. these people hate each other and everything around them. behaviors include racisim, misogyny, homophobia, etc., with rampant teamkilling, mission sabotage, and hate messaging. gaijin's community management/ public relations is a dumpster fire and everyone i know dislikes them personally. the moderators of the war thunder forums employ a draconian form of censorship that silences and disappears crticism of the game, while punishing the forums authors with user bans. bugs and historical inaccuracies in the game remain present over the course of years, and are ignored by the developers even when historical documents are provided for them. the developers are drowning the game in new currencies and markets. events in wt now revolve around a counterfeit marketplace where the event itself is no longer designed to be fun or entertaining, but with the goal of pressuring the player to pay into the marketplace in order to unlock game content. wt employs a round robin system of rebalancing which artificially and ahistorically changes the behavior of vehicle ammunition, armor, etc. in order to influence the style of play. the developers use this technique in order to force players to grind through game content, rather than simply allowing them to play where they feel most comfortable. this is not an exhaustive list.all my love and affection,- kwkp.s. free parts and fpe!",0

2125,"of exile: an action rpg similar to style and feel of great titles like diablo . path of exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other arpgs. from the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of wraeclast itself, it’s a unique enough experience that i haven’t encountered anything quite like path of exile before. its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of arpgs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement. the game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. the story and lore of wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most arpgs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. the game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other arpgs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. overall the experience of path of exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. personally, i would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. as a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully i can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these won’t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. path of exile is a great arpg, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers + of content for a first time through the entire game and it’s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -double thumbs up from royialvideo reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/royialnetwork",1

11646,"freestyle is a free to play mmo basketball game which is both awesome and nerve-wracking at times. first, i'll get into the positives and then i'll rant about the major issues.to begin with, it's a street basketball, thus, it's played on one basket, there are no fouls, no free throws, etc. matches last minutes, they have overtimes and replays. i won't be going into the details about the basketball itself because it's self-explanatory. next, in order to jump into the match, you must pick a position and create a character which is customizable to an extent. then you'll be launched into a really confusing lobby screen with tons of options. you'll notice card sets, toys (mascots), sh*tload of events and so on. next, there's training mode which is essential for a newbie. you'll get a chance to practice every ability of your chosen position. those skills, if not yet acquired, will be available to buy in skill shop as you level up. for more flashy moves you can try equipping freestyles.my problem with this game is that there are a lot of microtransactions which affect your stats and gameplay. you can get stuff like new characters with additional skill points, buffed items and other stuff which increases your abilities and gives you an advantage. though, it's possible to get them without spending real money but it's pretty tough to do so and only available during certain events.furthermore, there are many bugs, crashes, freezes and connection stability issues and they show up pretty often and haven't been fixed for too god damn long. besides, many people state that there's a bitcoin miner inside the game files.. that's a first.tl;drpros:● fun gameplay● addictive● challenging● a wide choice of clothes, accessories, cards, toys, skills, freestyle, etc● non-stop events● great and fitting musiccons:● slightly paywin● many bugs, crashes, freezes, connection issues● bitcoin miner inside the game● unchangeable character appearance except for clothes, accessories and hair● salty communityoverall, this game is so fun and competitive but also has so many problems that prevent me from giving this game a /",1

13034,"first they came to our phones... then they came to our computers... at last, they came to steam...this game has made very little changes and from the start it was almost a clicker game where you would have to click on the production rooms to gather the supplies they make, and for a phone game it can be understandable, but not really okay by me.the game would have been by far a better game if it was made more as a strategy game where power, food and water was continously gathered but always went up or down, so if you were heading towards too low you had to make a new room or find better people working that room, rather than just risk setting everything on fire and continue the clicker game basics where they started.it's free, so why not give it a try? at best you'll love the boring gameplay and eventually find the quests okay, or at worst, you won't play past day .",0

6764,"besides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something (or you could just spend real money to buy it... because its that kinda game!), i would have to say this game sucks. from the realistic gameplay, the completely balanced factions, or maybe the realtime wars that players influence, i would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says!lets start with the free to play part! it, as stated above, can take upto weeks just to get enough money and xp to buy a weapon. however! if you think that you're above this, and don't want to wait, you can just spend the ~ us dollars to buy it right there and then. (buying it with credits even allows you to completely skip over the xp requirements, along with the money!)then comes the realistic and simulation battles- if one could call them that! i believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model, which although had some nice hopes... is for lack of better words, sh*t. many a times i have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas, when i get into a firefight with another soldier. mid shooting, my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isn't in position (because apparently my gun was running into some invisible force?) for firing. then theres the maps... oh! how i hate all of the maps. from large open areas with almost no cover from base to base, to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful, or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog? all in all, the maps aren't that great either, simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game.after that, there goes the balance which just as everything before is little but existent. i'd like to paint a little picture for you here... american bombing planes: bombsgerman bombing planes: bombsoviet bombing planes: bombs! (kinda crazy right?)but, the german plane must have some redeeming qualities right? like better mobility, or stronger bullets? nope, its the exact same as the other, if not worse. after the planes comes the tanks and weapons. (i'd like to just say real quick, germany is easily the most underpowered, and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better, or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the soviets into the game, which look to have the best weapons.) from the poor guns of the german, to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the american weapons, to the overly good starting soviet guns, its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction well over others. tanks/vehicles, while pretty well balanced, are very overpriced, and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction. all in all, the game's balance seems to be lacking, and its actually rather annoying to see the devs. favor some factions over others...those real-time wars you were expecting? or that huge scale battles that you thought you were going to get? wrong again! while yes, there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on, and are ranked, most battles are only v . this looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the class variety that the game has, leading to searching for game up to minutes (and thats without a squad... being in a squad can take ages). finally, after getting into a game, you may notice that the whole server consist of just that class, or very few other... you can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay, and overly long searching time for a game that it may 'plop' you in, which ends roughly a minute after your joining! (also, i'm not really going to approach the whole, campaign thing, as its seems to literally be pointless. wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction... but you can almost always bet the germans lose, even when they win?)all in all, this game really in a trainwreck, that yes, i have had some fun playing, needs a lot (and i cant stress enough how much i mean that) of work. also, before you say, oh well you've spent almost hours playing the game, it must be good! i would like to state that i have only spent that much time in game because i wanted to be able to expierence a large portion of it so that i may give a proper rating and suggestions!",0

14024,"compared to the majority of previous...attemps at making this game what it could of been, i believe it has hit closest to home. having beginner servers where it feels like the pvp is equally matched, as well as a place where new players can experience the overly done amount of loot is great, as when you hop on an official server that has high population, there's no doubt that you'll be popped in moments by a sniper depending on where you are (that's a downfall, but the majority of the time this can be avoided by just carefully selecting a server). the game mode 'battle royale' is great fun, but it feels like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top and don't come in the top . i find that i reach the top in a good amount of games, only to die before getting to the top as people with heavy amounts of meds can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle is tiny, so they can easily pick you off. the pvp servers are good, if you have already gathered a mighty stash worth of guns that you really don't care about losing (a lot of game time till these servers become viable i believe).the warmup servers helpful as you don't lose your gear, but you do lose your consumables, so you need to bring a whole lot of meds & ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warming up.overall, this type of game is still toxic, but a lot better than the previous ones and it does seem like it's heading in the right direction, there's bad parts, but good counter parts.",1

3881,"i have one very specific complaint now.the new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my tf experience. introducing the forced bo format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. and most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.now why do i hate this? the old tf was unique to me in that when i went into a game, probably on a server i knew and had in favourites, i could meet or make some friends or rivals. and the rivalry has been the key concept of tf since its beginning -- might i remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.in the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if i'm going to be playing with different people minutes from now. but marekk you old , why not go to a community server if you like them so much? well tell you what, community servers are dead, and not without help from the official servers' availability. of course, official infrastructure is a blessing. and it was working perfectly well for a long time before this new matchmaking arrived, and it was great.but what did we trade that for? the god awful meaningless badges that you can tap on in the menu to make a funny noise?i feel like we're all strangers now in this game... ;_;",0
1497,"this game has free updates and hasn't disappointed me yet from its new features every time i come back to playing it, new cosmetics, new ships, new events and all for free. coming back to playing this game reminds me why i like the devs of this game since it keeps increasing content over time.",1
13817,"i've been playing the game for several years now as a tester, the gameplay is up to the standard of any competitive multiplayer you can name. it's matured to the point the balance changes are made with the aim of keeping things fresh instead of putting out fires. there are very few other games that can give you the same feeling that dreadnought provides, and none that i've played recently. the visual aesthetics are fantastic, and with the steam release the game now has audio to match that gravitas.i am a fan of the fluidity of the new ui introduced for the steam release as well. it needs some refinement* but over all it is much slicker and more modern than the previous iteration. i reccommend this game to all fans of the vehicle shooter genre. it is familiar enough that anyone who has played mech warrior online, star conflict, fractured space, crossout, roblox, etc. will be able to get into the hotseat right away. and at the same time it is a different beast altogether, i guarantee you'll enjoy the feeling of unstoppable power that comes with piloting a ship the size of a city block.*some resizing to follow pc ui conventions, higher res module icons, better menu mapping to reduce number of clicks needed, and get rid of that ugly edit ship button",1
3666,"team fortress aka tf is a free to play, multiplayer, first person shooter (fps), and a hat (cosmetic) simulator. a very fun game. especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class.classes & teams: there're about classes in the tf: [offensive classes:] scout, soldier, pyro, [defensive classes:] demoman, heavy (weapons guy), engineer, [support classes:] medic, sniper and spy.each class has it's own strength and weakness. for example, spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you.tf has teams: blu and red. they hate each other, and they attack each other. nothing interesting.maps (levels) & gamemodes:maps can be different (pretty obvious). but unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like i said before, each class has it's own weakness. for example, sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed. each map has it's own gamemode. here is a list of all official gamemodes:capture the flag (ctf)control points (cp)territorial control (tc)payload (pl)payload race (plr)king of the hill (koth)medieval modespecial delivery (sd)mann vs machine (mvm)robot destruction (rd)arena (arena)mannpowerand here is a list of unofficial gamemodes:highlander (tfcenter.com)v (tfcenter.com)saxton hale mode or freak fortress (vsh)randomizerslender fortress (sl)prop hunt (ph)dodgeball zombie fortress surfing (surf)jail breakfortwarsand many more.hats/cosmetics: you don't need them to play a game. players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. most of them, spend about $ on the game, only because of the hats. players also care about the qualities of the items. some qualities can be very expensive, so i don't suggest to spend money on crap. however, hats are not the only ones. players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins.if you really want to get hats, then i suggest you to read this guide: you want more hats, then i suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the tf trading community, and about trading itself. here is a guide: updates: there are different kinds of tf updates: official updates and community created updates (they're official, too). what's the difference, you ask? well, it's pretty simple:official updates - are created by the main creator/company called valve. in their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a % chance that valve is going to add new hats, made by the community from the steam's workshop.community created updates - valve usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning valve doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (however, valve added community maps only in the beginning, when tf was still new and fresh. but now everything is different, because in nowadays tf became as a very popular game.) so like i said before, valve actually cares what community creates. so valve likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. but majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. and to be honest: it's normal. if you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called end of the line, and it was actually the most useless update in the tf. it had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats. before an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called snowplow with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by valve. valve said, that the map is too confusing for new players. later, that sentence became as a meme, because other maps made by valve are more confusing, than a snowplow. anyways, let's move on:unbalanced gameplay & weapons: tf has kinds of players: fp (free to play) players (aka noobs) and pp (premium to play) players (aka experienced players). imagine blu team full of noobs, and red team full of experienced players. is this a balanced match? heck no. reds would win every bloody match. however, in valve servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. here is a list current voting types:kick playerrestart the matchchange level/next levelscramble teamsdisable team autobalanceeternaween (allow halloween-restricted items for two hours. player must have an item to enable this voting choice.) so imagine again those teams again: imagine, that you joined the blu team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. so you decide to vote to scramble teams. so what do you think what's going to happen? the voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun and because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting.now let's talk about weapons, shall we? nah, let's not, because valve finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. i could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. i will still save this title, just in case.the story: well there is a story in the tf, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. you can only find it in the official tf comics. you can find comics in the official tf website, right here.[www.teamfortress.com]the community: the community was great, until tf became for free. right now, if you go to any official valve server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. i hope your ears doesn't explode. to be honest, tf community is still great. it depends where you live. usually, i really love to play with americans. i never loved to play with europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless. how cruel!what is a premium account? premium account means an upgraded account. in the beginning you can only have backpack slot. if you buy something from the mann. co store (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have slots in your backpack. it's very important to have a premium account, because backpack slot if not enough for you. i suggest you to buy a mann co. supply crate key. once you bought something from the mann co. store - don't use it again. use it only to buy keys. once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!)overall, my rating is out of .remember: once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it.everything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things.also, i am very sorry if i was very rude or mad in this review. it's because sometimes, tf can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. if you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.have fun! ^.^",1

1422,"overview:a fast-paced territory control game set in space with five players per side. before the game starts, you select a ship available to you, and possibly make modifications to your crew and armament (except in the secondary frontline mode where you are assigned a ship semi-randomly). once in the game, the objective is to capture your enemy's home station while defending your own. to assist in the objective, you must capture resource stations that passively generate income which is used to upgrade your team's ships.gameplay:the frontline game mode has only one sector and allows warp jumps within the sector, but the main conquest game mode has five sectors, and allows jumps only from sector to sector: one home sector per team, two lane sectors (alpha and beta) with three mining stations and a forward station per team each, and a central gamma sector with a base that can be captured at certain times during the game in order for the team to gain a short-term overall buff. in order to get to your enemy's home sector, you must capture the enemy's forward station in one of the lane sector which will allow your team to jump from that lane to the enemy's home. if the game goes on long enough, capturing the base in gamma will permit your team to jump to the enemy's home from any sector. each home base has stationary defenses that can be destroyed by the enemy.progression:after the game you will be awarded experience and credits which can be used to unlock new crew, ships, and weapon loadouts from the ones available to you in one of three tech trees. there are three manufacturers with a unique aesthetic each, but ships are broadly classed into offense defense and utility. you can spend money to buy platinum to purchase new skins.cons:-early access. small player population, things constantly change, ships and loadouts are re-balanced, bugs. the game is not done. it has been in ea for a while and i've had the pleasure (?) of seeing it evolve, it has come leagues from where it started. the ui has improved considerably, the game has become more optimized, awful game-crashing bugs have been removed. but ultimately you are paying to beta-test a game. even if you paid no money by getting in on one of the free periods, you are paying with your time. unless you really want to play this game right now, wait. it will be better when you do decide to play it.-difficult. skill and situational awareness is a big factor in a team's success. until you have played for a while, it is hard to say what you should be doing right now. flanking? warping to gamma? engaging in combat? distracting the enemy? back-capping? each ship plays differently: some are slow, others are fast. some ships fire better from broadside, other ships fire better head-on. some ships can charge in head-first, others cannot. some require stealth and waiting, some require you to zip around in -d space and orient yourself correctly. there is a lot of depth here: this is not a casual game!-teamwork-focused. the game tries to balance teams, but teamwork is hard to quantify and predict. a moderate amount of teamwork will result in leagues better overall performance. and then you get a player on your team that doesn't know how to fly their ship, and you start the slow slog towards losing the match.pros:+looks beautiful with amazing attention to detail. the ships activate tiny side-thrusters when you turn. the ship turrets articulate individually as you move your reticle around. explosions, beams, rockets, railguns, and all similar effects look fantastic and carry proper weight to them. +challenging and deep. see difficult above. it is fulfilling to gain mastery, and this game delivers it in spades.+good progression. the game has a short tutorial mode that teaches basics. ship selection is limited at the start and requires that players through some simple ships in order to unlock others. but do not think that the simple ships are in any way bad! the later ships are just more specialized, and by the time you get to them you will have hopefully realized the niche that the ship fills. in some ways, situational awareness is more important than how good you are with a ship. your ship skills will broadly transfer between ships, but situational awareness wins games, and it does not depend on your ship.+good pacing. the game has been fine-tuned in such a way that it feels like there is always something to be doing, but not so much going on that you don't know what to do first.verdict:recommended, provided that you can handle it being in early access and are ok with a non-casual game.",1
4265,"game consists of luck and random. no skill can be used if random gives you + lvl monsters from a start and useless at that point spells. and more over - if you want good cards pray to all gods you know and draw cardpacks (not , coz good cards distributed among many) till your wallet is dry, coz gems you recieve will be never sufficient and opponents will almost always have their deck build to a full. its ok when you face ai controlled opponents, coz their deck is almost always weak, but if there is an event with pvp, heh... good luck than. and i am done with that greedy game.",0
5086,"okay, i have been proven wrong before when i have enjoyed a game in beta, but i really hope this goes through into actual full release.when people say it is like smash they are right. when thy say it is a smash clone, they couldn't be any more wrong.the basic set up is very smash-esque but the play is a style in its own right. you play on a d stage with minor elements of hazzard such as pit falls and smashing an opponent off the stage which is all very smash like.but where it comes into its own is its style of combat. you all start off bar fistedwhich all have the same move set of a straight knuckle, upper and sweep to knock an opponent off.but each character has two sets of weapons which you obtain randomly from pick ups in on the stage, a good few seem they are cloned but most have their own unique combat style and flare, making no two the exact same to play as. you also play with low gravity and a lot of moves capable of keeping you air born, making for some cool air born fights and juggles. even when it seems to be over when you are falling to your death, you can make an epic come back when you use the right moves from the edge of the stage.the combat style is what i love the most though about the game. it is all fast, all go with no time to rest, yet it flows really nice and keeps you excited, even if you are losing you are still just enjoying the rush and pace.to top off, each character has their own bio and are quite unique in the looks department and varied. there is quite a selection already and can't wait to see what other characters they release and what new weapons they include.all in all if you like smash, get it! if you like a decent and developing fighting experience with quirky characters, get it! if you just want a game to let off steam on or just enjoy pvp, get it!",1
