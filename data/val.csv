17745,"i always enjoy teaching ppl how to play games. it's often the case in roblox whenever there's a game that has a level-up system, it's almost explicitly required for higher lvl players to help lower lvl players. there's always the troller, of course, but whenever i join a game and theres high-tier players willing to help, it's such an enjoyable experience and then, once i meet them up in the big leagues, i join their ranks to help others. i've seen it mostly in the infinity rpg game. feels good the whole time.edit: well, at times it's hard to teach when there's skill involved. manual mechanics, like in overwatch or eso, may be harder to help translate for a new player. it's often like trying to teach someone a language you just learned in my opinion. sometimes it's just *your* language or behavior that makes you good with the character you're using. you develop it to where it's no longer just you telling yourself what to do, but it eventually becomes instinct. teaching a new player is basically dumbing it down again. i've seen it have repercussions on the teacher at times.eh, it's still worth it in the end, because then you've got someone who plays like you, so playing together becomes that much more fun and easy. hopefully. i know some ppl still take their own behavior into it and play their own way anyways...",1

11503,"i have played almost every single major online fps that has been released in the last years and the hours i have put into this game are enough for me to know that it is absolutely one of the best i have played. for me it is a perfect mix of counter strike and call of duty (apart from the fact it uses counter strikes moving while firing mechanics - there is absolutely no jumpshotting or firing snipers while moving in this game, and its best to stay pretty still in general which i hate in video games, but each to their own).mechanically this game is sound, i like the map designs and i like the objectives (tdm, cs type objectives, and a domination type mode where each team has to protect their bases from being destroyed by enemy gunfire, explosives, and usually, knives). i like the weapons and i've never seen a game where preference is so subjective. in call of duty i did tend to stick to certain guns but hand me any ar and it'll do the same job as any other. this game has wildly different guns so it's fun to experience different ones and find out what works for you, you don't really want to google best guns as each person will definitely have different tastes. these are the bulk of the microtransactions, but it's a really solid fp experience and absolutely not pw at all. i got the most powerful sniper in the game on my first day without making a purchase and bought an ak and a few other guns within a few hours of gameplay, and have also accrued a few loaned guns which expire after a few days of redeeming them (you can store them in your inbox for days before redeeming), but i might not even use them as guns are obtained very reasonably. netcode is absolutely incredible and i haven't ever felt like i should have got that hit/kill unless it was down to my own failures, absolutely top marks in that regard.my one huge gripe with this game, however, is down to the community. people never ever communicate but on the off chance they do it's probably to call someone the n word (although i haven't played the hostage/snd game modes too much). unfortunately i'm not exaggerating at all, in my hours of gameplay so far, not a single player has taken my advice from enemy locations or objective instructions. players mostly use knives on objectives so they are absolutely sitting ducks ripe for the picking, but no one will ever go and get that easy kill if you tell them there is an enemy knifing an objective. ever.i have not seen a single positive thing come from the community except the occasional gl hf which is usually followed by a go f_ your mom n_ f_ or something along those lines. you need to play with friends if you want any chance of your teammates being responsive, especially as this game is full of fp noobs.that being said, if you have a good group of friends to play with, you'll probably stomp every single game and never actually lose.amazing game, let down slightly by an atrocious community. if you're american it might not be so bad as it may just be the language barrier of european servers as well as the type of people that play fp games here.",1

10111,"love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. i would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. it is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. with that being said, i'll continue with why i love the game.it is an excellent pay to play game and literally the only online game i have subscribed to aside from world of warcraft when i was younger. me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. this helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. this get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. i've taken doiwn or animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.i also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency em$. aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. you can also earn em$ by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an e-mail. i've earned well ove , em$ through this process and although i have spent real money on the game, if i really wanted to, i could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment i wanted.finally i'll talk about the dev team. with regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. new areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and i can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games i've ever played and although i hope they change their pricing model some day, i'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.edit: also i should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). the first month will cost you $. a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. if you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (gm$) than you could pay for a month membership for $. a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours i have in the game so i'll explain why i have so many. if you leave the initial thehunter browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. i leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so i can get the latest news they have updated the game with. so if you think it's sketchy that i have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because i leave the main browser open.",1

(the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of seconds!) beyond the combat: bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. you kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. so, bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. also, as i'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. people in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different mmo in a language you don't understand. gear: initially (for the first levels, as far as i was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) easily the worst mmo i've ever played. most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.",0
9198,"for a fp fps mmo game, planetside hits the nail right on the head. it is essentially tf except on a massive scale (when i say massive i mean massive. think of a map as big as a free roam rpg.) with vehicles, more players and endless fun. i never played the original, but this would probably be better. it is also a first person shooter.it is a hard thing to review planetside . there is just so much content. we'll star with the good:the good:the map size is massive! a whole continent. and not just one continent. three! with another one releasin in april . every inch of the map is accessible if you have the right equipment. from the sweeping planes, mountains and desert of indar, to the barren and snow swept continent of esamir, with its huge craggy purple things and plains of snow, to the lush forest of amerish, with its trees, grass and mountains. there are three different factions to choose from: the glorious terran republic (my personal favourite), the xeno-tech worshiping turds of the vanu soverignty, the rebels dogs of the new conglomerate. if you want more about each of the factions, here is a link: there are five classes to chose from in planetside : the infiltrator who handles sniping and sneaking. the light assault who flies around the battlefield with his jetpack. the heavy assault who just shoots stuff with a huge amount of ammo and has heavy armour. the combat medic. he (or she doesn't matter) heals allies and shoots stuff if they get in his way. the engineer who repairs vehicles, sports the same weapons of the light assault. there is one last thing i have to mention on the classes: the max! this is just a smaller mech. he has two mounted weapons, huge amounts of health and a high kill rate. engineers heal him and medics revive him.the amount of players. you need lots of people to fill up a large map right? well here we have hunrdreds of players per side! and if you are lucky enough you may get a three-way battle.finally, the vehicles. you can use vehicles like the flash and the harrasser to get around the map fast. things like tanks steam-roll anyone who gets in their way. planes can get you around, destroyand be mobile spawn sites. sunderes on the gorund can also be a moblie spawn site.the bad: the lag. do not play if you do not have a good internet connection!!! there is so much lag if you dont have a good connection speed. it makes the game a horror to play.sometimes other player are real dip. they team kill you, run you over and scream and swear a lot! there are also a huge amount of micro-transactions. like for weapons (you can buy them with ingame money as well, but it takes for ever to get a good one). they are also for vehicles and aircraft. but this is not that bad as you can buy the station cash (micro-transaction money) with steam credit.also, there is a glitch that i experience when if i log off to play another game and i come back later, i can't log on! not sure if i'm the only one though... but if anyone else experiences it, please tell me!rant ended.conclusion:all in all this game is awesome and you should really get it. there really is no reason not to since it is free. out of ten!",1

10913,"edit: one minor gripe. as you keep playing, even once you max out gauntlet and forge, the enemies keep getting harder. this normally would be an okay thing, but it eventually becomes impossible. while the game is very rewarding, it doesn't reward you enough to keep up with the increasing difficulty, and increasing legendary cards your ai opponents will play on you. eventually you're reduced to playing gauntlets and hoping for them to get crap hands the entire match, or else risk being reduced to getting wooden chests for your efforts. this really forces you into a wall. and even buying packs won't help, because they seldom ever give you any cards that boost your ability. a legendary drop from a card pack is an extremely rare thing. this makes it feel like you're reduced to waiting for seasons to reset, so you can start beating opponents for rewards again. been playing it on mobile more than steam. so my time is low on here. i highly recommend to mtg and hearthstone fans that are looking for something a bit more rewarding. this game really doesn't reach for your wallet at all. and it's very friendly towards people that just want to play solo against ai. it doesn't force you to play other people to earn currency/packs like hearthstone does. i do wish you could clear out the daily quests from the forced mutliplayer stuff, however. the mechanics are closer to mtg than hearthstone. but the attributes of cards (charge, deadly, etc) follow more closely to hearthstone than mtg.it has a good sized campaign, which mostly sits as your tutorial. there's a gauntlet mode, reminscent of hs's arena mode, though you'll pick your deck before hand. there's a forge mode that's exactly like arena from hs, picking between cards up until your deck is finished, then battling a series of opponents. i've really only checked the solo side of things. i know mp has ranked and casual, and a draft. i've heard rumblings that some decks are unbalanced in mp (aggro decks that kill before you can even get your mana up). but i can't really speak on that. i guess i can see where you can make some insane op decks. but that's kind of the fun part. i've been doing the same, and ranking up in gauntlet. this game throws free packs, and currency at you like i've never seen in a ftp game before. it's very generous. you will get plenty of cards for your collection if you play regularly.edit: still really enjoying this game a few days later. which is unusual for me. i usually binge on a game, and then am done with it after a few days. this game is just so rewarding. i'm playing gauntlets, forges, and drafts, and the game just throws gold, crafting shards, and packs at you like crazy. the satisfaction of building a successful deck, and trying new strategies really keeps this game going for me. comparing decks on websites like eternalwarcry, and planning my next deck is a big plus too. again, i really have a high recommendation for this game.update - july ,: one minor gripe. when the game absolutely wants you to lose, you're going to lose. you'll either draw no mana, or all mana and no minions/powers. or the opposing ai will topdeck a perfect game on you. it just happens sometimes. so be prepared for that. i really wish they'd adjust the ai/rng for that. it's painfully obvious when you're getting blocked from a win on a forge/gauntlet or otherwise ai match. you can tell when there's a fair exchange after playing a few weeks. and then you can tell when the game just absolutely doesn't want you to win.",1

5660,"as a hardcore flight combat simulation, dcs can't be beat by anything else out there. so much has already been said about the flight modeling, the graphics, the maps and effects, and the modules already - but the beauty of the system is that you can get as simple or as complex as you want, and you can mix and match modules to suit your needs. want to simulate wwii and the normandy invasions? there modules for that. want to simulate flying korean war situations? there's modules for that (except for a korea map). want to simulate gulf war situations? there's modules for that. fly planes off airfields or aircraft carriers, strafe or drop bombs on static or mobile targets, engage in air to air with guns or missiles. or simply fly around and check out the scenery.in my case, i set out to simulate my experiences with jane's f/a-e (from way, way back). so i purchased the persian gulf map and the f/a-c package (which is so, so much more advanced than the jane's model was almost years ago now). the price tag of the modules was a bit intimidating, yes - but after flying the f/a-c for as much as i have it was worth every penny. i picked up the a-c as well, and it's just as fun.i also fly exclusively in vr. the only issue with that is spotting - there are aids to assist with spotting planes which does help immensely. but there's no substitute really... flying the f/a-c off the carrier, flying a mission, and returning to land on the carrier is amazing in vr.if you are a flight combat sim enthusiast, and like to fly modern jets, there really is no other platform out there that compares. there are, however, some important things that you need to keep in mind: there is a steep learning curve, particularly with the more detailed modules (f/a-c, a-c, f-, blackhawk, etc.). this is not a simulation where you can simply hop in a plane / chopper, fire it up, and fly loops around others. it takes time, effort, and lots of training and learning systems to fly these well - but it's extremely rewarding once you've put in the time. dcs world is a graphically intensive game, and has a lot of background stuff going on (particularly the campaign missions) that requires a good video card and a beefy cpu. you will need a decent gaming rig to get good frame rates - particularly so if you plan on trying it with vr. you cannot fly this simulation with a controller. just... don't. if you're serious about this, get a hotas. ch pro, thrustmaster warthog, etc. some of the newer modules are still works in progress, like the f/a-c. updates are frequent however, and new systems are being added all the time until the module(s) is completed (currently this applies to the f/a- and the f-). dcs has a huge online community, and offers many, many groups or squadrons to fly with that offer just about any situation you want to experience, be it pvp, co-op, co-op campaigns, or a mixture of all of it. dcs is moddable, and has a huge amount of mods available that enhance the graphics, or missions, or environment, or just about anything else. the built-in mission editor is fairly simple to use - but it is extremely robust and has advanced capabilities that allow for very detailed and complex setups that can create extremely detailed missions and campaigns. some of the modules (like the l- albatross and the f- tomcat) allow for players to simultaneously fly in the same aircraft - either for training or radar systems and weapon usage. as cool as this is, it's even cooler in vr. some of the modules are pricey, considering other flight simulation packages. however, the game does come with the caucasus map free, and you can purchase less complex aircraft modules (like the f- or the mig-) if the more complex and pricey modules don't appeal to you.if any of this appeals to you, download dcs today and give it a try. the base package is free and comes with the su- frogfoot (a ground attack aircraft), the p-, and the caucasus map. that will give you a taste of the dcs world package and what you can expect from it. additionally, there are a ton of videos on youtube that answer just about any question you might have about the sim, a given airplane, or most everything else.get it. fly. have a blast.",1

9190,"after about hours of gameplay i have learned a few tricks and tips that might help you out as a beginner. first of all, get the hang of the map, try to figure out where the enemies are and what general direction they're moving and where they want to move, and where you and your team want to move, to see chokepoints and be able to ambush them. all this information can be seen on the map. second, i recommend you to get comfy with one or two weapons at first, you will notice there are bunch of different weapons and weapon types but really, it all comes down to what you feel comfortable using, and what the situation is. dont spend cert points on new weapons at first, buy a scope for the weapon you're using, maybe some extra nades, or upgrade your special ability. i recommend spending certs on all-around items like health packs, nanoweave armor, stuff that can be used on mutiple classes, even vehicles that you use often. third, vehicles, they can be a great advantage if used in the right place at the right time, if you're playing with friends, a big ship with alot of turrets is the way to go, this might take some time to get used to where to fly, what altitude is the best and how to maneuver the ship but, it will net you the most kills before you go down.hope this helps out, and remember, live free in the nc!!",1

14655,"this was a great game until the loot system was introduced...why? for one, they took away the level lock system which made everything fair, now some level one can get an incredibly over powered weapon but still be matched with bots around his cpu.secondly, there is no more economy to this game, the idea was completely scraped. the economy made it fun because i could buy whatever part i needed to make my dream bot come to life, now it's hoping i will get a decent part that i can actually use on my bot.thirdly, the premium system doesn't work well with this update, there's not much there to pull you into buying it, i either miss extra parts from ba or one extra part from deathmatch.these are just my opinions, but they truly did ruin a great game and a lot of my friends have stopped playing.update:i know alot of popular games like lol and such are adding crates or similar mechanics to the game but if you've actually noticed, they haven't thrown their whole economy done the drain, the crate mechanic is a seperate feature that player can do if they desire to.also it wouldn't be that hard to bring back that good old leveling scheme and still having a crate mechanic, all you would have to do is literally just limit what the lower levels can get, it really isn't that hard to do. i'm really just sick and tired of seeing low levels being able to two-shot eachother, it takes away all the fun.",0

7921,"i really like this game. i almost didn't bother with it after seeing such bad reviews. i realize that this is a free to play mmorpg. something a company thought of to give the public something to do with their time. these reviews sadden me because i feel like the people who wrote them were being truly ungrateful. some things you do need to buy but they give a lot of different items so you don't have to pay. you get a horse for crying out loud for gold and a variety of companions for . some games that's completely impossible. you can get astral diamonds from the online gateway and you get nearly , a day for repeatable quest, plus you can sell any rare items to accumulate more astral. you can even get rare pets from events pretty easily. i recently got a flame sprite, and it's awesome, if you don't have ,+ in a month then it's probably not the games fault. it's probably yours because everyone has a life but the game gives you what you need to be successful. i haven't gotten to the higher levels yet but so far i've leveled up very easily with no problems. runestones are dropped left and right from any dungeon. i love the dungeons, i love how it's practically got a video game type interface. don't let the reviews make you turn away from this game. check it out yourself. if you like it fine, if you don't, that's fine too, but don't leave a nasty review making other people turn away because you can't get something you might want. i recently got a ds and i am thankful. i am not going to complain about how i have very limited games or about the color. going to be grateful the damn thing was free. not all games are for everyone but that doesn't mean it deserves such negativity that half of these reviews displayed.",1

17299,"i was very thrilled to play this game after watching the films and series, but this game is very disappointing, most of the new dragons that have been introduced in the series, are only for members only. they say that nothing is for free these days yet when i used to play games nothing was that hard to get, but these days its cash, its very disapointing, but let me shed some light on this game before i get to the huge down fall, this game is going to be mostly recommneded to the fans of the 'how to train your dragon' this games style and design looks a lot like the style of the series that is currently on netflix, the characters of the main cast are in it and help you along the way, you even get to meet their dragons as well.the area of the game changes to the current season which is nice and you can recognize a lot of the areas. you get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form, very cute and you get to choose the colours, but you can't fly for a very long time. reminded me of istaria the animation mechanics are ok a little buggy but not bad now here are the down fallssometimes when exiting the area, the loading screen will come up, it will nag you to get a membership, it will take a while to get to the next area, once it does, it will appear again before you can move on and do your quests or tasks around the area, sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash.i struggled to get out of this on wide screen, so if any of you have a pc that struggles to run these types of games, please keep it on window just incase it decides to crash on you.after the crash i decided to check the reviews, sadly all the negatives were right you take a few steps and it already crashes on you, exit an area to another it will crash, go fishing, it will lag so much as well as when you chop down trees for wood, it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc.another reason to keep it on window.unfortunatly i had to get rid of the game due to the graphics and lagging on the game, it crashed times.loading it back up is more quicker than getting around the areas.don't play this game if you dont want your pc to suffer from crashes and freezesplay this game on window just to be safebut overall i highly recommended you to not play this game, its needs much more work because it still looks like its in testing, it looks very much like the old graphics from a very old console, lets say ps sort of style, yes i know that sounds very harsh but its true. it also needs more free stuff than just membership stuff. the lag makes it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere. i am very disappointed in this game, but if your little ones would like to play it, make sure your pc can run alright on it, and keep it on window just be on the safe side, but don't be surprised if it crashes on window screens as well.",0

9579,"okay, were to begin, this game has just been sold to a new complany, so if you play or are thinking of playing know it will be under further development. this game is an mmo, there is no pvp only a realm (- in each server) with a maximum of people all fighting events, bosses, minibosses, gods and minions to level up, better their gear and of course complete all the objective to verse oryx the mad god. the game is a perma death, meaning if you die, you die, and no matter how many hours you have on that character, its dead make a new one. so when you die it can be quite stressful, panic-related shock and anger causing. having oover + hours on the game it safe to say i have died alot, quit alot and restarted alot. the idea of the game is to get loot from bosses, better the teir of your items or get unteired items from certain bosses that are really good. now the game itself is quite repetetive, so if you see everything once or twice, if you keep playing you'll ebd up seeing it thousands of times (thats not a joke). taking into consideration the game will be soon under development, expect new things monthly even weekly. i rate this game / with friends (very fun and addicting) and / without (very boring). so if you're looking to play/invest money into this game as it is very 'pay to win', make sure you have friends to do it with you. final thoughts of this game or rating is /, highly enjoyable for the most part, would spend the + hours again.",1

14440,"do not get this game. wow!it has only gotten worse and worse. back in everything was fantastic! we had a cool tech tree that inspired all players to keep playing, building, battling, and creating. there use to be a bunch of good game mechanics and the play was addicting and would keep you satisfied foralmost every battle. since then, a lot has changed. everyone was excited when we heard we would get new weapons and better parts, but there were some changes to how much rp (robo points) you could get from winning. the changes kept coming, with each update going one step forward and three steps back. back in the good days, there were various tiers of blocks, with the higher tier blocks having more health than the previous tier. those had good things and bad things, but for the most part they were good. (each tier of block would be a different color, essentially meaning the paint that we have now was all free and you didn't have to buy premium to get cool colors.) the update back in the winter of changed a lot. with the various block tiers gone, the millions of rp that i had spent on strong&healthy blocks had all gone to wast, with no refund! i could also get into the ranking system. it used to be great, allowing for higher tier items to go into lower tiers, wich allowed for more fun. even though it may sound unfair it would not be an effective strategy for actuall combat. this system worked well and rank was built around each weapon having a different robo score. but as with all good things in robocraft, that was removed. and instead, it was replaced by a system that still had tiers, but wasn't as fun. adding restrictions to a creative game is just something that doesn't ever work out too well. eventually the tier system was abolished and replaced with a system that puts you in a match with robots that have a similar overall robot level. that was nothing compared to what it has turned into now. now, the tech tree idea has been trashed and instead replaced by a rarety system with crates. this new update completely killed robocraft. (as if the other updates hadn't done enough damage already) the game is no longer based around skill or experience, it is pure luck. you used to be able to get new items by buying them off the shop with the rp you had earned by battling, (the better you did the more you earned) but now, the only way you will be able to get your hands on that nice plasma cannon is by opening a crate and praying that you get it. and as others have said, the current game, as it stands, is purely luck based.well freejam ill give it to you, you sure do know how to ruine a great game!tl;drthe game now suckspoint system has gone tobr>no longer an insentive to playall luck, no skilldon't waste your time on this gameused to be fantastic game butdevs killed it this just shows how much the devs don't care. fact!all the cool building they are doing in the trailer/video are with the old version, when it didn't suck as bad!",0

2368,"i've spent hours upon hours playing diablo . i love that game too. this game is pretty awesome in it's own right, but while they come from a similar mold, the two games are as different as night and day. i think both are good, personally, but what makes this game really amazing, is the outstanding value. this game gives everything you would expect from a triple a developer. literally. just gives it to you. nothing that is sold in the stores is in any way going to help you win the game, unlock content that is needed, or give you a special edge in the game. it's a full on retail value game, literally, for free. play it all you like. make up to characters. have a huge shared stash by default. i'm going to end up supporting this game eventually when i get the money. not because i have to, but because i want to. this game makes you want to pay for it, because it's freaking awesome. if this hasn't gotten you interested, i don't know what else will, but if you're a fan of diablo, torchlight, or the genre in general, you should give this a whirl without a doubt.",1

6664,"played it on beta, it was so good. after this i was starting to get bored. servers were crashing more frequently, and they started the extra packs so they would promote them a lot. plus the squad system destroyed what was left from the game.",0
11447,"this game is pretty fun. i like to play it when i need to vent off from other games. the mechanics are well made and if you play others fps games you will easily carry your skills over. it looks like a cod game while it feels like your playing csgo a nice mixture of both if you ask me. this game is free to play so there are some micro transactions within the game. but i would say it's not that bad. but this game isn't all awesome, it has some flaws like any other game. there are two things i feel like i have to adress in the game. first the loot boxes. / boxes you're gonna open are gonna contain either nates for a couple of days or you get a skin for a day. so it really feels like nothing. to get these skins permanent you have to buy ingame currency and buy loot boxes. and you're gonna get smoke and grenates lasting for a year before you get the skin you want. second the matchmaking is one of the worst i've seen in any game. i play with - friends when im playing black squad and we always either play against people that have several hundreds of hours more than us, or players that literally tries the game for the first time.conclusion: i think it's a fun game when i need to vent from other games, but not a game i can sit and play for hours. definetely worth trying out atleast.tip: there are x free weapon dlc's that you can download that let's you try all (or most of them) weapons for days. so you have two weeks to find a weapon you prefer and then you can spend your free k on your favourite weapon when it's time is up.",1
11100,"enjoy this game a lot, the defense and faction mechanics set it apart from other ccgs. however i never recieved packs that were promised as part of a promotion that was actually the reason i bought in-game currency so until this issue is solved i will be leaving this review negative and advising against buying this game.issue solved, very responsive support. now onto an actual review of the game. first i'll start with the cons. i don't believe that eternal is the best or the most unique ccg ever. for me that honour would have to go to chronicle: runescape legends (r.i.p). i also disagree with what some others have said that this is the fairest ccg out there for fp players. due to the sheer amount of deck faction combinations and the lack of any sort of cap on legendaries used in decks, there are a lot of high-cost legendary cards and the best decks contain a lot of them. you only have to do a quick search for eternal decks to see that many recommended decks contain upwards of legendaries. you do earn coins very fast but not particularly faster than other ccgs. you are however given many more packs and single cards as rewards, and as far as i can tell the legendary drop rate is higher than most. however, i don't believe this entirely makes up for the card volume and cost to the point where you could call it the fairest on the market.on to the pros. while i said it is not the best or most unique ever, i certainly believe it is the best and most unique ccg out right now. the mechanisms force you to actually use your head. logic and math come into it more than most, if not all other games of this nature and you will find yourself in chesslike scenarios fairly often and will lose because of poor strategy rather than bad luck, such is the case with too many other digital card games.there is so much to do in this game, so many replayable game modes, including a vast singleplayer experience, something many will be grateful for. and the singleplayer campaigns are purchaseable with the relatively easily earned non-premium currency! as well as this you can keep all the cards you handpick in the forge and draft modes and, while the price of playing these modes is a little steep, you don't have to even play too well to earn at least half of it back. also, free cards.all-in-all, i would say this is worth your time if you've played similar games but are after something with a little more depth.",1
3635,"team fortress is a first-person shooter game from valve.the gameplay is somewhat similar to counter-strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike counter-strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. the game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. you can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. and the best thing about his game is hats! yes, hats. most every damn people here on steam loves them. you can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! many people make profit from it, many people collect it.team fortress graphics is d but with cartoon style. even though the graphics is cartoon, team fortress still feature blood and gore effects. all effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized.this is great free to play game for me, i highly recommend it. play it now!rating /",1
19410,"> you clearly don't knowno, i do, i've been here since alpha and admined multiple servers, made plenty of machines and farms of all sorts. you might fool your mom with hey look i found this cool bug and designed this whole machine around it?! imsosmart! oh wow honey yes you are! but people in the game are all painfully aware that the ratio of folk who discover groundbreaking new exploits and farms to those who look up exact step by step instructions online with zero effort or creativity is like :,, lol.but that's all beside the point anyway. cheating is never justified or not by whether it was hard to cheat... it's still wrong to cheat whether hard or easy.single player, every playstyle is valid, and mojang creates a lot of content for crazy shenanigans there.multi player, the game needs tlo be fair per server. getting an edge over all your fellow players by abusing glitches is straight and simple cheating. no two ways about it, no different than swiping money from your brother's pile in monopoly while he goes to the bathroom. unless your server admins explicitly condone this. but if they did why wouldn't they have just made it a creative server? so very likely... they don't.",0

5931,"i'll start with requirements. forget requirements in description, those are for old client. right now you need high-end gaming equipment to play this game smooth and nice or you'll need to run in potato mode. somebody mentioned it earlier - multiplayer is laggy. worst part is when you're in the middle of opperation or just taking off from airport and somebody connects to server. allready dozen times happened that crash happened because so much lags. i don't mind ai, it's pretty decent. if you want to learn and practice use lower setting, if you're up to more challenge make the ai level higher and if you're hardcore just join some pvp multiplayer. the simulation level is marvellous. you can actually fly modern military aircraft which is mostly impossible to ever fly for most people on the earth. lack of finish on most recently released models can be frustrating but it's a better learning curve for newbies (you don't have whole plane to learn but in part by part). i'm not really into helicopters and ww or cold war period planes but for modern i must say they are awesome. get a decent hotas, grab at least gtx (but i recommend ), vr headset and get ready for some amazing experience.",1

8386,"personal score: out of neverwinter, set in the dungeons and dragons universe, is one of my few favorite mmos. most of the quests are not the typical kill rats and come back and see me type, sometimes you have to actually accomplish killing a boss as if you were a bounty hunter. secondly the keys you use in combat differ from most mmos out there, which makes you feel like you're drawn into the battles more. instead of using thru as your hotkeys, it's done through the q, e, and r keys, and serve as special attacks, while ,, and allow you to add potions or whatnots on them. controls your mount and tab allows you to access a special ability. while combat is straight-forward, you can didge attacks in this game, unlike most mmos where you keep clicking until you or your enemy is dead. the graphics seem a bit dated for being an mmo only opened a few years ago, and sometimes you may run into lag if there are too many users on the one and only server they have, but that's okay as far as i'm concerned, these are minor annoyances for me that can be easily overlooked. the other great feature is the foundry. the foundry is accessible after you reach level (?) with your in-game character, and it allows you to actually design quests for others to play in-game. so if you're a d&d lover, you can use that love to create quests others can enjoy. the only real downside is that this is a free mmo. this means they make their money through the item shop where you spend real cash for in-game items not found anywhere else. this may be terrible to some, but you can get through the game without using it. you just may not be able to craft a certain enchantment for your weapon or have the flashiest mount to ride on, or open enchantment boxes, but that's okay, because there is lots of stuff to do and see. grab a sword, cast a spell, and enjoy neverwinter... an mmo i highly recommend.",1

6447,"english/german reviewenglish:the m/m-carbine is totally unbalanced and gives the us-faction a tremendous advantage.this weapon can be modified towards an extremely high rate of fire with nearly no recoil through weapon modifications.thus it shoots faster and is more stable than all machine pistols and thus much more useful in close quarter combat.in addition to this overpowered status of the weapon itself, it has a very high number of reserve magazines at its disposal.the two other factions have no comparable weapons in their arsenals.a post in the forums, to point this unbalance to reto (the devs) out, got closed without any comment ( ) .that is a bad service and thus i can't recommend the game at this time.german: die existenz der total aus der balance geratenen m/m carbine gibt der us-fraktion einen ungeheuren vorteil.diese waffe kann mittels waffenmodifikationen auf eine extrem hohe feuerrate mit so gut wie keinem rcksto modifiziert werden. sie ist damit sogar schneller, stabiler und im kampf auf kurze distanz brauchbarer als alle maschinenpistolen.verbunden mit dem absolut hohen munitionsvorrat ist diese waffe total aus der balance, die beiden anderen fraktionen haben keine hnlichen, starken waffen.ein forenpost, der reto (die entwickler) auf diesen missstand hinwies und der eine korrektur anmahnte ( ) wurde kommentarlos geschlossen.das ist schlicht ein schlechter service, daher kann ich das spiel zur zeit nicht positiv bewerten.garman-update:english:they still didn't nerf the carbine.they reworked the maps, they're definitely better now.but the new spawnsystem made tactical gameplay completely impossible, more details here: in all, the game became even less fun to play, so i still can't recommend the game.deutsch:der m/m-karabiner wurde immernoch nicht generft.die maps wurden berarbeitet und sind jetzt deutlich besser.allerdings hat das neue spawnsystem ein taktisches spielen, insbesondere flankieren, unmglich gemacht, mehr details hier: in allem macht es jetzt sogar noch weniger spa, das spiel zu spielen, ich kann es daher leider immernoch nicht empfehlen.",0

9034,"edit ---i am editing my review as i have put another + hours into the game since the original review was posted. i think i can explain the game additionally now seeing every side of the game.over those hours i realized the game doesn't change mainly because of the community.the community, what's left from it is all veteran players that have been used to the system for so long. no changes will be made to the game as its community is slowly but surely dying. on peek times around players a day, not a good sign, to top that soe just announced merging of us servers because of low population.as a new player: the game is extremely harsh for new players, not only are you put in a significant disadvantage from the start with crappy weapons, you are thrown into the game without a single idea of where, who or what you are doing or suppose to be doing, against all max ranked players that dedicated their lives to farming you.on top of that, anyone trying to get into the vehicleside side of gameplay is pretty much sure to fail. as all players are on the same map at the same time, your stock vehicle will get melted in nanoseconds, your only choice is to get stomped for probably hundreds of hours until you get it good enough so you can stomp infantry and vehicles alike.oh but wait! you can always put your credit card out so you can buy better infantry weapons, only bucks each! and they don't transfer over your other characters..this section will be for the thoughts of the community, i have spent a lot of time trying to get into the mind of these vet players and even though this is not the thought of every player, it is of the majority.general thoughts of vets: infantry is scum, almost being npcs in a true mmorpg. those npcs are for farming certs (currency which is used for buying all weapons and upgrades), the only true skill in their mind are massive vehicle battles, (one hand on the mouse, point and click and the other is for you can only guess what), the order is like this, infantry is the worst (almost everyone agrees on that) < tanks < aircrafts. whole game could be compared to an mmo where your character is in a vehicle and farms infantry - npcs. good thing this game is an fps mmo, because that's a complete lie. being a foot soldier in this game is considered primitive and everyone who enjoys the fps aspect is an ape in the eyes of the community, naturally soe gives in to their requests and with every patch either messes up that fragile balance or completely throws stuff out the window. for them it is completely fine for infantry to get one shot by almost every vehicle weapon, but vehicles are almost godlike, in firepower and survivability. only thing in question is which vehicle will be the most powerful one.anyone trying to even suggest a change on the forums is only met with responses similar to go play cod kid.only thing i got wrong in my original review is the rebalancing part. the whole game requires complete revamp of major game mechanics and design choices, something that will never happen.don't even try this game, i can't recommend it simply as the community is dying and what's left of it is under illusion vehicleside is how it's suppose to be. my old review is still correct and gives good examples of the balance in this game, luckily i can put this game to rest once and for all on my part.original review ---hello everyone,when i first saw this game i was looking for a casual fps that could satisfy my need for killing. sure enough, this game did the job, hundreds of people on the same map, maybe even thousands, who knows.the game cannot be compared to battlefield or call of duty, features unique playing styles with a lot of diversity in weapons and classes.good sides, massive online fighting pretty much all day long, major maps on which you fight, each one with around other sub maps for you to capture or defend, open world shoot out, terrain limitation is almost none, you can create your own pathing for the best position and ambushes. great weapon arsenal, a ton of guns from smg's, assault rifles, snipers, you name it. the guns mostly perform differently and look differently, factions for you play with and they are all unique.crazy battle moments with vehicles like tanks, light vehicles, air units, the whole idea is to feel a part of something greater than a common soldier and this game nailed it, the feeling when you fight vs is epic, even though you might be playing alone. probably best of all, you get all these good things free.sadly, like every game, this one has downsides, flaws that destroyed the game for me.the game with all of the air and ground units has serious balancing issues. massive battles mostly turn into a camp fest when one side brings in around - tanks to one base. camping the spawn point of the other side, pretty much destroying not only their defence but the whole experience of the game.infantry is unbalanced as well, out of the daily best players, all play heavy assault or light troops, pretty much classes are chosen all the time because of the weapons and their survivability, not very interesting for the other weaker classes.others have decent utility but when it comes down to who can tank more shots, which you might think is important in a vs game...those are pretty much the only choice. air offensive is just as bad, like tanks, they pretty much have unlimited ammo, spamming the whole artilery on just one guy that actually made it meters from the spawn. all vehicles beside one or two are very hard to destroy, taking around - anti-tank missiles, after which they simply hide behind a rock or something to be repaired within - seconds and the process repeats itself, considering player only needs to press deploy on a console and instantly has a tank or aircraft to drive, not a fun experience at all.what to say about balance when an aircraft, liberator dives in, sits, yes, lands on tanks and destroys them instantly without taking almost any damage, also most vehicles don't take damage from anything than rockets or flak cannons, found on other vehicles mostly...game also has some bugs that makes some players invincible, hackers, almost none, i don't really know, might be a few, but it's a free to play so i don't mind. also the game randomly crashes several times a day, even has errors with nvidia graphic cards that makes the card turn off for some time in the game only, causing you to lose the screen for some time.the game in general is good for anyone who just wants to shoot something every now and then. it has problems like every other game does, but these i can't just ignore. it has potential but requires balancing.",0

9423,so i played this game for a long while. what deca (yes i'm looking at you /u/silx) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. but you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. keep it up :)to any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.,1

6249,"i played this game a lot when it first came out and i loved it, i loved being a commander sending in troops to help with the war, i loved sniping, flanking, finding different routes to the objective and adjusting my guns through the money gained each match. years on i went back to the game... i wish i hadn't. the commander mode i enjoyed was now gated under high ranks i would never achieve (i liked to log in play an hour or two as commander and then go do something else) so now i won't be able to help in the war effort by sending troops in. the progression has been slowed right down to where you need the premium (which you pay for) to get anywhere and even then it's still slow going.the game itself seems to have gone backwards in gameplay and the menu system is... awful. good luck finding anything quickly if your new or coming back to the game after a long period away. limited squads means you can only team with other friends, a very bigif you're wanting to play with or more friends because guess what... you cant! unless you rank up a lot to (we think) increase the number of people in the squad. bad, bad system.personally having gone back a year, maybe two later i won't be playing this game again. it's sad, because i used to love this game but from what i've read and heard the devs dont seem to give aabout what their consumers say/want which is never a good thing really. current rating of this game: /(there is some fun to be had in this game still, but like most of the upgrades it's gated behind hours and hours of frustration. in my view, not worth it.)",0
14415,"i use to like this game, but not anymore. they redid all the weapons based off of one weapon, and in my opinion, ruined all that was good about them. skill doesn't seem to matter anymore as anyone can kill you with a few hits. since any bot can have all the weapons on it at a time, it has become who fire the first shot instead of trying to outsmart your enemy with distance and weapon type. teamwork doesn't seem to matter anymore either. thats probably the main thing i dislike. my friends and i all agree that lack of team work has made it less fun. use to, you would have to work with ur teammates to win a match. now any bot can kill all enemies. it just who fires the first shot.",0

10841,"i started playing magic the gathering back in middle school and continued through highschool. unfortunately once i graduated and my group of friends moved on, i gave up the game. our group was never competative (i'm sure most of us never realized that magic tournaments existed), we just played the game to have fun.i learned that magic online was a thing that existed shortly after it released, but learning of the pricing scheme there was no way i was going to get involved with it (and this is coming from someone that was willing to pay a monthly subscription to mmo's). it just seemed rediculous to me to pay for digital cards...when they weren't actually collectables in my mind. pc gaming was always my main hobby even during my magic years, and quite frankly there are tons of pc games better than what magic offers.fast forward to today and eternal.the game has everything that magic should offer to a player. it has an excellent deck building system that lets you quickly and easily sort your collection even as new cards are added. it has a variety of game modes, including both competative and non-competative options which is very important for me as i need to be in the right mood to want to play vs. another player. it has great characters and an interesting setting that stands out from other games. but the most important thing eternal has is fun.the game is fun.i really appreciate how the developer (dwd) has taken the time to realize that they aren't creating just a card game. they are making a computer game. they have taken the solid foundation that magic has built and turned that into a game that is actually modernized for play in the internet era.each game takes ~-minutes usually and with how they have structured their game modes and rewards, you still feel like you are making progress towards earning new cards even if that one game is all you have time for. if you are playing one of the modes versus an ai opponent, you can even leave mid-game and come back later if required.the most recent (aug ) feature added was an excellent puzzle mode, which to me harkens back to scrye or inquest what's the play puzzles. even though i have been playing the game for about a year i was surprised how many tips for new players they were able to add into the puzzle mode to give you a little bit of a strategic level up after coming out of the tutorial. i am so happy i found this game and honestly very excited for its future. an account long-term progression mode is coming soon and i am interested to see what that offers.",1

16459,"needs some improvements to really be a high rated game. whats good: taking apart and reassembling. its not perfect. the controls are really wonky, and instructions aren't totally clear. it's not always completely flexible either. but still. this part of the game is a lot of fun. and, as a gun owner, it was fun to take apart the same gun i own in a game, and see its interpretation of such. what needs improvement: the shooting range. it's god awful. they could really borrow from arma or aa for some more realisic shooting. this feels like a cheesy arcade shooter, and the recoil and ballistics are way off. i realize that maybe its not to be taken seriously, but this game is going to invite gun nuts like myself to play. and when we go to the range portion.. its going to let us down. i have to reaffirm these points because the game also presumes to reach for your wallet at every turn. want that next gun? buy it with real money, or grind exp for eternity. want that other range? yep. pay up.. or grind. its okay to ding around in with the free version for a bit, but otherwise... its not worth a long time play. and if they want that much money, they need that many improvements.",0

15095,a year and a half ago and i would of thoroughly recommended this game. but after recent updates my opinions towards this game have changed drastically. with an almost entirely new combat system now allowing bots to have more than one weapon type which completely breaks the nature of the game. i like the idea of free loot etc after a game to ease the process of getting items for your bot however the removal of the tech tree with the tier stars was a bump downhill and really where my dislike for the game happened. i could go on for much longer but i fear i would bore those of you reading this review so i will put it nice and clear at the end here for you.don't play the game they turned it into a load of,0

10214,"once you get over the fact that this game is not in spirit a, free to play, it is one of the best hunting simulators in current day. you have to buy a basic membership if you plan on enjoying this game. so you have all licenses & ammunition without either expiring. in hindsight, the membership is actually cheaper then your average mmorpg, which charges you at average $ a month. thehunter only asks for $ for the entire year. or if you want extra stuff to work with, $ for the trailrunner, and you can keep everything in the package even after it expires.the animals do not interact with each other realistically like in deer hunter season , but even with that, the game is still extremely enjoyable especially in its multiplayer. making new friends in this game is very easy and motivates you to hunt newer species, explore more of the reserves, and try out different ways of hunting.also, this is not a run & gun arena shooter game like call of duty. so if you have the patience span of a gnats d*ck, you'll hate this game.so understand specifically that this is not a total free game. but the asking price is not terrible either especially with the content that can be explored. buying things in the game is optional. some things you do need but can buy in packs.duck hunting you do need the callers or you cannot hunt ducks. camoflauge plays a big deal in it too. so if you plan on spending money in spots for different hunting, then plan out where you'll spend it without going broke. manage your cash, is all i can tell you.so, give thehunter a chance. or if you're too broke then you will not be able to enjoy this game.",1

14433,"robocraft is a really cool idea, build a vehicle from bits and battle it out. feels like playing with lego and pretending to have battles.. but for real. pretty great.but much of the fun is having pieces to play with, and being able to stick a whole bunch of em together. i do hope the devs read this, i know its one amongst the storm though.they have consistantly tried to monetize in some way, but i think have fallen short. unfortunately the easiest way is to put pieces behind some sort of pay wall, experience, credits, tech tree, whatever. as well as have some sort slow progression like we see with the cpu here.i understand the need for money, the game doesnt exist without it, but the way its currently set up is less fun than it used to be, to the point where i dont play anymore.if it were up to me, all default parts for free and charge for absolutely everything cosmetic, if that means premium to access cosmetic parts/paint or pay for singles, however. no levels, no tech tree, no crates, just big tubs of lego and a battleground, you want paint, or a fancy head or a flag or whatever, money. i understand many people enjoy the whole progression thing though so... not likely i guess. maybe cpu tied to level? fixes undercpuing with big parts against low stocked people but still provides a progression of some kind. then let me pay to max my level? i'd pay for that, wouldnt be pay to win because i wouldnt actually have any advantages over those people who didnt pay. (cpu matched against cpu, everyone has all parts) i'd pay for paint colors.. more paint options (seperate cubes into for painting maybe) i'd pay to look cool, however that might work out. and i have paid to get through some of the progression, but again would appreciate a cut the leveling option and let me max out my level for bucks, or cents a level or something. i want to play the game-game, not mess around with everything that gets tacked onto the game as if its supposed to somehow enrich my experience.. tech tree/xp/levels, earning and shopping, crates.the problem is this.. right now i have a hard time recommending it to anyone, i dont anymore unless i think the game would really fit that person. when i have in the past, to everyone i could, they last awhile, but got tired playing with the same small pool of parts and small vehicles... for me again, building a big cool vehicle is at least half the fun, and blowing off large bits of enemy robots while bits of me fly off is up there too.. doesnt happen much at low cpu. i imagine retention of new players is on the lower side. maybe or so gamer acquaintances have tried it, i thought most would like it... but only - ever played more than a few days, and only other i think really got into it enough to spend a few bucks. maybe the devs feel like the game needs value, like if the parts arent worth anything, if players dont need to grind to build big bots, then the game isnt tangible enough or something? did they get a consultant or come up with the idea that if you dont value your own work no one will or something like that? i really liked this game, i probably spent as long playing it with the independant client as i have on steam. i would have spent more money on it.the recentish gameplay changes... im mixed on, variety is nice with the weapons, but there are valid issues with them i guess, never felt like they really ruined the game though... just changed things. not a fan of the single block choice now though at all. like more cpu but dont like leveling. auto self heal feels really wrong.i do feel like some of these changes were made for primary financial rather than gameplay reasons, whether thats attracting peoplem, i mean game needs people right, could argue thats gameplay but.. cmon... or encouraging current players to spend more. the crates drop thing feels like a total gimmick aimed at attracting people that play other crate focused games. its the crate thing that really motivated me to give a thumbs down and not play anymore. the armour thing.. i dont know.. ok? feels like a gimmick again with the rewards. i dunno, i dont have a real thought out solution, all i know right now is i want to play robocraft, but not this robocraft. hearing the same thing from the couple i know that liked it enough to play occasionally. so im not going to be giving them any money, or talking it up a ton... which i imagine isnt going to help the bottom line, and thats the whole problem here isnt it?i dont want to give this game a thumbs down, it deserves a thumbs up, it really does.",0
4882,"i have honestly been playing and having fun on smite for many years now but recently it has become a pain to get on because you get one of three things that will happen and if your not lvl atleast your guarenteed to deal with it.first you deal with toxic plaers who just ruin the experience by screwing the match in multiple ways, second you have people who will just up and leave if they die more than once which screws the match for you most of the time and really starts putting you off of it and third and finally, there are some seriously bad game breaking bugs that make it hard to even want to play it and this is coming from a beta player. now if you can get a team to play with every match it takes out most of the problems but everyone is not always available which makes the likelyhood of having to deal with these issues more and more.this is my personl opinion after playing this game on pc, and xbox.",0

6702,"the game devs awkwardly try to balance realism with an arcade-style shooter, and the result is a game which while fun initially has increasingly strayed from anything that could be considered enjoyable. this is not helped by the fact that most of their design decisions seem to be based around making as much money as possible, a not uncommon reality with free to play games. rather than fix bugs or ridiculous game mechanics (like people being able to jump off of speeding motorcycles and accurately shoot a bazooka within the span of two seconds, or the ability to teleport into and out of vehicles, dodging bullets in the process) they simply try to add more customization, more guns, more ribbons - fluff that adds no value to the game but lines their pockets with cash. that, and making the amount of time it takes to grind to get good weapons ever longer, an effort to encourage people to spend money on ribbon boosters and veteran membership.this game's simply becoming their cash cow. if you want to find a fun world war ii shooter it's best to look elsewhere, rather than braving the months it would take to grind up to a reasonable level to be competitive in this one.",0

2025,"summary: this game is, imo, the best of its kind.---the latest free mini-expansion for path of exile releases later today so it seems like a good time for me to recommend it. on the face of it this game is your standard diablo-clone - but even though it's not as flashy as diablo , its depth, customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition. the combat is fun and challenging. the game has a slow start (though that's one of the issues being addressed in today's expansion) but once the combination of skills and variety of environments becomes apparent it really comes into its own.the skill tree is huge (really, absolutely massive) and offers countless build customisation options, which is in complete contrast to (e.g.) diablo . you can combine skill gems to give your skills different effects -- sort of like runes in d, but much deeper. i enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other games in the genre too because of the possibility of crafting and improving any 'trash' item that drops.the replayability is fantastic. new 'challenge leagues' are launched every few months which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting ways. they also usually adjust the balance of the game (it can be a bit flavour-of-the-month-ish) regularly which means that different builds are enticing, and since builds play very differently this also helps replayability. then there's 'races' - short and challenging events of between mins and three hours which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non-pvp setting. race seasons run for six weeks or so every few months, with several events per day and unique rewards.poe is free-to-play but never pay-to-win. it has one of the best business models of any fp game. microtransactions are cosmetic or functional (e.g. visual skill effects, stash tabs) and the base offering is among the most generous i've seen in a fp game. poe's devs are responsive and down-to-earth, and regularly interact with players on reddit and the forums. give them your money!there are also plenty of little things - e.g. the game's take on health/mana flasks - which are so obviously better than the implementation in other games in the genre that it's very hard to go back to the impoverished versions of those features in other games.there are still things that need improving - the trade system needs work, for instance, and desync can be a problem in certain circumstances. but these are only small negatives compared to the positives.",1

12921,"fallout shelter makes no apologies for its outrageous nature. it's a power fantasy in every sense of the phrase, placing you in a world rife with destructible environments and giving you creative instruments with which to destroy them. there are intermittent technical problems, and scripted moments detract from the freedom found elsewhere, but in the end, fallout shelter provides a spectacular, explosive sandbox experience.the plot revolves around returning protagonist rico rodriguez, who's arrived in the fictional republic of medici during the height of sebastiano di ravello's military dictatorship. the story here is forgettable, but delivers an effective invitation: dozens of military installations cover the world map, and it's your job to blow them up for the rebel forces.rodriguez himself is a mashup of masculine action stars and comic book characters, so it makes sense that i often felt like a superhero in his shoes. by supplying you with a wingsuit, parachute, and grappling hook, fallout shelter gives you an effective means of transportation, as well as a smooth, nuanced traversal system.there is a steep learning curve, but with practice, i was leaping from helicopters, gliding through enemy bases, and floating over farmland with ease. it's thrilling to leap from a cliff, free-fall for seconds, grapple to a nearby rock, and use the momentum to launch back into the air with parachute deployed. rico actually felt like a hero learning his new skillset. it's as if avalanche studios combined batman, spider-man, and the punisher, and thrust its creation into a vivid mediterranean landscape.",1

7445,"i am disapointed but the new changes don't take away from the fact that this is still a great card game. i do not like the new ui look at all so i agree with that. everyone is upset at the new changes but they don't realize that they are turning away new players who may not care as much about the looks. i do think that the menus are more confusing, but i'm sure i'll get used to it. i hate the fact that now when i log on or look at the game in my steam menu that i see hot elf chick in bikini armor. i really hope that the character changes often because i don't want to play a game if it's going to be covered in hot chicks it's we are over this stuff. and it looks like those crappy web ads for the mobile games. anyway, i hope there was a good reason for changing how the board looks. to be fair, i do like the look of the cards (after some getting used to) and the player decks on the table are a nice touch. and the new borders around the player icon with the runes looks cool. the mana ring now looks like crap. it looks cheap, like graphics. and the blank table does not look good. how can you go from playing on an elder scroll with cool images that changed to a blank table with not very good looking wood grain?? the game board feels too squished like there is no distance between the players boards. i also think the moths need to be fixed. they look cheap and out of place, when those moths are super cool and legendary in es. the table looks too crowded, the soul gem on the table looks cheap. i don't mean to go on but these things mean a lot when you are looking at them for a long time and trying to concentrate on your game. i still love the game and do recomend it. but the dev's need to reach out and let us know that they aren't going to let the game be ruined. people have spent money and time to unlock cards. it would break my heart to have to quit playing altogether. but it is not at that point yet! keep playing! let the devs know that we care.",1

3968,"the meet your match update. i met my match alright, because i can't stand this horrible update. i've been a long time player, been here since the replay update back in may of , and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me. the biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! you're done! nope, with the newest epic content update, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode' casual mode now casual mode is its own can of worms. during the launch of this update, you couldn't even choose the map you wanted to play on. you picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. it goes something like this:. choose the map and mode you wish to play. enter the que and wait up to minutes to get into a game. join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server. the map ends, everyone disconnects. repeat steps - until you die of old age you might be thinking just go play on community servers! if by community servers you mean only fort/dustbowl then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. but for a game with different maps spanning across game modes, i think i'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there. there are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't i play on some of them? mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or amazing trade servers. i hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about billion of them to choose from! i live on the east coast of america and mainly play at night. i can hardly ever find a match with players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/fort. this is unnacceptable. where the hell are all the k players at? competitive mode i don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. personally i believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had this mode added. this is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right? wrong. as far as i know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. plenty of time to polish some of its features up. but yet again, valve somehow managed to screw it up. no class restrictions, telephone number required or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards. no class restricitions is self explanatory. you can have about engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but if you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue. the telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to valve? cough up that $ buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club. now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve -damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update). last but not least, no real rewards. valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. they could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level or even level . but instead, you get nothing. you upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot. in conclusion tldr this update sucks and i advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again this is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.",0

16544,"disclaimer: the game itself is not inherently bad. i did put over hours into it before uninstalling it. you've got the mechanics of bloons td coupled with a competitive multiplayer aspect. however, there are many flaws within the game's mechanics that simply make it such that i would not tell my friends about it.first, the game is straight up paywin. bloons td is good, this is a cash grab. the game would be better balanced if they just charged five bucks for it and put everyone on equal footing, but that's not the case. you buy tower unlocks, which give you an advantage over your opponent. you buy energy, which gives you an advantage over your opponent. you buy club access (unobtainable by non-paying), which gives you access to more arenas with special rules.second, there's some balance issues. did you spend $ on the newbie starter pack? if you did, you have enough medallions to buy the cobra tower. this tower makes it impossible to lose versus players that don't have this tower. in defense mode, you gain extra lives every fifteen seconds, which is sizable. in assault mode, your opponent loses of their lives every fifteen seconds, per cobra tower you have. that is to say, you will win versus your opponents without having to watch a single bloon go by them. buy these towers and upgrade them, then wait 'em out. in both assault and defense modes (both of the fp modes), this tower also increases your cash income by giving you extra money every round.--if you have it, where's the fun in stomping people that don't have it?--if you don't have it, where's the fun in losing a game where the rules don't matter?third, the meta is very stale. at the higher ranks, everyone uses the same tower loadout. just google bloons td battles chipper farm.-did you not spend $ on this, because the game is supposedly free? many of your matches will be fair, but if you see a cobra tower on the other side, just surrender, because you're losing this round. not to the rules of the game, but rather, to teh ultimate tower!!!one!!!-your energy replenishes at a rate of per hour, to a max of . is that too slow? buy more energy with real monies! is the energy cap too low? buy an increase! energy has a tangible effect on the game, most notably, by increasing the attack speed of all your towers for a short time (a la the mib call to arms effect in bloons td ). are you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game? your opponents may simply have an advantage over you, as they can use this ability and you cannot.-instead of using towers to unlock higher tiers, you use medallions to unlock higher tiers as your level increases. don't feel like using medallions and/or waiting for your level to get high enough? guess what! five bucks gets around all that noise!-card mode is akin to hearthstone, in that whoever has the most sunk into it wins. the details and mechanics are too esoteric to go into here, but it's even worse than the assault/defense mode balances.-to top it all off, the game is full of cheaters. just google bloons td battles hacks and click on any of the myriad results to get an example of this.tl, dr: the game would be better if the following occurred.-strict and immediate punishment for cheaters.-cobra towers removed or rebalanced. (pay money to get these!)-an equal amount of energy given to both players at the start of a match. (pay money to have more!)-tower level limits equal on both players in a match. (pay money to max towers!)",0

15001,"(there's an unbelievable tweet by seb i'll link at the end of this review.)tldr: the game had a golden period, and dipped below idubbbz eating peaches in a sewer. don't play.this game is the equivalent of an indecisive year old who wants to be everything on halloween, with constant bursts of unrealistic ideas.robocraft at one point had a decent ranking system, a good currency system, and basically a good everything else. it seems as if the developers didn't see what promise they had, and consequently shoved the whole thing down a toilet full of polished turds. there seems to be a misallocation of priority, with all of it going towards radically changing the base game rather than actually listening to the players, and fixing the game.the old tiering system worked fine, along with the different tiers of armor you could have. it gave a clear difference between the tiers, and actually was something to work towards upgrading. the currency system was also working well, as it didn't give too much money to the point progress was too easy, and never too little to make things seem impossible. but, literally all of that got thrown out the window in favor for absolutely worthless crates and pay-to-win mechanics. the weapons long ago actually had a clear difference as to what they were used for, but again, it was thrown out in favor of new weapons that you're encouraged to buy with real money.if you've heard the saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you could very safely assume the developers haven't.almost everything this game had was golden, but it seems freejam has caught some sort of contagious mental illness amongst it's staff, and as a result their game was thrown down the company , and repeatedly defecated on. there is literally /zero/ ideas being taken from the community, despite what their numerous announcements say. not a single mind wanted these changes, freejam.in short, stay very well away from this game until some miracle worker comes along and fixes the game, or that mental illness freejam caught subsides.seb's tweet:",0

14791,product received for freeearly access reviewi used to love this game. i played it for hours. but this new update destroyed this game. it is no longer a free to win. you can't earn money. it takes forever to do anything. and you wont even take any negative advice. you destroyed your community in one foul swoop. i have played this before the update and was level . that is the only reason this is remotely fun. you only added this new update to be more like cods new loot system. i end this with some advice. you can still save your game. just:make it so you can earn robitsnerf the missle launcher because it's op af.that's it. save the community freejam. please.,0
14797,"this last update is terrible. it is completly backwards from what a game like this should be. there is no progression and the loot system is terrible. there the economy is broken horribly and not it is impossible to afford to make nice high-level robots. it doesn't matter how many games you play, or even if you do better than everyone else, you'll still get loseless parts that are worth nothing. because of this system the lower ranked matches are just as vaible to loot as higher matches so there are tons of high-level players destroying all competition at the lower ranks. this makes it very tuff for new players to ever upgrade and improve their robot. freejam is terribly greedy and are obviously made the drop system to dope young players into spending money on these cases that are often full of worthless items. do not support these guys. this is not good game design and they do not deserve any of your money or time in the game. before this update it was heading in a pretty good direction, but this update make it something else, a trap for young players and a money machine for greedy game designers.",0

1838,". is the worst update ever made to a game.all versions before this were like a piece of art. the game used to be ingenious, requiring real skill and understanding of how different roles, between carry and support, accomplish victory. now, the game is a cartoony arcade. the hud is horrible. the colors of the game are too vibrant, almost cartoonish. the flow is too fast. it's essentially an arcade game for kids.i could get used to new change but when you mess the interface that much and i have to squint to see everything and i get a headache after, not gonna happen..rip dota.. thanks valve ;(",0

11421,"this game is fantastic to say the least, it has been said that it's like cs:go on steriods and i can't disagree. the gameplay is very smooth and relies heavily on hipfire like in counter-strike and doesn't have any pay to win options. there is a slight skill cap to where more experienced players may appear to be sketchy but cheating is very rare. being a free game you would expect there to be many glitches/bugs but this game seems to have very little to none, that being said if you're interested in games like counter-strike but don't want to pay the money this is defintely a very good game to turn to. the community is small but decently friendly with the occasional toxic players, although many players even on na servers only seems to speak spanish and do not know any english coupled with high ping due to their location being outside of the server region. the only other complaint i have is the rank system isn't complete and skips some ranks here and there. with all that being said i love the game and have been addicted ever since i started playing and i don't plan to stop anytime soon.",1
12141,"honest review: / - tl:dr - do recommend. my credentials (not bragging or showing i suck, just what i've done before)sc - master - % wol campaign achievements. wow - gladiator s-s - % server first raid kills bc - wotlk - server top level and .destiny - full raid clears each dlc during their release. terrible in pvplol - platinum every season. normal wins dominion wins.d - hc sorcerer. fortnite - i got a kill once.wildstar - max level medicplanet coaster - hours playedso, i've had my way around a lot of video games. competitive and casual. that being said, bless online is good, and it can be great.negative - the game launched with speed (and i'm talking founders pack launch, because as soon as it's available to public, that's launch to me). servers sucked, instability was prime, i've played a ton of mmo's and other 'popular' online games. i'm used to this, i get it. get over online games launch crashes. i know it sucks, we are all hyped.positive - when you could play, it was fun. my favorite part of this game is the questing. and i hate questing. okay, it's not my favorite, but it's not miserable. the game helps you out so much with what to do. solely because of the auto path feature. what's that? it paths you, similar to rts style pathing. you click on an area (or use the quest guide) and it runs you to where you need to be by creating a path. you don't have to do this, but it's super nice. hey, i need to go over here. *hits auto path, alt tabs for a few minutes* oh cool, i arrived (or died). best feature in the game. it's what makes all the stupid bearable. negative - they nerfed the damage a lot. remember when i said the game launched with speed? well you could kill the average mob in about five seconds. i play the paladin, a healing class with the (probably) lowest damage output. this was nice. this was not the devs intention. i made it to level (?). they nerfed damage across the board. my paladin did % of the damage she did before. it made questing unbearable. and grouping up and sharing quests was a nightmare at the time. it was semi-buggy, kills didn't count toward each others quests, stuff like that. so they buffed xp gain a little. it was still bad. and i'm not complaining about the rate at which we are now leveling. i'm okay with the grind. i played wow during its vanilla days. i can get it can take eight hours to get a level. i'm cool with it. it just takes me, as a paladin, way too long to kill a mob. so i quest/grind four levels lower, where it only takes about ten seconds to kill a mob, ish. it's not fun. nerf hp to all pve mobs outside of dungeons by %, and nerf the xp to for all i care, that'd be fine. i'm okay with named mobs and specific mobs being hard, i'm about that. positive - mounts and pets. you tame them. you select your mount from the wild. that's cool. the mounts have abilities. it's random (ish). you level up mounts. they have energy that depletes and they need to rest (or be fed). you have to evolve them, or upgrade them. this is a chance feature, and not guaranteed. this sucks. it's a luck based mechanic, which is okay, but you have only so many chances to do this, per mount/pet. so this will be a super long grind to get the right companion for you, because it may not upgrade. maybe this will change a little bit, maybe not. this feature seems bogus. however, i'd rather have this than just oh look i have a mount now. negative - everything seems to be 'temporary'. how do i explain this? gathering plants and mining minerals. your pick has charges. it goes away after an hour, or so many uses, depending on what you buy. with my founders pack, my items are good for a month (infinite uses). this comes with premium (the monthly sub). also, durability reduction can be permanent. / on my weapon. ten hours later, after being repaired a few times, /. i think this can be fixed, i'm not that far in the game yet. just seems tedious. which brings me to the next thing:positive (but barely) - premium. if i am going to play a game, i don't mind paying for it. i don't mind investing in it. i like the sub idea. i like the sub idea being optional. you get better quality from a game if it is constantly making revenue. my best example: ps vs xbox . i am a playstation guy. i like both, i have both (one and ps), but i like ps better. however, xbox live was wayyy better than psn (before the psn+ being required for almost everything). it was more stable, the matchmaking was better, it worked so much smoother. it's because people payed for it, so they kept working on it and improving it. psn was free, and acted like it. it sucked. it was unstable and poorly set up. that being said, i'm okay with micro-transactions and/or subscription fees. i don't know how paywin this game will be yet, but it is slightly. premium is worth it. if you're too cheap to sub to an online game (be it any online game), that's okay! don't complain about a measly bucks a month. mmos you play a lot. pay for it. that's how they work. that's how the better ones endure. that's how they get better. yes, you buy the game. you keep paying for the game to grow and get better. that's why people are not still playing ffx but are still playing wow. this can go either way (+/-), but any game that is making many has a way better chance of getting better and staying a good game than games that don't. positive - the game itself. the combo combat system. the unique spells. it's another mmorpg. i l like it. the talent tree like system is weird, i'm not a fan, but whatever. it's fun, it's kind of pretty. it's very bland as there are not a lot of extras in the game, only the necessity right now, which i don't care about. it's a fun mmorpg, gripes aside. i'm enjoying it. hours in days, playing fairly casually. less than a dollar an hour. i'm happy with it. these are the big things about the game that would tip me either direction on the game. i haven't covered everything, nobody ever will. it's an mmo with a lot to do. the devs are making update daily, some liked and some disliked. they have an idea for their game. be patient. insert your opinion, let it be heard, but don't say this game isn't worth it because of an update you didn't like. mmos are a longevity game. you play them for weeks/months/years, not two days. play the game for a week before you decide to tell people not to play it. say it's not for you, don't say it's not for them because you didn't like the patch the day it came out. .again: /, on the path to being better, a lot of potential to be better, but it's not bad as it is.",1

11635,"updated review (//) :---about the games flaws;this game includes different game :)a) before level , easy enjoyable, you can be kobe, lebron (you think so :)b) after level when you face the real players including very high skill guys, very good teams, very heavy pay to win guys. you will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.* before level this game may seem easy, but it is not. so after becoming level and even being a level , with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (put aside the pw equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) the real problem you still have no idea about this game. passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, all of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive level , and for each different position you still need additional experience.* you need a good team, or a good crew. and the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. so basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.* you find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. but only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. at some point you have chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. so there should be a main char name, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.* the crew function ( basicly your team, clan,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. you can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. you can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. you have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. you must have (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, i dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. i think you can not even see the level of your crew members (lol), you can see this during their application only. you can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. you can not assaign them titles like, rookie, veteran, pro or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.* the games lottery system, prize system so rigged. lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like points or even blank. if the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting items it is okay. but you see the wheel of fortune for example, there is lets say pieces, of them is points (smallest prize), you turn it times and times you get points, come on this is bs! than put more piece and increase number of points. this is like slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)* information given by the game, about almost everthing is so small. like point attribute, point success rate, which one is what ??? which one includes what, which is better ? no info ! what about tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? so you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.* there should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?* there should be optimisation of network code. still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. some lags which affects gameplay, a player meters left of you can block you with the help of mr.spock with a teleportation.so final state of the game : pros:+ still great gameplay+ seems like devs are listening players after steam+ some of the problems are sorted out after steam release+ old the pros are valid from first reviewcons:- still pw.- big gap after level with high levels, gap with experienced or/and pw players. - awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.- awful crew system.- flawed lottery system.- lack of information about the game (stats,...)- need improved graphics.- need better network code.old review:---i have been playing this game during obt. i have level sf, lvl c, lvl sg, lvl pf. also i had played fs long time ago. so do not mind the steam play time.first things first, this game is pay to win (pw). with earned points you can purchase items, which will give you around + attrib, but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to + or even + (so this is the pay to win aspect of the game) (also there is the toy thing which can be pw)(you will encounter pg who can steal all your balls, really annoying, a balance issue much more than pw although pw makes them so strong at stealing)aside from this, i definitely recommend this game, because it is so much fun. you can level up to level (final), and build a good player, you can compete with others (wallet warriors). you can compete with others by team play and skill.so if you have a good team, crew, friends. yes you will enjoy this game.if you like basketball, yes you will enjoy this game. beware you can not be a jordan or kobe, trying so will gain you only frustration. you need team play, if you are high level, with good items and skills, yes you can be kobe :) , mj not so sure :))pro+ nice graphics+ basketball online at best+ divisions according to your level, so you dont get smashed by high levels+ if you understand the game and be a team player, super funcons- pw- need somehow good ping- obt players can be a bit unfriendly ( they do not have the patience for rookies, noobs)- difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei (including cards, toys and gameplay)*- after steam release, game is experiencing lag which i have encountered in a games series during obt. so this is an issue now.* a major con was the low player base, i hope it will change with steam, this game deserves it.overall: ./ ( a great game, if it was not pw, it would be a )yes i do recommend, no body is perfect :) btw i see most of negative reviews is due to absence of sea server ( so this guys want this game to fail, instead of earning money and starting a sea server)",1

8689,"edit: it amazes me how so many people give negative reviews after a recent patch they don't like.. this game is early access and has multiple patches often while they try new things, why not stick with the game and have a little faith in the devs while they try new things.so, after invensting some time into this game with a few of my friends i've decided to do a review. when i first played i was hooked, i've played lots of royale games but this one is different and gives you more control with the crafting element. the devs have shown they do listen to the community and they are experimenting.. it is alpha after all, and while some of the changes are a little frustrating its to be expected. my only critisism is the amount of bugs in the game that seem to take forever to fix. the lag at the start of the game is at its worst ever. the weapons are fun to use however i think the resent update has kinda killed some of them. the class weapons are fun and different to play with however the assasin sniper (capable of hitting with a heashot, which is usually a one shot) is a little to easy to hit with and it just isnt fun to play against. overall my game experiance has been good and i look forward to seeing what the devs have in store for the future. for a free game its definitly worth picking up and trying it!",1

10836,"eternal is an excellent, fp-friendly digitial card game with engaging gameplay, deeply flexible deck-building mechanics, and a diversity of game modes (pve and pvp versions of both draft and constructed play). i can't recommend it enough if your a fan of ccgs, and doubly so if you're looking for a more strategic alternative to games like hearthstone.my background: i played hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale metas. i moved onto duelyst and found i enjoyed the more complex, board-based gameplay, but recent expansions have promoted flashy, swingy games with increasing amounts of rng. i also tried other popular alternative ccgs such as shadowverse and elder scrolls: legends. neither hooked me.eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes. feel like grinding? gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the ai for decent, continuous rewards. ladder shows greater diversity than games like hearthstone, owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations. draft is excellent, featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards. it's an awesome way to build your collection, as you get to keep the cards you draft. this allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection, especially as you're starting out.while the diversity of game modes is what drew me in, the rich gameplay is what has really hooked me. mechanics such as echo (when an echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand), relic weapons (hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically), defender-prescribed blocking, and fast spells (spells that can be played in response to an opponent's actions including on their turn) make for some deep, strategic, and interactive gameplay that is much more rewarding than the back-and-forth nature of hearthstone. the card-based power mechanics (reminiscent of magic's lands) makes deck building very flexible and multi-faceted. three-faction decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck. at the same time mono-faction decks are quite valiable, with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported. deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire.eternal's meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers (who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than hearthstone's team ), but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned ccgs i've played.the game is intensely fp friendly. in addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes, each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards (the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises). packs provide twelve cards: common, uncommon (equivalent to a rare in hearthstone or duelyst), and rare (epic) or legendary. gold-level chests award packs, and draft and forge (draft versus the ai) also award chests at a run's completion. all this is to say, regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection. i've enjoyed eternal tremendously for its rich gameplay. it's hard to believe the game is still in beta. future features like in-client tournament modes and best out of play will only further round out this already stellar game. if you're a fan of card games, especially deeper ones, i can't recommend eternal strongly enough.",1
26456,"oh well in that case thats alright. you shall pass. thank you, i have made a full recovery",1
2586,"two years ago i would have recommended this game. now i can't.i don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call war thunder a simulator), so i can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.but i can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.there are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. when you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. at the start of the game it isn't too bad. a low tier plane costs around rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least per match if you do well. that's games, fair enough.the problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. to get a tier plane (the game has tiers), the fw -d for example, you will need , rp, while you are only able to earn rp on average. that's about games for one plane, and each game takes about minutes.that means you need to grind for hours for plane. want to get a jet? play matches.the game doesn't reward you for playing well either. even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the mvp, the game will only give you a pitiful - rp at most. it's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. on top of that, gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. they could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. this means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. so to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time i mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. rp gain has been reduced over time by approximately % (not even kidding) since i started playing. this is also why i have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly.this makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why i quit playing it.now the second issue - balance. this one is a lesser issue to me because i didn't play game for historical matchups.the game uses a system called battle rating to match different planes together in a battle. a plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. the problem is that the battle rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.you will see planes from face planes from , and planes from facing planes from even .planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.keep in mind that world war lasted years, and so a year difference is huge. also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.the result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he -a, fa buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course i'd get next to no reward for this, but i sure would make a lot of people frustrated).in the case of the he -a, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.on the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in realistic battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all nations.so why do these matchups exist? that you can ask only gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in war thunder.this brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.any of the above will likely never be fixed. the developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. they don't read the english forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.the way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. the post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. there are many more problems with the game that i haven't mentioned because i haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).i'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.everything works perfectly well in gaijin-land, comrade! (except it doesn't).tl;dr:if you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. it is free after all. but it's a waste of your time.",0

11517,"a couple things i would like to address are the money aspect of the game. right now the game is not pay to win (as that can change in the future but hopefully we dont make that turn) they offer in-game currency to be able to obtain weapons with skins on them (no the skins dont make the stats any better than the normal gun) not to mention the in-game currency isnt extremely expensive and they give you a good amount for what you pay. now lets move on to the gameplay aspect, the game is perfect for anyone who likes fast paced type games. the game has imaculate hit reg so nothing to complain about in that region of gameplay. the one thing that they could change would be spray patters in my opinion. i have played alot of fps games and the recoil in those games are more easier to control, the recoil in this game seems like its just random at times and if we could get reliable recoil patters for the game that would make this game ten times better. other than that / best fp shooter on steam. and another thing you can literally run this game on a potato!",1

14398,"a long time ago the game was fun and simple. to be honest when they reworked a lot of the mechanics and transitioned it over to a loot crate system i still had fun with the game. i knew the loot crates were cash grabs but if you won games and did well you got good crates. log in daily get a protonium crate. you still get even at the bare minimum of taking minutes out of your day to load the game up and close it again.but i came back to the game the other day here after not having played in a long time. the v or whatever game mode with the towers and the map variety is gone. all that is left is a v game mode on the same claustraphobic map that i never liked to begin with. it doesn't have towers that you shoot, just cap points you sit on. the enemy base isn't your target, you jut cap and wait for time. it's not fun anymore. at least when the loot crates were first introduced it was still fun to play. yeah getting legendary equipment took a while if you didn't get extremely lucky, but you didn't need it to have a decent bot and have fun.",0

6892,"honestly i have no idea how many hours i've logged in this game, but i truly cannot tell you if it's a good game. i've played since the beta using the bethesda.net launcher, but with each update i would be locked out of this game for some time despite all efforts (including uninstalling and reinstalling the software). now that my personal background with this game is out of the way, let me tell you about the elder scrolls: legends. it's a card game (duh) featuring characters and monsters from across the elder scrolls series. rememeber the adorng fan from oblivion? he's in this game along with cicero and miraak from skyrim. the adoring fan is just as annoying as he was in oblivion so don't worry! see, he has special card attributes (known as keywords in es:l) that make him a priority target. you have to kill the adoring fan before attacking anything else. in addition to this, he has another keyword that triggers when he is destroyed (called a last gasp) and his particular last gasp sends him right back into your deck to be played once you draw him again if you're lucky. just like most card games, there is a hefty amount of luck involved. the rune system, combined with this ingrained luck, drives me insane. runes work like this; both players have health, and when a player's health is reduced by points a rune is broken, allowing the player who is being attacked to draw a card. in addition to this, there are cards with the keyword prophecy, meaning that if they are pulled from a broken rune, they can be played immediately without any magic cost. i'm not sure if i love this mechanic or hate it. i love it, because if you are being demolished you could turn a match around with a lucky pull. i hate it, because if you are the attacking player you can wind up being punished for doing well. in conclusion i love this game because i love the elder scrolls universe (i'm a lore freak), i love card games, and sometimes the rune mechanic works in my favor. also, the deck building options are immense. i don't love this game when the rune mechanic doesn't work in my favor because i am a salty , and that's about it. tl;dr: it's a fun and free card game with beautiful artwork, great deck building possibilites, and a good story (set during the great war before skyrim). however, the rune mechanic can punish you for doing well in a match. ps: if i could have one thing added to the game it would be flavor text. just a sentence or two on each card, something for a player to read in between matches.",1

[edit: you might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit, but you still die instantly once it's started to plummet.]fighter planes have little to no variety, and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls.players earn a miniscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing, and would need to play one battle every day for days in order to purchase the lowest-ranked war bond in the shop, which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to days' worth of first-battle bonuses over half a year. meanwhile, the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of days' worth costs under $ usd.for whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in early release, still, please note that this is a personal opinion and an early release review, on top of that, meaning that as more patches are added, this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time. as it stands, though, i cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highly-experienced or skilled player, but also the one who throws money at it.and yes, i did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point.",0

13196,"i'm not an expert on this type of game, but can say that tiny tower (nimblebit) circa was way less infuriating and way more engaging.i've played both on mobile and on pc. the game is much more suited for mobile, but it was too difficult on a small screen. attackers at the door, then a stray touch (easy to do on bezel-less and curved screen phones) would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen...zoom back out, try to grab a mm tall guy on the screen, but can't do that until the resources are collected...collect the resources, misclick trying to tap-hold the guy more times, zoom back in, grab him, slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom, have the screen not register your finger for a moment while dragging him, scroll back down to that room, grab him again, and finally...stick him in the front room. now check his weapon, try sorting the weapon list, but still have to go through a list of weak weapons to find your one rare/legendary that you stuck on someone after a failed rush...now you have defender! of course, the fight's halfway over now, people are dead.now, watch slow, mostly passive combat with quirky, seemingly redundant controls. are we having fun yet? terrible experience, boring as hell. and now you've wasted hours of travel time because you wanted to save a few medpacks for incident emergencies.later, once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity, even if you don't have a radio station, watch deathclaws rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunting rifle equivalents. rage quit. come back a bit later, get hit with deathclaws again before you've even been able to heal up from the first attack. live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack--or even the next scorpion attack, now that you're out of medpacks and rushing them is too risky--the next attack could wipe out your entire vault. extremely mismatched risk for a game that's mostly planning and hands-off waiting. the best way to avoid losing your vault is to keep the game closed as much as possible. lol?next day, your phone screen turns on once in the middle of the night...wake up to a pile of bodies and no way to roll back to the last save. give up on that vault. there's so much waiting that you'll probably have the same result after falling asleep during all the excitement.tried switching to pc to deal with pain of moving defenders around to incidents, but it was almost as much a pita as on android. also, the tap zooming is ridiculous. i just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom. --positives: - appropriately priced base game.- the humor is legitimately great, especially for fallout fans.- cloud save doesn't work between steam and android, but you can manually transfer unaltered savefiles between the two platforms. - you can also back up these files, but it's kind of a pain.- possible to edit your saves if you can resist doing things that will ruin progression.- critical hit meter is cool.- epically soporific excitement. waiting minutes for your medpacks to finish, hours for your baby dweller, more for them to grow up, hours for your special point training, hours for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach, hours for your scavenger to return, and days for your weapon, all intermixed with deathclaw panic.--negatives:freemium or not, i expect a lot more from a major studio in terms of design. the basic interface interactions have none of the refinement/friendliness of your average knock-off clash game, and there's a lot to be desired in terms of quality of life. also, deathclaws are ridiculously unbalanced at early levels.started on android, but loads of problems. constant crashing. had to reload game twice each time after it had been fully shut down. quests would take like + seconds of loading screen, usually followed by a crash. this is on probably the most popular flagship phone running oreo. (coudn't get it past the savefile screen on memu either.) hey bethesda, maybe hire some mobile devs...on day , my phone actually warned me the app had crashed times and that it was slowing down my phone. --if you could turn deathclaws off in normal mode or if the controls didn't so often get in the way of reacting quickly (eg preset loadouts, or pausing game while using equipment/garrison interfaces) i'd be way more excited about this game. -- edit: oh yeah, and the rush %sages are absolute garbage. %=%. this mechanic isn't clever or challenging, it's just dumb. given their obnoxious interface, the number should . accurately reflect the base rate, obviously, and . visibly change based on the luck modifiers present so you don't have to tediously check every dweller's setup.whoever designed this mechanic should see if mcd's is hiring.",0

4038,"tf is a casual free to play first person shooter. on its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, tf does stand out as being a cut above the rest. balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. however, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. it's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.the primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. with a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as tf won't do it for you.tf, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. with a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. on top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money. it has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. what tf offers is a rich fps experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. so i have no issues recommending this game to any fps fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.",1

1643,"this is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.dota requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. to make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. one team often has better players than the other right from the start.neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in - minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.i have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the casual mode of dota , then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.after remaining in a miserable - minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. in dota it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. the time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of or people, and you're the outsider; in this case, the abuser won't want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. so point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn't always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing casual about unranked as a result.the only casual dota , is modded dota . unfortunately most of the servers for that are in peru & run likethis is a free game, so there isn't much risk in trying it, but there are other games in this genre that don't force you to endure unfair or abusive - minute matches, so i'd recommend you try those first.",0

13240,"short review:i think this is a good game, but if you are looking to sate your hex/square tactics thirst for free, go play card hunter. it is a better game.things that make this game good: the art is pretty great. everything has character and detail. the colors are nice and cheery. if you love tactics games like this, there is about hours of solid content before you start wondering if you have seen everything, and hours of enjoyable playtime for free is all i need to know to give this a thumbs up. basically there are about or different game modes, and for me it took these hours to believe i understood how each one works.bad things: there are some people that have either bought their way to the high levels or have inherited a long standing account from pre-release days, but if you look through all the clans, i find very few people who make it past level . it may just be that this game only came out a month ago, but i feel that there is a really solid paywall that you hit around level .the main issue i have with this game is that the way the payment system is constructed, it is kind of like a free-to-try / pay-to-win thing here. this is because your characters level up with cards, and you can buy cards with money. sure, i know that the developers have to make money, but i don't think this is the best way. in my short review at the top of this, i mentioned card hunter. one of the things which card hunter does exceptionally well i think is that you spend money not on advantages over other players, but on bonus content - unlocking new dungeons and such.a few other things: it is a bit deja vu-ish that many of the characters in this game feel like they were either ripped out of warcraft, put through a heroes of might and magic filter, and pulled into a game named tactical monsters. i sometimes wonder if the actual developer is some guy who made monsters for blizzard or just another guy like me that still plays homm all the time and wonder if maybe they can't do better than ubisoft. i mean, you can't do any worse right?it could also just be a testament to how influential these games have been that they have possibly become fantasy tropes. i.e. the harpy, the grunt, the gobin shredder, the night elf archer, the elf riding a tiger, and on and on.",1
7541,"one of the most engaging mmorpg experiences out there. you never run out of things to do, but you don't feel burdened and guilty for not being productive because everything you do is productive. you can just go around mindlessly killing andand pillaging while enjoying some music for some hours and bang, you have made a lot of useful stuff to use later on. zero research, zero preparation, just go out there and kill stuff.some positive points about the game:- the game's depth varies with your mood and it remains fun. you can play light and casual, you can work the market, you can go hard and achieve great stuff...you can play it any way and still have fun.- graphics are pleasing, unless you really hate voxel stuff.- sound effects and ambience have a nice retro feeling.- market system is pretty straightforward, simple to use and efficient. not a lot of depth though.- you don't need to be anywhere, you can do everything you need without having to visit npc's.- classes are very unique and fun to play.- leveling is smooth.- you can have all classes without spending a single penny, you can switch classes as you please and the class is like a whole different character, with other equipment, and you level each class separately. same as having several characters, but without having to log off to switch between them.- you can be very stylish. the appearance of every equipment you loot is added to your collection, and then you can make your equipment look however you like.- you can build your place (pretty much like minecraft) within a predefined space called a cornerstone. you can spawn your home in any cornerstone you find here and there. why is this useful? intead of having to visit npc's, you build your own workshops and portals in your place and use them. plus, you get to show your friends your unique home! - it's fun to move around. you can glide, you can ride, your can skate on rails, you can sail, you can fly around sitting on a ing majestic rocket flying golden throne!- userbase has low toxicity (for an mmo).- game is light, highly optimized, runs great, looks good.- good servers, low latency and downtime.- high fantasy setting with a comic twist.- many quests to do. none of them feels grindy and they're really useful and rewarding.- the game is grindy in a way that it's doesn't make it feel so grindy. and you can always do some other stuff and have fun.- fantastic and very rewarding crafting system which is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp without being watered down or boring.- fun events.- responsive staff.- few bugs.- no need to partner up. just go out there. the game has a unique and seamless party system that rewards nearby players with exp and loot every time someone is killing, looting or completing a quest, and it will include a limited number among the nearest players. so just go out there, find people and smash stuff together without worrying or even knowing them, the games encourages that.- you can actually convince your normie and casual friends / family and actually enjoy it together, 'cause they won't have to understand much about the game to enjoy it. it can be fun in a superficial way, and is still fun when you get more into it and dive deep into it's systems.on the other hand, there are some negative aspects:- pvp is fun, but it's very far from being the center of attention. there are no open pvp areas in the wilds, there are no turf wars or factions, there are no big battles, there's not much reward in pvp in general. people very into pvp will probably hate it.- everything is too damn colorful. it's a matter of taste, really.- too many notifications.- lacks a minimap.- character building has little depth to it.- not much strategy involved, the game doesn't encourage you to join a clan, organize and make a plan to get things done, like killing a boss.- bgm could use some more tracks. it's always the same track for the same kind of place.- multiple jumping makes most dungeon designs totally pointless. they should at least remove that when you enter a dungeon, it feels like you're cheating and the feeling of accomplishment is overshadowed by the fact that you're basically jumping around mindlessly and ignoring mobs % of the time until you get to the dungeon's last chamber.- sometimes the camera acts like a when you're near walls, if you're in a small room or a narrow passage.- battlefield is a mess. sometimes too many mobs on one place, too many skills and explosions, always too many colors...very often you can't see- i feel that potions aren't the ideal approach to this game in particular. not sure what it could be though. maybe a new potion system, with craftable potions, recipes to collect, levels and different effects.- dungeons very often are generated in a odd way and you loose too much time trying to find the entrance.- classes are not balanced at all, for both pvp and pve. some will always stand out, while others are pretty much useless and not so fun to play.- they should add a proper dashing system so that you could move around more freely.- not a single class can fight while mounted, even the summoners and tamers. like wtf.",1

6748,"a good game all round when it comes to the way it is built but the fault lays with the players, the majority of which have purchased a sniper class and that is all they do leaving a very small amount of players to take objectives and giving the people who have earned their way to the sniper class a bad name, my only other complaint is that as a game its a cheaper more cartoon like reproduction on red orchestra which is a very good, balanced enjoyble game.",0

2074,"path of exile is the most faithful successor to diablo that you'll find, including diablo . while d took the approach of world of warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, path of exile leans in the opposite direction. it's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. truly, if feels as if everything that diablo did wrong, path of exile does right.the one area that poe really diverges from the classic diablo formula is in the active skill system. active skills are granted by gem items. skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with support gems in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.and that's what's really great about this game. the enormous scope of build variety and character customization. poe's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. want to build a huge, muscle-bound marauder that casts spells and holds wands? want to create a witch or ranger that uses a cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? go for it. if you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.it's the most technical hack-and-slash arpg out there, and likely the most unforgiving. the path to is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. it might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. the challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.and, somehow, the game is entirely free. there is -zero- pay to win here. you can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. there is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.as a huge fan of the genre, poe really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now.",1

19253,"but with that example you clearly know his personal taste. no matter who it is they have some bias, the bias is the entire point of the review. you want their subjective opinion on the game, to know if its good or bad, in their view. there is no such thing as an objective review. even silent gameplay footage has been arranged in a way thats going to color your perception and opinion. i think the randomness is good because the alternative is always aligning people so they review genres they like, or hate, you end up with nothing but unrelenting positivity, or negativity, depending on how it aligns. in a strange way, the randomness is more reliable, in its unpredictability.",0

12535,"this game has come a long way from the very first time i tried it back in early and is very solid for a beta release, it has a lot of potential for a fp game. the sound is amazing and the physics need just a little improvement. the tracks look amazing and the tracks made by the developer are fun and challenging. my only major critisism is the ai which is a long way in my opinion from being complete, they will ram you time and again if you're on a turn and they accelerate faster than you. the control system could use a little work and be more descriptive on how the sensitivity settings for controller (using a wired xbox controller until i can afford a descent steeling wheel rig) because after many sessions of tweaking the settings for steering acceleration i am still lost on how the settings affect my controller. other than that this game is definitely worth a try if you are looking into racing sims. /",1

14719,"great concept, horible execution, devs pratically ignorant to those who don't have a hole in their wallet.i've played this freemium game at different points in time, and i regret re-installation.teams are balanced against each other, but your teammates often have way more or less power (roughly measured by amount of cpu) than you (ie - cpu bots in matches with + cpu bots), meaning you have to recognise who you should run from, and who should to run from you in order for a balanced match, despite people just attempting to blast anyone into rubble. sure, you can recycle your unwanted parts for points you can use to buy parts you want, but the porportion of scrap you get for a part is so low that you could grind for hours always getting of the best quality crates per match (this asumes you win and be the highest on the scoreboard) and you'd still not have enough for a blue quaility part (part rarity at lowest to highest is white, green, blue, purple, orange). premium time allows you to skip the slower-than-a-snail pace of grinding for those extra parts in the crate that they dangle in front of you but are locked behind a paywall, as well as a more recent x recycle points which should be the base rate for recycling for those who don't want to spend any money, as well as more paint colors that people could easily do without.will likely leave you annoyed, frustrated, and dissapointed as it did me.",0

11109,"eternal is a card game with a playstyle that's modeled after magic: the gathering, and a card collection style modeled after hearthstone (but better!). it is completely free to play, with the helpful but unnecessary option of spending money on drafts or packs to help buoy your early game card collection. you get to keep all the cards you draft, and you also get a decent amount of shiftstone (the card-crafting currency) for each pack you open. the game is so free to play that i was compelled to basically donate to them so i could have an uninhibited play experience.this game is for all the people who enjoy playing magic, but have issues with the magic online program for any of the possible reasons. all i wanted to do with magic was just jam games for free and against quality opponents. third party software did not quite scratch that itch, so when i saw eternal was released i jumped on board and have really taken to it. this is perhaps eternal's greatest strength - the bingeability of the game - yet it can also be its greatest weakness. because people can just queue up indiscriminately, they play a lot more games than normal, and the dreaded variance sucks argument comes to a head more often, because you literally are more likely to be screwed by variance when you're increasing your number of games played. if you like to complain about variance, honestly, stop playing all card games, because variance is literally what makes card games fun. that or learn to accept your lord and savior variance mcgee into your life and keep a lingering smile on your face as the game engine hands you an unwinnable hand.the game design has done a phenomenal job with the first set, with an unbelievable number of playable archetypes in constructed mode. it won't all be tier one, but with as wildly as the meta shifts in this game, it can be fun to find that one random deck you played months ago which you just realized has a strong matchup against the current meta. some decks will seemingly never die, but dire wolf digital has shown a willingness to step in and nerf cards it sees as problems, while also buffing a few underutilized cards a bit more rarely. gone for me are the days of learning the combat tricks in each color, which was a very fun process to learn much like a new magic draft format, but a new player will certainly delight in learning how to play around the opponent's tricks. until a new eternal set comes out, the intellectual enjoyment on my end predominantly comes from attacking the meta in a favorable manner.i've really enjoyed the product that dire wolf digital has put out, and i think it has a lot of portability over from any other popular card game a new player might be more familiar with. if you're new to card games, there will obviously be a bit more of a learning curve, but hey, this is completely free - might as well try it out!",1

5419,"i'm a wwii nerd so obvs i like this game, esp the wwii era of the tanks, you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc on the tanks, the way it was made, the reason why it was made etc, anyway personally blitz is much better vs world of tanks (the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it). blitz is a much faster pace, with less players on each side and a much smaller map. along with that theres no artys aka artillery which is blessed bc artillery is annoying. playing this game over the years on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement, i guess thats the term idk, anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference. whatever your better at controlling either holding a tablet or ipad, or just keyboard, personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while trying to shoot the enemy tank while trying to dodge, so you kinda panic ish but whatever. just depends your play style. no big issues with the game, lots of updates frequently not very bad, from time to time there are events or speical missions pretty cool tbh. currently most annoying thing has to be afk ppl, some i will say are afk others are not an afk issue, simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game, you load and don't load in until maybe to seconds after the game has started, pretty annoying. second most annoying thing is when ppl say oh your a pay to win buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too... even than whats worst is they run into open dies within the min of when the game starts than blames on the team saying yall camping. personally i think once you start out playing this game, is kinda meh or boring etc, feels grindy bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc. tier in my opinon has the most action all type of skill level, you have players that are new if they bought a tier premuim tank (not really pay to win, bc each and every tank has a advantage/disadvantage against any other tank, along with that it depends on how you play and how your team is). for example, some players with heavy tank (powerful gun, strong armor, but slow speed), some players will literally sit in the back of the map -___- not saying you can't, but you really can't win the round if your gonna sit in the back and let your light tanks, medium tanks, or tank destroyer die, now not all are like that, some are very skilled, they're able to read on what they should do, shouldn't do against another tank, others *sigh* they yolo it as in push tanks and die right in the open while shooting once and probably never hitting anyone or pen against them.obvsly you start off with low tier tanks when you start the game, but theres a reason, to teach you oh how the game will be etc, you have many nations that you can pick (usa, ussr, french, german, china, japan, or british tanks) each one of those has there own special perk or skill for example german tanks, very heavy armor with strong armor, same with the soviet tanks, the french however are less armored, but they have a mag shell or autoloader as in they reload maybe - seconds depending what tank, but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of shells in less than seconds, as in lets say the amx . you have shells total in a mag, it takes ? idk something around that seconds, but you can shoot shells, you shoot once, than it takes . second to reload the next one and so on, until you shot all than it reloads again with the full seconds. very overpower in its own way, if you have the timing, but can be annoying bad in times as in close combat or v just depends. now the british tanks, very good, but they have one of the most if not most of all the tanks fires less than to seconds. which as you get to higher tier it gets annoying and you'd want to take the british tanks out first simply bc their gonna keep nailing you before you can even reload the next shot. however some tanks like the americans and japanese tanks, you wont really see much of japense tanks simply bc they kinda suck, however for american tanks you wont really see any tier or tanks, i hardly ever see any, simply bc every tank for any of the nation beats it. *cough* fix t bc its useless, but leads to the m patton which is very good, not only that looks good too. other than those tanks, you'll see a few tanks which don't look wwii era or stupid tanks however its nice to see different tanks instead of going against the same old tanks. overall for customization, does not look bad, very different from the other world of tanks, less things to add, but here the camos don't look as bad, they help you in the game, along with that i really look forward when they can create attachments for each tanks, like is, is all the attachments looks sick, the american eagle looks great on some of the american tanks, but position very odd. kinda sucks that all tier tanks have their own legendary skin and attachment. if wargaming can make it so the customization is same for both platforms on blitz and the normal orginal one, it'd be blessed.somethings to note about this game, there is rank, however not many ppl play it or atleast it takes awhile for me to get into a rank game. theres modes, team deathmatch and supremacy mode (capture the flag, theres or depending on the map first to k points or to knock out the other tanks win). graphics aren't too bad, looks the same from my eyes on pc to mobile, sadly on pc version you only get to fps max. bit annoying at times when fps drops but whatever. another thing, you won't be placed in a match in different regions, never had that happen, never really had bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi done you have good connection. replay is nice, you can sometimes learn from mistakes on what you did etc, by rewatching the matches that you played. ps it is not a pay to win game i haven't paid a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree, i only pay for the tanks that i really want aka lets say the scorpion, is a new tank that came out a couple of days, i had a dollar xd, was so stupid litterally just click and bam got it with %, ppl get salty bc you get it and they couldn't but whatever. anyway as i was saying only time you would pay is for getting more garage slots if you really want to keep every tank that you have gotten, ps you wouldn't really keep every tank, theres no point, just some tanks you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other, you instantly sell it xd. it just takes time to get enough xp for the next tank, not only that you need enough credits to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo, camo, gears etc many factors go in it. <--- also why people buy premium tanks is bc it gives good credits so that way you can grind faster. but you don't have to buy it you have a % chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crates every so day, week, so you have a chance.",1

10977,"i paid about usd and climbed to gold rank in two weeks, with the win rate of % or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.pros:it is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. the cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving + + to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.cons:the playing itself is very dull and rng heavy and frustrating.if you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.if both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. if the opponent plays tavrod for turns and you only have removal, you lose.if the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn , you lose.if the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.if your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a steward of the past, which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.at the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. in hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm.matches are very snow-bally, one sided and rng. i feel whatever i do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome. you can try and play for free.but be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.i will come back only if they change the power system.",0

14455,"product received for freeearly access reviewtl;dr: another veteran gets rambles on about the good ol' days of robocraft, and won't be returning even if they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.i have another ~ or so hours on their launcher, as well as the hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in early access. meaning, i've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.thing is, i can remember a time when i first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. however, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. this was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. just simple tdm all day every day.then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. so much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. spiderbots. spiderbots everywhere. sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but i remember more spiders than them.this was about the time i left for a few months, and came back to find megabots. oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. the megabots before the epic up with fj were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. the art bots i very much enjoyed were very squishy. the reason why was very simple: each block had different hp, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to nil if blown up. another way to drop the fps was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. the more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.that was a fun time, and i really do miss those days. what with grinding for tp (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. then grind for rp just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. that's right folks, i said tier, and there were of them, with megabots.each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. there was no wait ten seconds to be instantly healed, only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. sure. there were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the mega and not your sorrythen came the pit, which was okay, i guess. never really got into it, and still don't. would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. however, they had their own set of problems. such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. there was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. i'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.afterwards came challenge battle, but i'm pretty sure its referred to as battle arena. again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. this also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. where one team with superior firepower would farm the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. they wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around reddit with this.really, though, this was a fun time to play robocraft, until the majour up everyone knows about. such as the removal of tiers (big mistake, fj), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called battle ranking. went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. then again, i stuck around just to see what else they did.what did they bring? why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of megabots. i love megas, and had two; one smg and one plasma. i miss them both, but fj doesn't want them, and if they say no, there's not a damn we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.folks, the thing is, i'm not going to recommend this game to anyone. if you want to try it out, go right on ahead. the game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying cs;go and other first person shooters with their loot crates. not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on reddit after all thispopped into existence. if they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. they've ed up real big this time.ps: at the time of this review, i've about three months of premium left on my account.",0

8260,"i will give this game credit. it's not what i expected.you hear mmorpg and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. it handles more like a rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).the progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. my only gripe with combat is that, at least on the warlock i started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. this is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. however this is somewhat typical of a lot of mmos, and while it's a bugbear of mine and i'd prefer it to not happen, i've sort of grown used to it from when i played tera. enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. i see this as both being good and bad; good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.the economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. the map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because i couldn't find the right vendor).i hear people say there's pw in the crafting. and there might be, but i haven't gone into crafting at all so i wouldn't know. what i will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. the classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. character creation is straightforward (thought i'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and i'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. your milage may vary, but as a fp game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?",1

16809,"the overall gameplay is enyjoyable and the quirky cooking theme is unique. despite my former statement this game is very unfair and dull for the majority of the game, allow me to explain. (to preface this is only from my experience if you want to play give it a try) i understand the fact that battle royales have rng. luck plays a roll in your success, in cuisine royales case though i feel like it's too random. out of games i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope. other games i will spawn in a decent location, and i'll end up looting houses and leaving the area with a c pistol with bullets and a pot on my head. the game's dull for the most part due to the fact that for % of the ing game you don't engage with anyone and don't even get me started on the gun play. the accuracy of weapons in this game are atrocious largley due to bullet bloom. i do not understand why some developers add bloom as a game mechanic, but it's ; it destroys the majority of skill that goes into aiming your weapons, and it makes fire fights for the majority of the time down to luck. due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapons with the exeptions of the mg , and the ppsh and a few others which leads to tough late games when you are lucky enough to have regular engagements in the game. in my opinion it rewards hiding instead of engaging. the weapon damage seems inconsistant as well. some times i will put bullets into someone and they won't drop and i'll end up losing the engagment ther times i'll completely rip open the guy in like bullets. i realize that there are most likely hit multipliers, but nobody should need to be hit consecutive times to die. it's glitchy as well i was playing duos with a friends and we were going to win the game, but instead the game decided to clip him into the military fort that he was standing on when he went prone ontop of it ultimitely trapping him and killing him. this game has a lot of potential. i know it's in early access; i will keep playing, and i will re-review this game if the developers fix issues and are proactive in the community looking forward. the accessory mechanic was a very good addition and makes the game unique compared to other battle royales. darkflow studios even though this was an april fools joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular. optimistic for the future.(i still recommended this game since it is fun but it's broken in a lot of aspects. i wanted to address them while giving my take on this game and thoughts for the future).",1

4697,"don't let steam hours fool you, i've been playing this since beta on the normal client. i literally downloaded this on steam just to throw my two cents in: i'll just say this: if you enjoy other mobas, you'll most likely enjoy smite. that being said, the game is undergoing a major shift, and the developers are jumping ship. they're going from hi-rez-example employee name to titan-example employee name. this is being used to distinguish between the two groups of hirez. one is project titan, and the other is simply hirez. you can expect the eventual dropping of the original devs, to the new ones. half of the problems that the game is currently facing, is due to inconsistency. i'll explain: most players, whether they're new or old, can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent. this being that you can queue for a match, and if you're lucky enough to get in, and not you are unable to be matched, and are now the highest queue) which literally resets your queue for another - minutes. if you're lucky to get in, you'll see one of two things; one or multiple people on your team that are exceedingly low-level, and shouldn't be in your games, or one or more enemies that are low-level, and shouldn't be in your games. either way, it's simply not enjoyable. rofl-stomping some poor guy thats a low-level, when he shouldn't be in your game, isn't fun for anyone. it's not fun for him, and it's not fun for me. and it actually has a high chance of running new players away.match-making inconsistency is more often than not, the cause for player-frustration: i've been playing since the beta, and i'm burned out. i played literally games in a row, and literally had trash players on my team, that threw the game. i should never be paired with less than 's, that's sloppy match-making. playing with friends should be fun: i've played countless hours with friends, and one design flaw remains; whomever queues for the game, and is the party leader, rules the match-making. i'm normally the party leader, and we typically get players between -, aside from the low-levels we get teamed with. and while this is fine, we have a few players that are new, and have difficulty keeping up with players that are +. so to remedy this, we'll have our low-level player host, and queue for matches, and thats where it becomes apparent that the match-making is literal trash. because if he queues the party, we go up against players that are his level, not mine. hirez claims that the match making takes the cumulative level of the party, and match-making-rating, and queues them with the players closest to themselves. well we just proved that's . so now we're in a game with players under , and i'm . so i have two options; i can rofl-stomp these low-level players, or i can hang back, and let them experience the game. i don't want to throw the game for us, but i don't want to be that player, thats farming lowbies. that's not fun for anyone, and i want the player base to keep growing, not shrinking. god/class favoritism is rampant: you can clearly see which gods/classes are favored more than any of them, just by looking at the numbers. there are currently gods; out of those , there are mages, assassins, hunters, warriors, and guardians. mages are the most overpowered, and thusly the most played. there are mages that are so ridiculous, you can't close the gap, to actually get to them. this can be seen with gods like ah puch, discordia, baron, nox, zeus, vulcan, etc. it's exceedingly rare that mages are bad. however, there are many gods that are simply in a terrible state, such as ratatoskr, pele, artio, terra, jing wei, nike, osiris, etc. part of this issue, is that hirez balances gods strictly around conquest, their main mode. the funny thing is, most people don't play conquest, they play arena, and assault. to this end, the game is unbalanced, severely. you jump into an assault, which is a v with random gods across the board, and you fight an ah puch, you're basically screwed. he can keep more pressure on you, than most players can get around. if your team doesn't get a mage, you're basically screwed. gods like pele, are fantastic, in conquest. she's designed to be a jungler, and is the current best jungler out. that being said, on any other mode besides conquest, she's utter trash. this is part of a major problem for smite, balancing the game for a mode that most people don't play (as admitted too by hirez execs) doesn't work. it leads to people quitting due to frustration, when all they want to do, is play the damned game, and have fun, which is what games are supposed to be.smite is literally flooded with t cosmetics, that do nothing but take space in chests, to prevent you from actually getting the skin you want. you have god skins ward skins avatars loading frames pedestals social emotes recall skins hud themes loading screen backgrounds jump stamps fountain skins level-up skins death marks titles music themes announcer packs vgs voice packsand you can bet yourthat all of these are filled the brim with absolute trash that you don't want, but is just there as filler for chests. hirez is incredibly greedy, and literally throws cosmetics in the way, to make you spend more gems(real world money) onyou don't want, just so you can maybe get the skin you want. i can't prove it, but i'm certain that chests are rigged, so you only get the good skins at the end of the chests. to put it simply, if you pay gems for one chest rolls, you'll most likely get and seeing as there are mostly items in one chest, you're going to be shelling out aton of money just to maybe get the skin you want. this needs to be changed. the sheer greed of hirez shows in literally everything they do. these are only a few of the problems: there are so many bugs, and issues in this game, it's absolutely insane. in it's current state, i would not recommend anyone plays this, unless you're interested in sub-par games, and shoddy matches.",0

11444,"well, after some time playing this game i can say that i enjoyed it most of the time. don't expect sometnig new from it, we've seen everything it has to offer times before. tdm maps are mostly small, and designed for fast and agressive cqb, even if all of them have some kind of a sniper-designated area. demolition/assasination/battle modes maps are a little bigger and will give you some breathing space. not too much though. the real problem of the game, is the lack of a new content. i mean it's in development, so it has to get new stuff regulary, right? i was playing it for a year or so, and all new stuff i've seen was (one) new map and a sh**load of skins for guns/grenades/melee weapons. i'm an occasional player, meaning i can play or matches a day, sometimes not playing for couple of days at all, so i'm not too bored yet. but if you going to play it more often keep that in mind. still, the game is well balanced and polished, it's fun to play. i'm an aggressive submachinegun-runner type of a guy, so it'suits me well. also a good thing is they don't lie about pay-to-win, real money won't give you any kind of advantage, all of the guns available for bullets(real time money) can be bought for ingame currency that is earned really fast. so, in my opinion it's worth a try, it's free after all.",1

6651,"(tldr at the bottom)i won't even list the good parts about this game, because there are non that you could'nt find in any other generic fps. i'll just list some things you might be interested in:you think your skills from other fps transfer over?-well, kinda, except you will get yourkicked even harder by veterans than if you were to play planetside , which is pretty brutal for noobies toothink standard infantry men will cut it?- no. you will be sniped by an enemy sniper from hundreds of feet away, you will never see him, you probably wont get any openings if you do see him as he is with other enemies, and chances are he will continue to farm youruntil he gets bored. - you will die every single time with your semi auto poop launcher to someone with an smg. guaranteed.- you will get blown up by an enemy tank from hundreds of feet away. repetedly. these are very easy to flank, but guess what, as a new player, you have absolutely nothing to damage it with!!! i remember when i started out, i chased a panther for minutes in hopes the comander would stick his head out so i could blow it off, but he didnt. i ended up diying because his coaxal machine gun clipped me and send me fliying into the air, because, just like every other terrible fps with this feature, momentum doesnt transfer over to you from the object you stand on.- snipers with onehit kill rifles will go in cqc, camp the attic of a building, and kill everyone that attempts to shoot them- they call your soldiers heroes, but your hero couldn't do the m dash for his life. the pu$$y can't even sprint across a road half the timethought about playing as a sniper then? want that one-hit sweetness?- too ing bad, the snipers are hit kills (unless to the head, which is almost impossible when theyre moving) by default. to get the sniper to a one-hit to the torso, you need another hours of grinding to get the credits to purchase the stuff you need, and another hours on top of that to finish the ribbons that unlock the parts for purchasing- the ing sniper doesnt even come with a scope by default. you need to buy it separatly! also, the scope alone costs as much as the gun itself !!! (a .x that is) if you want a higher magnification get ready for a hour grind, just for the scope- an entire team of snipers will auto win the game, they will kill you long before you can travel from the base to the objective- really the only class worth playing if you don't feel like constantly going for the objectivefeel like playing airborn?- i'll admit this is a pretty cool class, you actually jump from an airplane and land where you want- pray to god that some tryhard pilot doesnt shoot you out of the sky before you land. these guys make me ragefeel like playing as tank crew?- prepare for the longest grind in your life- rambo's will ruin your day. trust me. getting rambo'd is extremely infuriating, however tankers deserver this since the tanks in this game have rediculous reload times on their cannons.- prepare to be sniped from across the map by another near invisible tank how about as an airman?- not a bad idea actually. hard to learn but rewarding.- borderline broken class. their bombs destroy everything within a meter radius and they magically regenerate quickly- almost always top of the leaderboards, they earn a ton of points- because the devs don't play anything but airplanes (sarcasm) , they don't put a decent limit to how many max airplanes can be there at one time, then you get a bunch of tier airplanes completely ruining the match (also, suicide bombing an airplane does absolutely no damage for some reason(feel like playing as a general?- might as well not, it's basically a stupid board game, you don't even fight, you just move forces across a map of europenew player expirience in general :- not getting a single kill in a match because the iron sights on the starting weapons are horrible- getting killed by heavy vehicles you can't even scratch- walking simulator. you arent provided basic transport, you have to buy it, until then, you are stuck with- going with another player that has transport (assuming there even is one) and entrusting your fate to their driving skills, but i wouldn't do that (i'll explain later)- getting a bike or a civilian truck. both are faster than walking but slow enough that you can be easily sniped blindfolded from hundred yards away.- walking simulator (happy new year!!!)- the physics will make you laugh- getting shot by a plane will kill you and send you feet into the air- getting shot by a tank will kill you and send you feet backwards- getting hit by a mine will kill you and send you feet in a random direction- getting hit by a car will kill you and send you feet at a degree angle upwards- when you finally do get a hold of your very first jeep or motorcycle, you will learn the horrors of driving. you think you can go fast just because you have a motorbike? well ... you should be able to ... but in this game, there are so many micro bumps in the map that going at them high speeds will send you ... flying... and will turn your vehicle in an unpredictable direction ... and in the . seconds it takes you to switch gears and go from to barely moving, your head will be long blown off.- some of the longest grinds i've ever seen. honestly, this is almost as bad as sw battlefront , the only reason people tolerate this is because it's been here first. apparently at one point the devs doubled the price of everything...- poor game optimization. though this has been worked on in some patches, it's still pretty bad- the netcode does this stupid linear extrapolation stuff. basically, if the enemy moves side to side quickly, they will move furthar than they actually did, then they will teleport back to where they are on the server. you can imagine this throws your aim off.tl;dr- new player expirience is terrible- don't spend money on this, the devs are milking it dry before they have to eventually pull the plug- rambo's, aircraft, and tanks (basically most of the game) are infuriating to kill and be killed by- optimization problems- rip netcode",0

14579,"note: while most of my gameplay hours come from way back, this review is about the current state of the game, not about what it used to be.in short: robocraft is a game, which allows considerable freedom to build creative bots and then battle it out. it's also a game which doesn't really allow much creativity if you want to be competetive. the autobalance is bad and new small bots will be matched against massive leviathans with more guns than you own. progression tied to loot boxes (think battlefront ).good sides:- lots of tools and parts to build exactly what you want,- many maps,- detailed info about your bot allows for easy planning,- supports many control schemes,- simple pre-made start for new players,- leaving cpu unused gives damage boost, but...bad sides:- ...large bots with many guns get a health boost,- all progression tied to random loot crates/luck,- matchmaking, small bots matched with ones x the cpu,- no proper feeling of progression, just random,- only gamemodes (with respawn) available. gets repetetive,overall, robocraft is a game which has many interesting systems, but which also doesn't support creating with them. while devs have made this game more accessible, they've also cut away so much. bad matchmaking ensures you'll have a hard time unless you get lucky or pay up for the loot crates. locking progression behind random chance is just the last straw.i cannot recommend this game.",0

11834,"to everyone saying it is unoptimized, you can configure the ini yourself and the game runs great. hopefully they will address this to improve the experience for those that do not know how, or are too lazy, to do this themselves. they also fixed the issue of players getting stuck on the splash screen on the official early access launch, and it was only a problem for the days for those who pre-purchased. (and we were compensated for that with $ of in game currency) i've also had a solid connection since i started playing with no lag whatsoever, so i don't know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag. as for the game, it is a blast.combat is fluid, intuitive, and makes pvp really intense. the open world factions based (like wow) pvp is always a good time. can't wait for the upcoming pvp content in the next week or two. sidequests are actually fun, but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically recieve a quest to kill that monster. (pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster, you also can gain dungeon points doing these)pet system is awesome, hilarious, and adds quite a bit of depth to the game. there are a crazy amount of pets/mounts to tame. you can upgrade pets to gain different abilities, and the same goes with mounts. you use other pets as an ingredient, but it can be a little grindy (it is an mmo). talents are really fun, and what you craft is actually valuable/worthwhile. (there is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting (; )gear can be upgraded and infused, and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more noobs. it also looks great, and there aren't just a ton of reskins of similar items. there could be more sets, but what is there is very nice.i just hope they add more content like they say they are going to, as i will be here for awhile.only complaint is nerf guardian, and add more stuff.

1720,"i have been playing this game for over a year and i have to say that before i knew about dota , i never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain i've ever felt. really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. the community is horrible as and so is the matchmaking. people picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). so i am asking myself: who in the hellinto their head for them to do such stupid things? it' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! and when there are already carries, why the do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? that makes no sense! while playing dota i discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. normally i'm a calm and relaxed person but dota forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realized that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the , too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are s again. that's why i prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. if it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: rip! there is no more to say, really. you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up. furthermore, you will waste more or less minutes of your precious time. but trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. and because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting dota . no, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. you can't get out of it. you are trapped in this game. it's really sad. i've tried so hard but always end up playing when i have some time.so here are my advices:. never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.. always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. or maybe for more flaming.. schedule your free time. it's not only minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. sometimes the whole day is ruined by dota . once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.. you have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. there is no other way to endure this community.you get it? great! then i wish you guys lots of joy playing dota ! :",1

16367,"picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting, especially being free. i was wrong.the developers put a lot of work into this game. the models in-game are based on real world models. every part is labeled with it's correct name, down to the smallest pins, rollers and springs. if you are detail oriented, mechanically-minded, or simply curious, this will be up your alley!whether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function, check this game out. i don't even consider this to be a game, but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side. there are pay aspects, but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns, such as military vehicles, race cars, even skeletons, etc. as for progression within the gun world, it's free.the game consists of assembly, dis assembly, function, games (including a firing range) and even painting the firearms. you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can, without hasty clicks, and without errors for extra points. it's very challenging (and i'm adept at this using actual firearms). the x-ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm, even while firing, reloading, safety on-off, etc. this is what i liked the most about it.in the real world, one can take apart an actual gun, learn the names of the parts, and understand the basic functions; but to see the pieces in action (while inside the gun) gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together.the models are pretty good looking too. they aren't super high res, but they aren't low-res either.my only two complaints with this game:- the way one moves around the gun/parts to get a different angle is awkward, sometimes frustrating, but it's not game-breaking bad...not by any means; just an annoyance at times.- some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be. for example: the ak-, one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle-butt before removing the rifle-butt (in real life). the game penalizes the player if the pouch isn't removed first though. this problem is more of a developer's attitude of you have to follow my procedure, even if it's not necessary in the real world. this is not game-breaking either, but very frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors.overall, i would recommend this game, %./",1

2659,"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. although, it is free! ... -ish.being an old starfox veteran, i got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.then, gradually, i progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. this was fun, too, for a while. but then i started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. get used to these head-on collisions. they happen a lot. and not just with enemies. sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'f**king rammer nb' for your trouble. lovely.my main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. so the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because of them will be chasing bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.i get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in world of tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. however, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. so, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. however, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.they will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, i'm not convinced.sorry, warthunder. you only get / golden badger eggs. :(",0

15105,"i played this game about a year back (i stopped shortly after they released legs) and came back now to see what happened to the game in the meantime. for someone who really enjoyed how the game used to work, it's a big disappointment now. the removal of blocks with different durabilities might have been a defendable change, since some might argue that it turned the game into a bit of a grind, but replacing it with a system built on loot crates with random contents and weapons as different rarity drops makes no sense in this kind of game. the healing of damage dealt to your robot (at least in the gamemodes where you can actually find a game in a reasonable time) might be nice if it happens to you, but is utterly frustrating when a fast enemy just escapes from your view to return unharmed a few seconds later. for me the fun in the early stages of robocraft was in building a robot with multiple propulsion systems and failsafes to make sure i can still fight after taking damage, it was in batteling a crippeled enemy while trying to angle my weapon with my one remaining leg. of cause it takes away waiting time from the game, but the cost is a lot of what made robocraft unique.it seems like someone decided to take the regeneration of a modern shooter (without taking into account how little sense that makes for robots), the lootcrate system of overwatch (with the difference that the crates actually contain stuff that changes the gameplay, making it almost pay to win) and the slow progression of warframe (which is worse since the game is pvp not pve so the loadout actually matters).i can see how players like some of these changes and i can see how players that played a lot and dont mind to spend some money from time to time will still enjoy the game, but i would not pick it up as a new player, there are better fp games out there and i would not come back to it if you enjoyed it when it first started. i uninstalled it again; it's a shame, i really enjoyed the original robocraft.",0

13437,"i recommend this game insofar as the price is right - free. the visuals are pretty darn good for a voxel, minecraft type world. in terms of gameplay this starts off rather fun and interesting. a lot of biomes to explore and find. building is intuitive for the most part. the block rotation took a while to figure out and the method of spinning the blocks around is actually maddening. if they had made it so holding down r locks your hud and only spun the block instead of your character as well, this would've been a lot easier. beyond that, the game sorta falls flat after a few weeks because of limited building capabilities. one you get to the lowest levels of the map (corruption) and farm up a bunch of those materials and collect all the animals and things you want, there isn't much else to do but build. and that can be gratifying for a while. i enjoyed building little farms, collecting a bunch of animals and plant from different biomes, making a refillable refridgerator and lava producer, mob spawners and what not. bult some cool buildings and a boat and a bunch of other stuff, but after a while you hit a wall. the types of blocks are not even filled out - for example you can make chairs and tables with wood - stone - obsidian - iron - diamond - lumite - the full material progression. but then something like barred windows only goes up to stone... sorta weird. other things are like being able to make lumite walls but no stairs, roofs, or floors. so, making high end buildings that are unified in theme is basically impossible at this point. in addition, while this does have animal taming, block rotating, and a few other mechanics mine craft doesn't, it is dwarfed by minecraft's other content - there are no ai peeps, there is nothing like switches or rail tracks, etc. to give this game a lot of high end, end-game content to keep you building for years like the minecraft folks have. there are no end-game boss mods other than this one rockzilla thing you can spawn in. and unlike in other games, your tamed mobs become basically farm animals. nothing fights for you. no mounts. they kinda just sit around.anyway, fun to take for a spin, particularly if you never got into minecraft and this is your first foray into something like this. if it weren't free, i woulda probably said it was a waste of time and money.",1

2957,"yes, the game is really fun and addictive. at + hours i can say it is a true pay to win game. i do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money. there is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for xp so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ton of nickel and dimes. you will earn those same xp during each match, but at the rate of around to xp. it takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around skills (in tank battles). good luck earning xp by just playing. long story short, this game sucks for pvp because of pay to win. but is the best i have seen in a while for what i call eye candy (realistic looking models and fx) and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.ps. i would accept war thunder gold lion donations! lol",0

13825,"this game is now infested with corvettes which are supposed to be hit-and-run ships and general harrassers that tankier than the tanks of the game.this game is now infested with ramcans that disable entire teams in a single sweep with zero penalty to their obliviousness, amplified by the number of the same oblivious ramcans with zero penalty.this game is now infested with an absolute necessesity for a dictated meta loadouts if you want anything done, ever.save your time and energy elsewhere.---having been in this ride called dreadnought since its earliest alphas, a long running supporter of it, i can definetly, without a question say the game is nothing related to world of warships nor it has anything to do with muh moba.dreadnought is first and foremost a team based, role dependant third person shooter, that allows a great deal of hybridization of classes. this does not mean that the ship types deviate from their inteded fields, but that the available upgrades, modules and passives will enable every ship to perform hole plugging and support tasks in one way or another, without overreaching out of their respecitve roles.gameplay-wise the game does not offer anything ground breaking or revolutionary, but it repacks a good 'ole tps into goergous settings and lets you loose on awesome spacecrafts. general speed and pace is on the slow side, but that only adds to sheer mass these vessels possess.audiovisuals in general have lots of quirks every sci-fi fanatic appreciates. all the modules are animated and it's every time a pleasure to see broadsides firing, missile bays and batteries opening up and deploying the payloads or to see your ship recoil from the firing of high power catapults. not to mention your tactical- and weapons officers are constantly talking to you about target lock ons, module usage, shield status, you name it. really driving home the impression you are the captain.dreadnought is also one of those rare few free to play games where the advertised no ptw is actually true. nothing in the store offers you anything over your opponents beside a nice suit and a cap. one might argue hero ships fill this role, and maybe so given their income bonus, but then again, they all have god aweful locked loadouts it's not either worth using them, or then you need to know what you're doing. balances that bonus out.on the downsides of the game i'd say after tier the progression grind starts to become a chore as at that point the player has practically seen everything the game has to offer, only tougher matches in higher tiers against seasoned players after that. and that corvettes have most of the modules in the category absolute cancer.great third person team shooter with very little real problems, and nothing that is beyond repair or salvage, other than retainable player base. i myself have quit the game times now!",0
14941,"this is probably the most dissapointing game i've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. this includes overpowered weapons that shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, i could go on for hours.the largest problem i've encountered is players attaching a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. this mainly occurs with the new aeroflak cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.secondly the insane cost of items. so you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe money. now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. so, you play another match...but there's someone with an aeroflak, by the way did i mention that the aeroflak costs , to buy?but thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs , to buy, and i bet that leaves you wondering but how do i get that? well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending more money.anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.this has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? well other than costing a ton of money (a single day costs ) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. all of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?/ huge dissapointment",0

13066,"fallout shelter is a fp game that originally surfaced on mobile devices a few years ago shortly before the release of fallout . i remember completely failing at the task at hand and had my vault and its dwellers silenced forever due to a series of unfortunate events. i can only remember deathclaws and my poorly equipped bunch valiantly defending their incompetent overseer. recently the game was released on steam and i thought it best to try and redeem this overseer's tarnished record. the good news is that vault is flourishing nicely and has a lovely bunch of dwellers who either wander around taskless or work / days of the year doing what they know best... constantly turning a valve. i have to say that having had a fresh approach to the game, it is really accessible and it is refreshing not to have microfractions constantly pinging up asking you to spend more and more until your savings are non-existent. you can have it running in the background while you do some work or browse the latest news. yes, tasks can be repetitive and you do have to wait to reach quests(which is the interesting part). however i'm sure you have more important things to do rather than mindlessly click on tabs... if you get tired, you can buy a few mr handys to automatically collect resources. just be careful not to have them engage with raids or infestations as these lovely machines cost caps each to repair. it's a neat little management game and i would recommend you give it a go. just remember to keep those stimpaks and radaways stocked and you'll do just fine!",1

15277,"the game is terribly unfair and really picks its favorites. it always selects someone to be the lucky winner and another person to be the terribly sorry loser. i had played quite a few matches with friends and most of the time i was selected to be the loser (by the game, that is). no need to say i didn't enjoy that. it's not like i'm paranoid for thinking that - like my friends who were winning thought - it's totally the oposite, because when it was my friends' turn to be the loser, they started noticing a pattern too: some people simply have lucky rolls in this game for no reason and the same goes the other way. you don't roll physical d rendered dice, instead, you click a button and wait for the game to do its thing. i can't say i trust that. the rolls were so predictable, me and my friends started guessing the next rolls and we would mostly be right about it.its pretty much random how it selects people, i was just unfortunate enough to be selected several times. its rgn system is completely broken and who knows if that really was what the developers had in mind. if it was, i can say it was a terrible decision. it makes no sense to be like this. it's not fun as soon as you know you will lose. who'd want to play like that? (the developers, maybe)rgn aside, this game has some other flaws, such as the trouble that we must go through if we wanna play with friends. sometimes the steam chat invite doesn't work, some other times it does. some people can host rooms, some others can't (and like the winner/loser pick i just mentioned, it also changes between players). you are always designated one of the random colors (red, blue, green and yellow) at the beggining of each game and can't pick your own color (but can pick between different characters), which at first might not seem so bad, but when your game doesn't have a quick replay option in case you want to play again with the same settings, it gets mildly annoying to say the least. you'd have to leave the match you just finished just so you could create another one from scratch and invite your friends again. when that happens, you'll be assigned random colors again, which really messes up your brain when you want to identify your friends, based on the last match.this game is not very user friendly, but made me and some friends kill some time, but i still can't recommend. if you wanna get a good board game video game, get tabletop simulator. that's the definitive game in this category. go there and play some monopoly, whatever. it's not such a good game anyway...",0

12585,"because of assetto corsa, i was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so i thought i'd try it out. it turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. it's essentially the real racing of computers, except real racing allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent.let's talk about the game itself. the physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, real racing looks much better. especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best.is it a bad game? not necessarily, i'm guessing the game is merely developing, but i feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. definitely get assetto corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, i'd recommend trackmania nations forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of grid , which has online multiplayer.",0

3969,"team fortress is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with classes that all have unique personalities. each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.the heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. the soldier shoots rockets, has the nd most health and is the nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. the demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. the pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. the spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. his sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. the scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. snipers snipe from far away. medics heal and make people invincible at times. as for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. the more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. if a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. it is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. there is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points ( or points instead of just like king of the hill). teams for both modes are mostly vs . each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.the newest mode is mann vs machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. there is a free version of mann vs machine called boot camp and a non free version called mann up that costs a tour of duty ticket ($ in the store). the ticket gets used if you complete a mvm mission. if you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. a mann vs machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. what do you get for completing a tour? a random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!the maps in team fortress stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. there is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! hats for $, keys for $.. keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! there is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. the game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. weapons will make you a refined metal. that's the basic free currency of the game. when you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $.. you can also buy and sell keys in the steam market for steam wallet money to buy steam games.the items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. so it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. it is all rock-paper-scissors. heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. a pyro can easily take out a spy. stuff like that.team fortress is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and halloween events. the halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just halloween versions of normal maps. the community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. there have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.it is an exceptional game. diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!! free!!! you get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. it is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! or single player against bots! it is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. the game is smooth, the characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. there is a diverse array of modes.",1

17213,"free to pay!as much as i'd like to love this game (because i love the movies), i just can't. the game falls very short in my opinion for two main reasons. the first is that at times the controls can be frustratingly cumbersome, especially during flight. sometimes it takes a while to register a turn or boost, but maybe this is just due to timing.the second is that you're bombarded with advertisements for membership, additional perks and boosts, which i'm really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself. i don't mind a bit of advertising; these, however, are in your face, particularly on the loading screens, which i like to contain useful in-game information, such as hints or history.there's nothing wrong with micro-purchasing in a game. it's down to how well it's presented that counts and, unfortunately, it seems that a lot of the items or areas are unlockable only if you pay, thereby limiting the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore. while you can explore freely to an extent, it's pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next.one good thing about the game is that you can choose between solo and multiplayer, but after awhile it becomes samey and i quickly lost interest. sad because it has the potential to be a great game.",0

14395,"was the awesomenes construction simulator . that is what this game was. note that i'm a tier and have just recently played this game to update my review.i have built:m- mako from mass effect m- hammerhead from mass effect .ut-a kodiak from mass effect .terran diamondback from starcraft .terran are mercenary siege tank. (yes. the siege breaker from wings of liberty.)but none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being feet under, rewards being lowered with improvments to the system, and a plethora of other problems.back in early i strongly, i repeat, strongly supported this game. strongly, i emphasize this, say it with me. strongly... supported this game. but with every step forward, freejam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- clone warsso let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. this included the hoverblades, plasma launchers, railguns, and thrusters. from level upward of level . yes, this happened. freejam didn't change this until months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- double edged butt-erynow prior to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a repair function to the game, which put a drain on casual players tiers and up back then. what was the kick in the balls here? a % decrease in rewards. yes, both rp and tp (robopoints and techpoints).- hero zero next up was the hero system, which allowed you to get the full rp and tp from a match you died in if your team won, but wait! ...at the cost of the entire reward system getting another % decrease. at this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a % reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, it's been a massive pain in the - turn up for hatenow, next up, they remove repair cost, yet again, another freaking reward quantity decrease. you getting the pattern yet? don't worry i'll explain it in a second. at this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even more. - from intense to indensethis game was always a one-life team death match game. the respawned and overclocked update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused moba wannabe. even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named classic so far on the back burner it can take from minutes to hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. but here's the final blow to the old mode: a % decrease at this point... to the profit you make from it. classic is now as worthwhile as dumping yourin a toilet...or on a development team. think that's the worst part? oh no. i'm not even finished. - what is wrong with my ing keyboard!?!the controls with any movement design other than tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. as of the r&o update, wheels are incredibly sluggish, rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even one, aerofoils are a disaster to use, walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. and lastly, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.thisgenuinely brings my p!ss to a plasmatic boil. the challenge should not be in handicapping the ing player. - give us ur monies!why all the reward debuffs? because they want money. they want to force the playerbase to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. this game never did have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. and also, no, it's not even classified as pay to win. it's pay to ing progress. - give us ur monies !!the introduction of easy anti cheat, or eac. instead of using steam's vac system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. they decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. you see where this is going? yeah. they drove off a number of their player base stating, if you can't get into robocraft to play because of eac, that is a small price to pay for the issue of hackers trying to ruin our game. the only people who tried to help fix this was eac themselves as i recall, and even then, only under the pressure of the robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - give us ur ferkign muneez!!!eleven!why did eac have to fix it? because freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging asshles to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. but it doesn't even end there. they won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. not even an ounce. they won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. if they don't like your you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence any and all feedback that involves any kind of actual review with a vengeance. and hell, this hasn't even ended yet. keep reading. this is starting to look like the robocraft holocaust. *shudder* - nerf 'em to the gravenow, the final kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. finally, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of gun bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. i'll give an example. - from speedy to needyi made a vehicle called the masterkill b (frankly can't put the word itself in) which operated on two things: wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. as of days after the r&o update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a treaded tank, and that's with the thrusters on. i guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. without rockets, it's even slower than a tank. believe me, i've tested this one the day i learned of the horror inflicted on the physics engine, which i think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - final thoughtslastly, like i said, i strongly... strongly! supported this game! hell, i even put $ into this game just for hangar bays! but as of now? freejam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. this game had so much potential a year ago. but now it's all been dried up. freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. a year ago, i'd give this game a . out of . but as of now, i can only - in good conscience - give it a out of . a toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, all in the name, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. stay. away. from this hideous deformed child of a game. you will be stricken with it's gods-awful moba wannabe gameplay.[more on my review in the comments section]",0

1740,"to fully illustrate what makes dota one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.dota has its roots as a warcraft modification. warcraft introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of hero units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. this really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. to a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. it was a brilliant concept, and dota took it a step further.dota created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard rts format. it's one of the best examples of less is more than i've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game i've ever played.i've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your -man team is crucial to your victory. everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other -man team. there are very few cases of where a game can be winnable v, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. in the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. it's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than dota, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! it's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. this is what keeps me coming back, and i'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. if you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my youtube channel. thanks for reading!",1

14832,"wall of text inbound:great game. amazing game. i love this game to pieces. at least i used to. the game was awesome up until recently. than crates arrived. actually i shouldn't blame one update i suppose. if i were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, i'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf. this feature, which i'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. the crf allowed for the rapid deployment of op bots or rather exploitative builds. i'm going to use the tesseract as an example. while not a huge issue on its own, it is the way freejam went about resolving this issue that made matters worse. to any veteran of the game that had some knowledge of the problem, the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. a more complex fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. sadly, freejam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not ,but (now , but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. while the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. this isn't a review whining about badly balanced aa though, so onto the next nail. shortly after this fiasco, fj introduced epic loot. a system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins times out of . instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to test their luck with crates. crates that logically fail to reward a player. common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. this makes sense. the crates fj has forced upon us do not follow such logic. high tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. this is ing stupid, period. there's also the complaint regarding the premium row flaunting items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. moving on to the big one. a lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. if every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. as simple as this problem is, it is so bad in fj's case. the simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customers to vent. why? no devs will respond, with exception of drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :). the devs that have a proper power over the games development use twitter instead of their own forums. it's dumb. anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, i'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. so tl;dr:pros:. builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. . not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. cons:. devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised . balance weapons? what are those? . exploit/meta builds everywhere. creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to fj. . hope you enjoy gambling. ===i really like this game. but sadly, i can't recommend it to anyone because for . you're not rewarded for and the devs don't seem to intent on fixing the issues.",0

7250,"i usually dont play online card games because, in my opinion, card games like this seem to typically be based more on luck instead of skill, which i dont like, i also typically dont play online card games because a decent amount seem to be pay to win *cough* cough* hearthstone *cough* *cough* and sadly, this game seems to already be going down a pay to win path, its not as pay to win however, seeing as how getting money for card packs seems to be a lot easier than it is in hearthstone, but i am still somewhat dissapointed that despite the fact that this game is only about a month old, there are technically dlc's, the dark brotherhood cards and the heroes of skyrim dlc, the game gave me the alduin heroes of skyrim deck for free (i dont know why) and i played with it a bit, and the heroes of skyrim cards absolutely destroy core cards, which kinda upset me, i just hope it doesnt get to the point where everyone just uses skyrim cards just to avoid being crushed by other people with skyrim cards, because most of the core cards are very good, but only against other core cards, the only thing i can say i fully enjoyed from this game was the story, the story is difficult, but not too difficult, which i loved, and the rewards you get for playing it are amazing, overall, i have to say i dislike this game, but if you are a person who thinks they could get into it, i highy reccomend playing the campaign fully for all the nice bonuses, and also, dont spend your gold on core cards, but skyrim card packs with it, so you dont get crushed.",0

10954,"having played the game quite a while and many hours i'd say it is a fine free game. you can get far for free and earn the necessary gold to buy game modes (forge/draft) or boosters quickly.anyway, make sure to be quite zen playing, as there are a couple of points that can get very annoying and have you quit the game for a while.- there is no way to contril your power cards for your decks, they are always added automatically de facto by the number of cards of the factions you added. so several classic game builds are not really possible. doing a bi-color deck using % or more quick cheap spells of one color and boosting the rest with mighty cards of another faction? you'll never get the power needed to play the more expensive cards. you need to balance cheap/expensive cards within every faction.- starting the game you have one redraw. have a bad hand, no power or power only hand? think twice if you redraw if you have at least two colors you need in the starting hand. usually (with a high % chance) you'll find your redraw hand either one-color power stuck ( power max) with either only expensive cards or cards of another color. you need to be lucky to draw them before you are done and dead, what leads to the next point:- the ai seems to always draw what he needs. if he can't get through on the floor he will just start to draw a flyer each turn. you finally get a good creature out while he's empty handed? the kill-spell will follow the next turn, or at least a silence/stun - whatever suits better. you holding a spell killing a creature with attack or higher? the ai will play in a completely weird way (not acting like any player would with his cards on the field) to not have any creature higher than . example: x / critts giving him an advantage (card draw/boost/malus on my cards) and playing a / texting ''you may sacrifice another creature to give this unit +/+)... - some cards are not really balanced and overpowered. warcry and void interaction are very powerful, as creatures dying keep all there boosts, so for power you get them back to hand and boosted a further /. nice for a cheapo / or more for investing power :d also endurance is fine with the hourglass for power. all your creatures can't be stunned or exhausted, and attack/defend every turn...anyway it's a nice game and i like it, just needs some more balancing to harmonize the factions and maybe some of the game techniques and especially would really be fine to at least let the players set a % ratio for the power cards when building a deck.",1

10814,"i encourage everyone that is tired of hearthstone developer/balance/rng nonsense to try this gem. it may lack hs's flashiness (just a bit tho), but man it is deeper x times .tons of keywords including double attack, deadly, lifegain on hit, something happening once unit connects to face, spell protection and much more, also there is a void (where your dead or discarded cards go) and you can actually interact with it by either drawing or playing cards directly from the void if that is what your deck is about.there are no understated 'taunts' as any unit can block another one each turn, and you should actually think when to attack and when to hold, and also which unit to block to gain more advantage. there is no straight minion trading and the system favors the defender/blocker more, generally: if your unit attacked, it can't block on the next opponent's turn (unless it has special keyword), and multiple minions can block the same attacker, resulting in more favorable trade for defender. want to attack? think about it. and then think how exactly to attack, leading to...spells you can cast on your opponent's turn, that leads to more interactiveness. imagine you could kill annoying charge or whatever minion on your opponent's turn (if you saved mana(power) for the spell on your previous turn ofc). you can bait your foe to make unfavorable trades which he doesn't expect, counter spells of your choosing etc.as for the fp side, this game is so generous it's unbelievable after playing years of hs. there is single player mode where you can grind both gold and cards with just cards you get from tutorial campaign (and you build up your collection steadily and quite fast i must say). i've been playing eternal for like hours now and i have almost all commons and uncommons, most rares (epics) and legendaries (you can put up to four same ones in a deck), i payed in cash for just packs, everything else you get just for playing the game, and the better you play, the more you get. so in hours i opened over packs from which only were for cash. also you get crafting 'dust' just for opening the pack, and you can still dust your extras if needed.there are both solo and versus 'arenas', and you keep the cards you draft! and you can draft golden cards of any rarity too! this alone is almost worth the gold you pay, and if you win a few games, it gets even better. you get bronze, silver, gold and diamond chests for completing game activities and quests. these contain single cards ( common in bronze, uncommon in silver, rare in gold and random golden card in diamond) plus gold (up to packs worth of gold in chest), and golden+diamond chests yield card packs. also there is a chance that your chest upgrades on opening (bronze can go up to diamond!), this chance is about -%.card packs contain cards, including rare/legendary and i believe or uncommons. you get bronze chest for every ranked win, and every third chest is silver (these all can upgrade too!) low rng element and more overall control of what you do, for example you choose which minion to resurrect from your void, what card you force your opponent to discard (yes that's a thing). the only thing you don't control is drawing right cards, which can be frustrating since you need to build up your 'mana' through cards which take / of your decks. if you starve on power early on, you can't play your cards, if you are topdecking power cards when you desperately need something else, they are literally dead draws. and that can happen many times in a row, so i guess mild bad luck protection would be sweet. playstyle variety. man, there is a lot to play with: you can buff your top units of your decks into a huge monsters and overwhelm your opponent, you can go for removal/lifegain strategy, you can play with resurrecting dead/discarded cards etc, and since there are tons of keywords and actually a great amount of cards in vanilla set (over ), the combo potential is huge, and yes, these decks are viable, in fact, most of the powerful decks are built on sinergy and not on op card bombs (yet there are surely some of these cards present, but not to an extreme degree and devs are balancing stuff atm in the beta at least)visual effects and art style are decent. don't expect blizzard level, but if you put hs art and animations at say / this would be . or maybe even if they tweak some golden card animations, but they are not bad at all, just could be improved somewhere.overall i'm quite impressed, it feels like eternal took the best parts of other tcgs and blended it all in one place. this is a game many players wanted heathstone to be mechanic-wise and mtgo user/visually wise. it's complex, actually strategic, skill rewarding and extremely generous with fp rewards: just play the game and get tons of stuff!will definitely stay and play it for a long time,./",1

14333,"i've been playing this game on another platform in case anyone is wondering why i only have so few hours played.this is just my opinion on the game, the devs, and the situation based on my perspective as a player:after months of unsatisfaction and hope that things would get better, i have to warn people that this game is pretty much a scam.the game hasn't received a proper update in over a year. important bugs and ui issues still haven't been fixed, problems that make the game tedious, frustrating and boring haven't been addressed, no new features were added to make things interesting...meanwhile the devs did two things:) they promised content, fixes, updates, etc.) every month, they released packages at $ a piece that were way overpriced for what they did (even $ would be expensive, imo).people have been buying these time-limited packs because they thought improvements were coming soon. instead, the devs just made empty promises. they made polls on the forums to pretend that they wanted feedback, they published lists of stuff they were supposedly working on, they made excuses every week for unexplained delays, they blamed most of the situation on the community manager and replaced her by someone who just apologized more for delays... in other words, they did everything they could to save their reputation despite not actually doing anyting good for the game.a few weeks ago they also started to lock critical topics on the forum and they deleted old topics where they promised more content. it's kind of funny, i thought this would happen so i kept screenshots of these things... i guess i have enough experience with dishonest developers and their money-grabbing tactics to see these things coming.the worst they did is that they even banned one of their loudest critics and top players from the whole game for racism, for jokingly referring to the chinese company owners as our chinese overlords. as if it wasn't bad enough, from what i've been able to understand that comment was made in a private discord channel. the forums mysteriously became much less critical after that, everyone obviously started to worry about their game account getting banned for made-up reasons. long-time contributors to the community, who had special status on the forum acknowledging their efforts, also mysteriously lost that status after criticizing the game and became less vocal about their complaints.well, recently the devs anounced that they hadn't been working on any of the things they promised. instead, they had spent all their time making the game available in china. they said the promised fixes, improvements and additional content would come later, and they released more packs at $ a piece anyway.the thing is, i don't think any fixes, improvements or content are coming. they pretty much lied for months about working on this when it's now clear they weren't, so i think they don't plan to work on it at all, they're probably just trying to sell as many packs as possible until the game stops making enough money.so my advice: don't spend any money on this game. it's overpriced, the devs are lying about working on content, they censor criticism, and they try to hide the old promises they made. the content you can buy is overpriced, it will take you a very long time to use it due to broken game mechanics, and it's very unlikely that things will ever get better.it's one thing when devs make plans for new content, but then unexepected stuff happens and they can't finish the work. it happens. but in the case of shop heroes, it seems they never had any serious plans to begin with, despite saying otherwise. and that's not acceptable at all.you've been warned.",0

3818,"team fortress has been regularly updated since its inception in , after over nine years in development. due to all these updates, the game has actually taken on several incarnations. in other words, i will be individually reviewing the following three separate games:team fortress (-)hat fortress (-)dressup fortress (-present)but first,general:-you can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed.-scouts can fly by flapping their legs.-a can of soda turns you into the super-matrix; you can make bullets dodge you.-some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity.-coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer.-steel-toed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy.-whipping people makes them run faster.-a big russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an anti-tank missile as a russian t- tank can.-blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you.-flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker.-you can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey.-you can decapitate people with a golf club.-harmless explosives.-eating a sandvich will cure aids, mend katana wounds, and treat your erectile dysfunction.-hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it, upgrade it, and resupply it.-dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain.-a remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing.-you can shoot up morphine with a crossbow.-you can use a beam of light to turn someones exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor.-pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold.-urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher.-frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck. when they encounter australians with shields on their backs, theyll stab the shield first making the shield disintegrate.-a pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket, create a deceased doppelganger of you, all while you become invisible and walk away.-if you backstab someone with an icicle, theyll instantly transform into a highly-durable ice sculpture. team fortress (-)this was a team-based first person shooter involving two identical teams, differing only in color and artistic design, vying for control of various strategic locales around the world. you could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes. the various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team. however, this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were (and still are) generally foreign concepts. teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases, beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms, and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit. hats were just a cool side thing. many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat. overall, team fortress was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved.over out of , worth the weight.hat fortress (-)the mann-conomy update, released on september , , marked the end of team fortress and the birth of hat fortress . players no longer needed to idle to get hats. they could also buy them, trade for them, and even sell them for other hats. in addition, keys were also introduced, giving players the ability to throw away their parents or their own hard-earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats. more often than not, they ended up getting worthless virtual guns. the mann-conomy fever quickly swept over team fortress , reducing it to a side game. hat fortress was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the team fortress mini-game to show them off to others. the free-to-play update in further enlarged the player base, increasing the popularity of hat fortress , its modes, and related fun mini-games. as hat fortress was further refined and developed, new elements were added, including unusuals and non-hat cosmetic items. eventually, so many new cosmetics came in that hat fortress gradually evolved into another game. hats out of .dressup fortress (-present)this is the current and ultimate form of team fortress . the game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play. you can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes and/or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there. you can show off your outfits, topped off with exorbitant unusual hats, in a multitude of ways. you can do the conga, hi-five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits, play intense games of rock, paper, scissors, or play jack blacks guitar. you can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old team fortress . you could also play mann vs. machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become the man with the golden gun. if neither of those are satisfactory, there are a wide range of other mini-games to play, some of which have been around since the days of old team fortress . they include, but are not limited to: versus saxton hale, freak fortress , jailbreak, balloon race, tf kart, magic spells in halloween event maps, slender fortress, surf maps, jump maps, and tfware. in conclusion, dressup fortress does provide something for everyone, so i guess its alright./ iterations

6162,"this game is most likely the worst game i have ever played in my life. for the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game. then comes level . after level the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either pw f***, or just people who have played longer. if you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. your gun takes - hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend - seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? and if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are times worse. they camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. if you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. the player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. but, the game has to have tanks. you cant have a wwii war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. in assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish) let's move on to the economy. every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. you also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. any half decent gun costs $,+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. the game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but i have hours into the game and still have trash weapons. i'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so i can get better weapons. [edit ]: oops! silly me, i forgot about one of the most important things! you might be thinking okay, this game is in beta, it still has potential, right? well, this latest update made me think wrong. the soviet union was added as a faction (team) to the game. now, first of all, for the majority of the war the u.s. and the soviet union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. i dont. what i do care about is the fact that they made the soviet union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior; especially the ppd-. the ppd is a round mag smg. compared to the m grease gun and the mp, its totally op. the next smg you get is the ppsh. once again, round mag, upgradable to rpm (rounds per minute). shots at rpm = op. [edit ]: as you can see, my hours have raised since i wrote this review. now, this is not because i'm a hypocrite, its becuase my little brother hasn't realized that this game is not a good game, and everyday forces me to play with him. once he realizes, just like me, that this is not a good game, i will have no reason to play it.[edit ]: let's also talk about at (anti-tank). tanks in this game are completely unbalanced, especially in skirmish, but at least the developers were kind enough to give us infantry a way to kill tanks. mines, sticky grendes, and rocket launchers. for grenades and mines, you have to be right up near the tank, which is impossible to do if they are camping or have infantry guarding them. rocket launchers are a little bit better, but they take up so much inventory space you can only cary a sa-rifle or a ba-rifle, and you can barely sprint. the other thing is that the game doesn't want people destroying tanks, so they make the at weapons so overpriced they are literally unusable. sticky grenades are the best example. it takes sticky grenades to destroy a tank. the cost of using sticky grenades is credits. (average salary per game = - credits). you are paying a large chunk of your salary to destroy one tank, and the tank driver has to pay maybe -.[edit ]: one other thing. the game's matchmaking sometimes decides to match you in a game that is already almost over, meaning you will automatically be paid credits. if you are like me and your gun is very expensive to maintain, you are losing alot of money by playing.",0
2515,"this game can still be fun at times but doesn't really hold a candle to what it used to be.the devs are russian and very obviously favor the russian forces and have shown that update after update. tank battles used to be more balanced and less shot deaths but now it seems like anything under tier can get shot... from the front... / times. plane battles can still be fun but mechanics are wonky and i can't seem to get the controls to work right on a gamepad (don't have a desk atm). i played this a ton on the ps and tried the pc version and lost interest. its way more grindy than it used to be and can be ptw with crew upgrades and such. i wish i could upvote but i just can't. i like armored warfare for free to play tank games (not perfect but better than others. just don't give them money, they had a split with obsidian and it seems mygames or my.com or whatever are just trying to make a quick buck building a world of tanks clone. its still a solid game though) but i havent found a suitable plane replacement. the memories of a great free to play game are not enough for an up vote sadly.",0

8306,"this review is long and indepth. here is the short half in case you don't want to read: this game is absolute trash. this game is absolute trash. not like that wasn't to be expected though. this game was developed by cryptic afterall... and i couldn't be sadder about it. cryptic managed to purchase the rights to nwn from obsidian. (here's some food for thought: whose worse? cryptic for buying the rights to an damn good series, or obsidian for actually selling it to these shmucks?).where do i begin... i remember downloading this game for two reasons, and two reasons alone: one was so i could play with a friend (this didn't work out though), and two because i wanted the right to rip this game a new . so let's begin, shall we?now i want to begin by game play... ever played champions online? what about ddo? if you played both you're probably nodding your head. basically, cryptic took the play style from both games and smashed them together repeadtly. if you don't get what i'm talking about here's a good way to describe it: hit m a lot and use wasd. that's about it, you spam the button and then your character does stuff... yup. you get some abilities and you can press buttons and there is some skill trees like they have in champs but it's mostly like ddo.speaking of the champions online relationship... i must say cryptic, you gave me quite a laugh. one of the first missions of them game was to help soldiers that have fallen. the hilarious part is that they reused the same help! i'm a fallen soldier animationf rom champions online. you click a body the same type of interacting bar comes up just like in champions. now i know it's not fair to compare this game to bethesda games but let's take a look at fallout and elderscrolls. notice how yes they are indeed very similar and they run on the same engines... but they still put an effort to make a very different game. the animations are not the same, the skills are entirely different from one another, even the textures and models for characters are quite different despite the fact that they use the same face slider. they went out of their way to make a difference. these guys? hardly. i laughed even harder when i saw nwn icons reused for this game. the word effort is not in cryptics vocabulary clearly. i haven't played too much of it but it wouldn't suprised me if they blatantly reapplied stuff from their other games to this current. oh wait they already did. some of the hairstyles used from nwn are altered/make a direct reappearnce in this game. effort please?moving on from cryptics more than apparent lack of effort... the story is terrible and i hate all the characters. you will too. i don't have too much to say on them other than it's dumb, they sound dumb and i tried hard to ignore what they were saying after the first person spoke. yeah it's bad. i'm actually horribly bothered that this game thinks it has the right to be considerded a sequel to nwn, which was a mediocre game. championswinter nights: online is a game, to put it bluntly. you're better off not wasting your time with this. instead you should see if you can get a copy of neverwinter nights: diamond edition. one of the last few good games that bioware had ever made before neverwinter nights and bioware both got molested by bad companies. this game is a symbol of so much bad i could almost cry.-/someone please buy the rights to neverwinter nights from perfectworld/cryptic? you'd be doing a good series a much needed favor.",0

4416,"winning or losing is entirely determined by your connection error, or rather the server's connection which is so flimsy it could go either way. the game lags and has a lot of talking npcs and unncessary click steps yet has a timer. which means they must've intended the game not to be played as yugioh, but as a completely arbitrary gamble and the yugioh cards are there for aesthetic and to trick idiots into buying gems.overall it is more balanced than real yugioh, but that's because real yugioh is everything you should not do in a card game. with so much dependent on first hand cards, spells/traps only existing as complimentary utility, and a lot of power creep from set to set, it wasn't hard to make this game at all more competitive by just tightening the board and changing set rotation down to hand selected cards that aren't all that good in the real format. what this is, is yugioh where they only correct their own bad game design by limiting cards that broke the real game as either extraordinarily rare (again, to trick idiots) and leaving the meta complete hogwash because of consistency constraints and tight board management making a lot of archetypes obsolete.yugioh as a game is all about the rareity and power creep of a card, so in essence this fixes that by makingservers that run on a atari and insuring most players never even see the really broken stuff they've made over the years. but if you're expecting to duel hardcore, make friends, do really anything besides wait around for the server to crash and get a loss for it... you'll need to play another card game. which i can't even recommend to you one because the industry is just so unconcerned with improvement and actually in-depth gameplay they're all just as bad. if i could give it a rating instead of just a recommendation i'd rate it two stars because it's like some evil genie wish of technically fixing yugioh, but in the most contrived way possible. it's like these programmers work harder to aggravate and troll than they do making a game.",0

2501,"hello friend, as a player who has put over hours into this game over the course of more than five years, and being among the most qualified players on the whole of the steam platform to review this game, i can unequivocally tell you, do not involve yourself in war thunder. do not pay money into this game. what follows, in no particular order, is a list of grievances: the development of this game has been like a car crash in slow motion. wt includes pay to win elements, gambling mechanics aimed at children, russian nationalism, loot boxes, and one of the most degenerate and coercive free to play economies that has ever been implemented in a video game. the game is fundamentally flawed in terms of vehicle balance and matchmaking is a disaster. queue times for end game content go on for upwards of minutes for matches that are essentially vacant; six player teams. datamining has revealed evidence that russian vehicles in the game were equipped with hidden modifiers that increased their survivability. the grind is hollow and unrewarding even when you pay for a premium membership/ vehicle. the wt community is toxic in a way that makes cod and lol look like dolphin swim adventure. these people hate each other and everything around them. behaviors include racisim, misogyny, homophobia, etc., with rampant teamkilling, mission sabotage, and hate messaging. gaijin's community management/ public relations is a dumpster fire and everyone i know dislikes them personally. the moderators of the war thunder forums employ a draconian form of censorship that silences and disappears crticism of the game, while punishing the forums authors with user bans. bugs and historical inaccuracies in the game remain present over the course of years, and are ignored by the developers even when historical documents are provided for them. the developers are drowning the game in new currencies and markets. events in wt now revolve around a counterfeit marketplace where the event itself is no longer designed to be fun or entertaining, but with the goal of pressuring the player to pay into the marketplace in order to unlock game content. wt employs a round robin system of rebalancing which artificially and ahistorically changes the behavior of vehicle ammunition, armor, etc. in order to influence the style of play. the developers use this technique in order to force players to grind through game content, rather than simply allowing them to play where they feel most comfortable. this is not an exhaustive list.all my love and affection,- kwkp.s. free parts and fpe!",0

7038,well hours in game i can say that its fun but hella annoying n more or less all have to do with luck u can make good decks but still wont help u win if u get draws but still fun the dark brotherhood maps good n worth the gold each but dont spend real money its not worth it lol. in periods game wont load until u try many times n game can be unstable at times. u can pay to win but ive not spent any money on game but still got all the db maps and madhouse collection missing a couple decks so if u are pantient its not that hard to get. the seasonal reward cards are good but think its dumb u can forge them before theyre given as reward. kinda kills the fun. some cards too op n if u meet an opponant with too many of these u have no chance. id recomend it unless u get your day ed if u lose too much cause expect that to happen in periods n u will notice that the resistance from opponants differ very from what time a day u game but that goes for most games xd,1

15964,"scroll past the edits for the actual review!important note: played approx hours. currently at lv and have the basic guardian package (one-time payment - not required!). update : almost level (current max level). i will extend or re-write this review when they release the full game sometime this year (). looking at the game plan i'm / on some of the features like dragon crystals from watching ads - [aqd website] aqd game-plan. which is a hard pass, but i'll grit my teeth if limited only to mobile and tablet - so no pc!.-->the edits<-- | edit : missed spelling and grammar corrections. credit to grammarly also (what i used before posting). if i get names or anything wrong please forgive me. edit : made the s in dragon lord's [space between dragon and lord] name the actual numbers (requested). edit : removed a space (should be last edit, sorry).___overview:the game itself is a grind, not so much like maplestory (d free to play sidescroller), but you do notice it. most of the game, as far as i can see (for now), can be played without spending a penny. gear can be bought with gold or grinded for. some gear can only be grinded for and cannot be bought with gold or dragon coins (real money). when crafting gear you can either wait the allotted time or speed it up with dragon coins; similar to crafting systems in games like warframe. however, this is never needed and if you have the patience can by waiting - doing other things like grinding levels, resources etc. story:the story is minimal and kinda lacklustre but it is there. there is no voice acting but the music isn't half bad. it doesn't really pick up until after doomwood; which is the dragonslayer questline in ashfall. it may be because i am a higher level, or that it's faster paced, or a combination of it all. but that's how it feels for me right now.optimisation:i run on a crappy laptop and for the most part, the game is easy running. which is always a plus for me. it's no eye candy (thank the heavens), but it isn't half bad. i was born in the 's though.side notes:there is no mini-map or world map in the game. the abilities are really simple, others suggesting a skill tree (even a simple one would do). most paid items are cosmetic it seems, but alternative potions to the gold bought varients are paid (including some paid only potions) like xp and faster gold potions. also - yes, i have bought roughly two so far. why, because xp is so minimal in this game. i know the cap is (with being the max allegedly). but please, make it a little more than what it is. although, can't really complain as i don't mind in the grand scheme of things.notes on story:apart from it needing a hell of a lot more content and features. the story needing additions like voice acting, choices and cinematic cutscenes maybe.final say:there is a whole lot more i could say, but check discussions; as lots of people have talked about and suggested much more than what i have here. credit to all the ones i read, and to dragon lord. if you can put up with the minimal gameplay and story (which for now i hope is only due to early access). then i recommend this game. or, wait for full release. also, please only have microtransactions cosmetic only. because, the day that this becomes pw (pay-to-win) - i will quit this game. regardless of my time invested. credit and extra:take care everyone, and i hope this helped. again, credit to everyone in the game who has mentioned stuff, people in the discussions thread (on steam) and dragonlord.",1

12333,"edit: so i gave this game more time than most and played with friends and old guild members hoping the game would become what it was striving for. at the current moment i don't believe anytime soon it'll get near that point but i was never hyped about the game to start with, i knew about it prior to it's release in kr, ru, and jp and the tab-targeting really put me off but my friends were excited so i gave it over hrs! had an issue with quest items being locked to my inventory on may st, replied to it on june rd because no one answered my pleas for help, and then on june th i was told my issue was too old and newer requests for help were more important so i would need to resubmit my issue to have it resolved.at least with ark and conan exiles i have an excuse for keeping them despite them being in ea for so long, i cannot do that with bless.===like any early access game there is a lack of content, features, the server stability and optimization is also something i expected with my yrs+ of mmo launches for various games (tera, swtor, gw, archeage, blade and soul, black desert online, and more).so far i am enjoying the game even though i looked past it once i realized back in it was marketed as tab-target, however that has changed in the years it's been released in other regions with the action combat camera choice that is currently only available to berserkers (but will be available to all classes soon).the gameplay is something to get use to like with any other newly ported na/eu release from overseas, but i'm enjoying myself and learning how to play various classes, berserker, ranger, and mage so far, and hope to play mystic, assassin, and warlock once those are released! the combo system is automated so you have a starter skill then the option to combo skill on top of that (these skills aren't available unless you use a certain starter skill) which are keybind by default to r,t,y. you continue the combo twice using the same intial key (ex. > r > r or > t > t or > y > y), some skills with have a bouncing down arrow on them to indiciate that they can be charged and the charge available for these attacks are shown as bubbles above the skill icon - so far i've seen a max of two complete charges that can be performed on a skill.the map looks pretty cool but difficult to navigate when you're trying to follow a quest that's directing you to a new city. there are three ways of travel that i've discovered so far: wyvern (air), gondola (waterway), and airship (air), each cost a fee that can be decreased with the games premium subscription at which it is decreased by % (only wyvern fees are decreased by premium).so far with the game i have not claimed my days premium as i do not feel hindered without it, mainly i feel this way because of the games i've listed above have had similar payment models (some even starting as pp and turning into fp w/subscription option) and i've opted out of purchasing the subscriptions offered (if offered) as it had no impact on my personal gameplay and being current with pvp (while not exactly being in the top tier) was not difficult to obtain or maintain during my days within those games. was it difficult? not really but it would've been easier and more profitable if i had them but that is personal perspective as well as whether or not you consider yourself a hardcore player in the top % and feeling a need to acquire an advantages available to you.i will be testing the premium when the game has concluded it's day headstart and will update with more information about the game as i progress through levels, zones, and professions!",0

2812,"i have sunk over at least a hundred hours on the steam and non steam one, if you come in expecting an easy life with smooth grinding , your name painted on the scoreboards as the mvp then you might as well go back to ace combat. ill narrow it down for you, you will die and not typically die as in a heroic last man standing death, no you will and i mean will be one shot. pros -the game is very well optimised so even with my bad ping of as long as the packet loss is low you can frag -war thunder did a good job at keeping realism to a point where it is realistic but not overly till the point you cant have fun-it isnt pay to win as you think, the premium currency can buy you vehicles but usually they are the same as the ones you can grind and unlock with the in game currency, the difference is they give you more exprience or currency gain -every tank has a weakness , if you think the big tiger was a threat wait till you see it get one shot by an m then you will change your mind. -new vehicles added in presents a challenge for new players expecially in learning on the basics, i really only used my rudder, flaps and etc like a few months into the game and once you do learn you can surpass thousand hour players-nothing is overpowered as i said before, every tank, plane and soon ships will have a heel to step on lets say the russians, in the most common tier league we have the medium t , pretty strong from the front , good armour and a strong gun anddd its gone why? the ammo is located around the middle of the tank literally surrounding the crewmen next up is the sherman, strong frontal armor the best in its medium tank class , but its side armor is relatively thin and oddly enough the armor plate surrounding the armor bulges out and is weaker than the hull itself huh so yes every tank has an exploit for you to find , memorise where they are and you will be one of the strongest players in the game -over the years it had begun so much , ive been around before the ground forces and i havent sunk a single dollar into this game (im poor shut up) and im still actively grinding so yes the replayability is high with this game -this game will look good even on low unless you are one of the pc master race that owns an i -fp , for a constantly updating game cons - one shots (you and the enemy can do that to eachother you arent op ) - anti social community , on servers i have been there is little to no talking in text mostly just people complaning about they got hit or they died from a weird angle - teleporting back to where you were to receive a shell -team members may or may not assist you and maybe push you off a cliff either by accident or on purpose ill never know - the grind , its a grinding game which is easy for the first few tiers then you slowly think about buying golden eagles to fund your research because you have been playing the same tank for a few weeks already and you are still so far from getting the next tank in line and then probably when you do you have no cash for it so you grind for cash and the button to purchase it is tempting you -its file space is large so if you are going to need a lot of space for this baby notes play with a friend and get a discord going or something , playing with friends is good as you can watch your backs and increase the survival chance of you and allies, the community is funny sometimes so it will cause a laugh or two sometimes during an serious confrontation, there will be badass moments when you are alone and you can score one shots in a row , or clutch the round with a lucky bomb drop from your aircraft either way, this game requires skill and a little bit of luck on your side recommend yes , this is probably the best free to play to get not many other can compare so i nominate it for the test of time award and /",1

12075,"this game is so sloppy. that's the best word i can think of for it.takes forever to start up and closes on connection error. horrible.has the profoundly stupid choose a faction and one of the mostly-faction-unique races that are also highly restricted in class choice system. please remove this from all future mmos forever.after the (clumsy and rushed) tutorial, any keys you rebound will revert and you will lose the skill line the tutorial had you equip, without any indication that anything changed until you suddenly notice.the framerate is atrocious and takes massive drops in certain areas for no clear reason. this affects your ability to type coherently.the combat system is roundabout and unintuitive to absolutely zero benefit other than just to be different. half of your skill bar is constant (non-chaining) and the other half is dynamic (chaining). you can equip two chaining skill lines and swap them. each hotkey on the active chaining line is actually a combo starter that you continue with r. it's a cool idea but implemented atrociously.all of the characters are, shall we say, impaired - not only is the full voice acting very awkward and misses the proper intonation of basically every single sentence, but the sentences themselves are written in a strange, non-conversational, whimsical grammar stew that is confusing and baffling. this has the effect of making the entire game story a confusing, surreal fever dream.the auto-path does not account in any way for dynamic terrain, so your character will happily walk off of moving platforms and ruin the autopath completely.certain quests don't tell you what you're supposed to do. for instance, i just took an airship as part of a quest, with no indication of where to go on the airship. i had to hunt on the map and compare the quest's details to figure out the correct destination. i then had to wait like five minutes for the airship to physically travel there in real time (and with loading screens).",0

12047,"i have almost hrs in. while the revoews are mostly negative, these are from people who expect a perfect mmo release. that is not a realistic hope. the game does have some issues(stuck at loading screen), these issues have work arounds and are actively being looked into, there is some performance issues some people claim to have. i did not expierence them. but for people that are, you can tweak config file to improve them. this has almost become standard with alot of mmo releases. i have found a few spots in the game where the translation was not carried over correctly. these can make trying to understand the quest hard, but its also a port from another lanquage and that can cause alot of issues and somethings dont always translate over correctly. but, even with those issues the game is still really gorgious world around you. the gameplay so far i have really enjoyed. and the storyline even with its issues still does intice me to listen. the pvp is fun, the dungeons are fun as well. and the questing i enjoyed(which i normally hate with a passion), so for $ its worth the money.. its been awhile since a game has caught my attention for more than a day or so. i have played wow-yrs, aoc-yr,eq & eq- +yrs, eso months, bdo days. with a open mind i look forward to playing this game and seeing what changes they come up with.",1

15675,"note: this is a review on the steam version of the game and how i feel the game from a pc perspective and not a mobile perspective. there is no difference from the steam version and the mobile version but there are some things that look good on a phone or tablet but not so much on the pc. if this was a review on the mobile version then i would definitetly recommend this game.now as the game is still open beta, there are many things to be added and polished on (like levels, maps, shops etc) so i can't talk about the lack of content but instead i will mention the things that i feel are weird in the pc or things that should be added or modified.the ui - it shouldn't come to a suprise that when you make a cross platform game between pc and mobile, there are gonna have to be corners cut. in this case its the ui. on mobile, the ui looks great and makes sense but on the pc, it just looks cheap and unclean. preferably if possible, adding an option to switch between tablet ui and pc ui would be amazing. the ui also lacks alot of small yet needed details like specific hp, mp, and xp numbers.friends/party system - while there is an friends list system, there is no party system. you can use the summon code (which is a bit buggy at times. i was stuck in loading) to play on the same channel/map but there isn't a real party system. so you can't see their hp/mp bar without clicking on them. this may not be as big as a problem now but in the future when there are healer classes, it would be extremely difficult to play as you can't attack a monster while keeping tabs on your friends hp at the same time.weapons/classes/stats - there are main stats in the game; hp, mp, attack, and defense. the class you have on only affect your skills and nothing else. daggers gives the most attack of all the weapons, staffs give the most mp, and swords give the most defense. here's the problem. all the classes are equally tanky. i have played all the classes besides guardian and i have noticed little to no difference in survivability. being tanky isn't going to help when you're playing a rogue or mage because that's not what they do, and warriors are suppose to be tanky, but do a bad job at it because there are no skills to help him be tanky. in fact, i would say mage and rogue are more tanky because they have defensive skills (mana sheild and stealth). this makes attack the most valuable stat for doing the most damage. aqw was really customizable because there was no restriction on what weapon you could use. you could be a mage and use a hammer, but this only worked because every weapons attack stats were the same and the attack stats are mainly determined by the enchant. in aqd, each weapon has different stats. attack determines how much damage you do, and that's the only real stat you should be going for as rogue or mage. even warriors should build this over defense tbh. daggers have the highest attack making the daggers the only viable weapon to use for high dps. this takes away a lot of customization (plus it looks weird for a mage to use a dagger as a weapon). some solutions to this would be adding more stats (like luk for rogues and int for mages) or making it like aqw where all weapons have equal damage and the stat's are based off enchants.again, this game is still in beta so it is expected to be some flaws but there is a lot of potential in this game. with some things added and polished, i can see this being a very fun game",0
8839,"the devs are trying too hard to please everyone.at the time of this review, an update removed a set way to get legendary class weapon by first getting a kill and then crafting said weapon. how do you get them now? well by sheer luck of course. any chest has a chance to drop a class weapon, which means you can get one seconds into a match or never.this made me quit the game because i dont like rng based gameplay.hopefully something is done about this, until then, goodbye.",0

(. . .) and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down point of br which is ing broken most of the time. i'd like to see tanks around my level or one above/below mine. instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are whole br above you, meaning your best tank is worthless. if your best tank is worthless, all the ones below it are useless. the second i researched a tank past . (.) i immediately saw an insane rise in my br (battle rating) versus everyone else. once in a blue moon i can penetrate the tanks i find, otherwise i am either getting ed by enemy armor or my own team not defending a point. i went from getting - kills a match to getting maybe or . sometimes .this is not a matter of skill because i can outflank the enemy team like a ing mythical norse god and still be useless because i put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank, while this guys brigade of super heavy . tanks turn around andall over me. i cant count the number of times i've seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map, mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through ing trees.arcade is ing useless, it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by . if there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank, you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game. the second your name pops up tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn heat shell with the accuracy gungnir. if you even attempt realistic without hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier. if you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every ing aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you, robbing you any chance of having fun.so they almost have a good game here. but they wont fix the dice rolling, they wont fix thematchmaking range, they wont fixto make a good game. i dont mind the grind at all (which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers). they wont because it heavily insentivizes people to get premium and buy their way through the grind, in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their mm wand. it is such an incredibly fustrating and unrewarding experience once they've roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that / game is not worth it. i rarely got matched with high br until i really got into the game. dont even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single ing stray bullet.i would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging they've got going on.edit: tanks (and aircraft) are also seperated in ranks. these ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about .-. in br; although the ranges vary based on the nations you play. my point being is % of the tanks in france rank are unplayable and i am not exaggerating in the slightest. to compare, the worst i did with a tank in rank (germany/usa) in war thunder was something like spawns and kills. i never had more deaths than kills in war thunder until i tried the french. the french are so bad i had a tank with spawns and kills. another tank with spawns and kills. one tank with spawns and kill. the only time i could get kills was pure and absolute luck with finishing off someone elses target while i hit weak spots in the back, which sometimes took many shells. or shooting a notoriously terribly armored tank (bt-). it was baffling how these tanks were incapable of penetrating even the worst of tanks. non of the starting tanks would yield their sweet death to me, including the japanese. even when i managed to penetrate, the amount of time it took me to lob - shells into a single tank, only gave teamates enough time to finish them off just because you couldnt finish off their crew. i'm sure if you google french rank tanks you will see everyone agrees.",0

2800,"war thunder is probably my most favoritve game on pc, and i have invested nearly five hundreds hours into this game. it's graphics are sublime, maps are large and if you can get a squad together it's some of the most fun you and your friends can have. but there is a major problem, the grind. and the grind is terrible, making me stop playing for two months until the latest update whick piked my intrest. grinding for new parts and vehicles at the low tiers is easy and relatively fun (even though for some strange reason ,ie microtransactions, essential parts like fire supression are not stock. making tank battles impossible to come out alive) at later levels it slow's down to a crawl. making it a huge headache to keep moving up.but there is a way around this, microtransactions! making the game almost laughably easy if you're wallet is deep enough. those who don't fork over the cash either spend hours grinding a single vehicles to not die in seconds, or get stomped by everyone else. it's irritating and demoralising to see people who have invested less than twenty hours be at tier four with everything fully upgraded. i've spent the last thirty minutes looking at my bank account debating to finally give in and fork over some cash.long story short, the game is fun at lower levels. basically anything past tier two becomes a grind unless you fork over cash.",0

2421,"go big or go home.poe is, at its core, all about rng. rng loot drops are the core game mechanic. as one person put it fighting loot, finding monsters. the game has plenty to recommend it: great graphics, inspiring sound & music, a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character builds is nearly endless, great customisation and the best mtx system i've yet seen in a game where % of all items that can be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic in nature. the other % are quality of life items that do not in any way make poe pay to win. this is how all game companies should do microtransactions.my problem with poe is that the nature of the rng systems means that actually useful items are *incredibly* rare. the entire game economy appears to be designed with the % twitch broadcasters in mind who play thousands of hours of poe & nothing else. that's fine, but it essentially locks an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty walls that can only be breached by spending huge amounts of time playing. if like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff, work, family etc then i would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere. my ~ hours (at the time of writing) have been accumulated over the past years.if you're willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibilities that poe offers, and the deep meta game are very rewarding and for these players poe is the best arpg available. if however you have limited gaming time or play casually then don't bother, you're not the target audience for this game unfortunately.would i recommend poe? yes, but only because i enjoy playing with my friends. this is not a game that i play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the best gear is frankly unbelievably boring.",1

12900,"i get why people don't like it for the most part. it really is a mobile game because of the waiting and it isn't a click-fest so people aren't enjoying it because instead of watching resources build infinitely while they click like monkeys having seizures located primarily in their fingers, it's a slower-paced game where resources build over time. i see people whining about having their money stolen, although that would mean the game is taking money from them without their permission which is just a lie. you don't get anything stolen, you choose to pay for items in a fp game on steam. i'm not sure why these people are lashing out at someone else for something they clearly chose to do, but in either case it's just a lie. i don't care if purchases don't carry over to a new vault (how many do you need, did you screw up that badly, that many times?) especially for a game that doesn't need *any* item to actually be bought in the first place. you wanna toss a tip to the devs and buy a box or pet or bot? ok, it's your money to toss. but don't buy something then turn around and scream they stole your money. it's pathetic.graphics are fine, it's a pretty fun game to play while drinking a cup of coffee and reading something or watching a video on the side. sing & fantastic beasts just came out, i'd suggest either of those i think they were very good.good game, good resource management means you need to do some actual thinking, or you could buy something to make it a little easier. or you could do the daily quest things and get caps & boxes for free like most people.",1

16269,"very fun and truly educational game. when it says full disassembly it really means it. it does have a field strip as well, but on top of that it has a full factory service type of disassembly/reassembly wherer you have to get every single little pin/spring out.its a tough game, and as a person who has owned and repaired several of the firearms in this game, i can say that it is a very accurate and educational tool. this would be so helpful for a gun owner doing repairs, whos having a hard time seeing how a certain assembly goes. its not with out its problems, there are some order of operation- type issues that dont always make sense, sometimes it requiers that one gun part comes off before the other, when in real life that is not really how it would be. but im sure theyre probably following like the service manual order when it comes to those things, so its no real error i suppose.great game, get it, i highly reccomend the starter pack dlc< not the full lifetime dlc. its on sale right now for bucks, it gives you guns that are all unlocked and ready for dis/assembly challenges etc. the full mode unlocks everything, and thats not as fun, if you are goal oriented gamer, it will pretty much finish the game for you.",1

13261,"i'm torn on this game. on the one hand: the combat is enjoyable, the graphics are charming, there are a ton of different game modes, both pve and pvp are fun, there's a clear sense of progression, and the payment model feels pretty fair.on the other hand: monster balance is pretty much nonexistent. there are a ton of monsters to collect, but most of them are useless and there are a handful that are so good that you're going to see them in every pvp game. and if you're unlucky and happen to not get the overpowered monsters that everyone is using, you're basically stuck until you get lucky or spend a bunch of real money gambling on chests.but in the end it's more fun than frustrating, as long as you accept that pvp is just as much about being lucky with getting the right monsters as it is about skill.",1

6343,"don't care about the playing time. i usually launch non-steam version excepting payment.this review is written in japanese and english. sorry about my poor english. fpsall what i'd like to say is us weapons of fresh soldiers are stronger than german ones in this game. of course, german weapon can be strong in the end. german players must be patient. until your trooper trained enough, you will be killed so many times even if you are experienced in first-person shooter. don't worry about the kill-death ratio. in this game, tankers usually make kill-death score or more. anyway, if you want to play on axis side, please remember these disadvantages as follows.gmmpmmlv upmp(mgt)mfirst, us infantry equipments are superior than german's ones. the damage and recoil of g rifle(german beginning rifle) are inferior than m garand(american). if you want to keep using this rifle for long time, you should improve these status by installing weapon mods. after that, this rifle will be able to defeat uncle sam with only twice body-hits in close to middle range. mp submachine gun has only rounds while m greese gun has rounds. this gap suffer german players. of course, you can purchase mp submachine gun when you earn enough exps of smg ribbon.however, its fire power and rate of fire is still worse than m thompson. in addition, the biggest problem is ... mp is so expensive. its price is higher than mg and even light tanks !!ww()mmapcrma.mm.mmtmsecondly, the difference of the quality of tanks is serious. excepting russian, most people may believe german tanks are best in ww !!. although it might be true, in this game, german tank soldiers must walk thorny path. pz.i light tank(german beginning tank) is the worst tank, and it will be just a coffin in tank battle.this tank bring only a pair of .mm machine gun while american ma lt has .mm machine gun. for example, however when you shoot apcr(better penetration and more expensive ammo) against the back armor of m stuart or m chaffee, it can never penetrate(shoot out) their armor, even they are light tanks!! in case, against m sherman or m persing? needless to answer... so, if you want to train german tanker, i recommand you to avoid tank battle with pz.i. attack only enemy infantry and non-armored vehicles, and gain exps of light tank ribbon to buy t tank. it is the best light tank in german, and it can kill american light tank from its front. german heavy tanks are actually good, but there are only a few opportunity to cast them in standard battle.skirmishlike this, german player will fight under disadvantages. but, after getting well-trained soldier and purchase enough weapons, you will feel this game fun. while you are new player, you should join only skirmish battle, and earn exps and credits. skirmish mode battle takes less time thans assault mode battle.mred orchestrafinally, i need to tell an important thing to both us and german new players. the fresh soldier has no anti-tank weapons, and they cannot buy them yet. your anti-human grenades cause quite no damage against armor targets. it means, you can easily be slaughtered by even pz.i light tank!! and, compared with red orchestra series, the damage of anti-tank weapons is weaker and weaker. for exapmle. you will need direct hit of panzerfaust to kill m hellcat(even this tank-destroyer has only ~mm of armor). if you use anti-tank grenade(this is so risky), it also needs twice or more. using panzerschreck or ma bazooka is more damage than panzeraust, and much safer than anti-tank grenade. but their prices are so expensive. after consuming all rounds, you need to supply them at the same prices of buying new ones. as the result, when you get suffered by enemy tanks and you want to eliminate them, you should cast a tank, like enemy does.",1

8099,"an mmo with a great active combat system, lengthy and robust progression, rich lore from the grandaddy of rpgs itself! sounds good right? well yes, this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive.so where does it go wrong? honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole, now being an mmo errors and problems will surely show up from time to time, i mean they're called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldn't expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems. examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to one-hit-kill endgame bosses, attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers (which allows them not to be hurt) or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few.along side the numerous comabt exploits are those have allowed players to gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited. the exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to, some are still present. next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to mmos but the path that these developers take with them is, which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so.last but not least is the fp model that they use which before module i didn't really have a huge problem with, whilst i did spend more than enough money on this game pre-module it was more of a luxury than a necessity. now with what i have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement pay to win feels like it has made it's way here. when all is said and done i did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new mmo as in it's current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money. instead what i would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an xbox one is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and it's community whereas the pc staff seem to barely listen to their playerbase on the whole.",0

11940,"i'll echo what many others are saying. no, just no. i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an mmo. but given that bless has been an ongoing project since and released in regions prior to steam. there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years. trust me, save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first. ~million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west...promotion/marketing- they advertised this game as local, optimized and new combat mechanism. upon -days early (of early) release this is not the case by a long shot. they marketed to your hype and released none of it. matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas. i get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better. optimzation is just not there...you have to edit your own ini files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine /dx...yeah, a dinosaur. new combat! after many complained about the new combat beign removed (except for zerkers) to polish it more...this...this is not beign transparent after happily stealing dlc money. to make it clear, if they said it in advance, many wouldve been ok in waiting. emmisary event-was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release. emmisaries were youtubers to try/represent or even help hype the game. many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs. apparently some drama went down with them too. needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status. early day launch- needless to say that it was a waste of time. one thing is to wait in queue, another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line-to-wait. which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option. that's ish issues. as of this post, its still iffy, believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation. collectors edition-skin/items are all character bound. no way to move them, no way to given them to an alt. with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join, good luck. your pack just got wasted. am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason. also the lumena in-game currency was character bound, they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more. problem here is, they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt...see a trend? in game they warn you its non-refundable! yeah right, people got their money back. nice try.servers- they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time. am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen. so while opening new ones are nice, it splits up pre-made guilds and your precious already burned founders items. poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here. planning of only server vs oceanic, south america, north america, carribean...get the point?roadmap- they have a vague one laid out. most of it is the same from the other regions. but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time. therefore many of earlier region content was striped away. here's the thing, when you meet a person and give that first handshake, that first introduction, it says alot about who you are. neowiz...who are you becoming? neowiz-overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work. do you know what they did differently? open forums, discussions, podcasts, whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with...transparency. warframe and ff are to name a few here. you have been hearing feedback, yes, but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you. come out of that closet, face us more often and get that feedback and just talk...talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship. also, lets say your afraid, you dont want to face an audience, then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with.in short, i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you (neowiz) make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention. at that point, what happens to you?should you prove to turn this around and do better, then ill update my review. just no until then, moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a non-refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried.original post may th.edit and follow up /hmmm where to start. i still would'nt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone. make your own informed decision for what $-$ is worth to you. soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the game's release. from there a few patches, that as i mentioned above, catered to whomever yells the loudest. some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf. not to mention that each patch note doesnt include full disclosure still. for example, first two dungeons used to drop gear, guaranteed, each boss. now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have rng of a drop rate for rng of it beign of your class. events! boy are they throwing events left and right. the last gather/crafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or alt-bank. content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible. i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised. dx was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it. further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above. dupe items scandal. it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed. it demonstrates a rolled back build, further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content. not a full rework. ff went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell. as for those involved in the duping, few days ban and items were kept. so they say. apparently they are listening to feeback through their discord and with some emissaries. i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways. performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within weeks. perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions. performance, performance, ~ million later, perfomance...they already stole your money (and mine) with lack of transparency. whats a few please wait, more soon to make you more gullible?sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience (twitter, reddit). the fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could -shot things. now that adjustments make sense, no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo/links system works. its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down, read, practice. but they seem addicted to preference already.latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition. they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound. this on its own is unnecessary to founders. gold is account bound and am willing to bet that's an issue on the code, unintended. yet the in-game dollar-currency, lumina is not.",0

2133,"i plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoa % free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. it's like diablo but darker and a more grittier feel. story- you are exiled and left in a continent or place called wraeclast. you venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in wraeclast.gameplay- you select various classes: maurauder (melee/tank), duelist (hybrid of melee/range), ranger (archer), witch (mage), templar (hybrid), and a scion (unlock after st act). so there is a character for just about any play-style. destroy the many hordes of creatures in wraeclast to gain experience and level up. you get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. you get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. and poe boasts a massive skill tree that i have ever seen in games. the skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. online/co-op- there is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. there are guilds to join. you can trade some of your gear with other players. there's also pvp, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. cons- minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. you think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. it can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. but it's a minor gripe.conclusion: if you like diablo games, give this a try. game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. there's plenty to do. the game today is completely different from when it was first available. most importantly, the game is free!! the only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. this was the first game i ever put over hours into on steam, and it was worth it.",1

7044,"pros- very fair fp/pw model. the intructory story/tutorial is alright, just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda, but the game deserves praise for giving you access to a generous number of cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start (or at least, after finishing the tutorial). you can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of skyrim expansion with in-game currency, in less than hours of gameplay i was able to buy two of these decks for coins, which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorial/story. -great art, tes designs at their best. each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at, and they all come with accompanying sound effects and/or voice over. - the game's rng is one hell of an important factor in winning games. there's a big overlap between what a common card can do when rng favors it and what a legendary card can do when rng is not in its favor. what this means is that you absolutely do not need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it. good cards give you an edge, but good deck synergy and rng still reign supreme.-great card/deck identity. the game really benefit from the tes theme, each card and deck built around it oozes personality, and each combination of different races (or lack of) yields a solid, recognizable theme, different from all others. recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game. this ties into the game's balance: learn to pace your decisions. every deck has a certain rhythm to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains. learn them to make the most of each deck. cons- way, way, way too many rng mechanics. yes, this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game, but you'll eventually be on the receiving end of the rng beating. numerous cards have effects such as summoning a random creature. no, not a random creature from your deck, any random creature from the entire game. you will get screwed over by a hail mary at some point, you need to learn to accept that. this also ties into the next con:- built in comeback mechanic. as you burn through your opponent's life points, you'll break a total of runes. each time you break a rune, your oponent draws a card. if your opponents card is a prophecy card, they'll be able to play it immediately with no cost. this can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly, so most of the game's meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times. you are never entirely safe.overall, i recommend the game to all fans of tcg games. if you ever played a tcg game, you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition, and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it, and you don't have to pay a price of entry just to see if it's going to appeal to you.",1

9018,"starting off, if you do not have a decent computer, then this game probably is not the game for you.planetside is a massive online multiplayer, strategic first-person shooter, where the goal is simple and the answer is anything but. the goal: capture more territory for your faction, which is one of three themed teams. territories are captured by captureing points in a king of the hill and ctf kind of way. each territory has between and points that are captured by being withing a ccertain distance of a point. after that, it can take up to minutes for the territory to be completely captured. the only hard part is how you achive this goal and fend off players who are constantly running back from their spawn room or sunderrer (a truck) mobile spawnpoint. this is the hard part about this is the route that you take to do this. first off, there are factions who each have their own benefits, art style, and specalizations. the vanu sovreignty (vs) are a spandex peoples who believe that technology is the most important thing when it concerns the evolution of society. their weapons boast little bullet drop, and quick reload speeds. they also have some aoe guns (exploding plasma shots).the new conglomerate (nc) are the liberators, fighting for freedom. they have low fire rates with hard hitting weapons combined with huge magazines. just be prepared for the rediculous reload times. also the nc are very fond of shotguns.the terran republic (tr) are fighting for something (justice i think???). they have high fire rates and are very fond of chainguns.personally i specialize in being a close range infiltrator (they have lower health but have sheilds). smgs while expensive, are excellent killing machines. the other classes are the light and heavy infantry, engineer, medic, and max. each class has it's specific guns, abilities, and uses. the difficult thing about planetside is that positioning is vitally important. after about hours i started getting the flow of the game. by hours i was finally starting to mantain a kd above . this game has a steep learning curve and will take a lot of getting used to. however, i see the + hours completely worth it and can't wait till summer so i can play this a lot more.",1

10504,"wife is away for a few days... hours into thehunter in . days... first look tl:dr - i can only hunt things unless i get a subscription? *** that noise! put some effort into it, and click a couple things. that's not how it is. for more info, read the first section on what's really up.the real tl:dr - it's a hunting sim. if you like hunting, nature, and an experience that directly rewards you for the effort you put into it, give this a try. it's supprisingly addicting, fun, and rewarding.***my impression of the economy in the game, and possible solutions for you thrifty spenders who don't want a subscription;this game is not what i would classify as fp. the game you can download for free is basicly a demo that still allows you to interact with other people online, and experience a good scope of the game. you only have licenses for mule deer, and cottontail rabbits. you won't be allowed to shoot the bunnehs with the rifle they supply you with though. even if you don't invest a single penny into this game though, i prolly spent a good hours hunting mule deer with that free rifle alone. so why not give it a try? (you have unlimited ammo for that rifle)want to hunt the bunnehs too? for one single for all time investment of $ usd(from henceforth, all money i list will be in usd. for you gbp, euro, and other users), you can get em$ of the game currency. you can get a shotgun for em$. while ammo for the shotgun won't be free like the ammo for the rifle, you can still get the ammo for free for some time just from playing. accomplishing missions(read 'tasks') will earn you gm$ which can be spent on various consumables in the game, like ammo! (em$ is the premium currency you have to buy with money. gm$ is the currency you can earn from completing missions in the game, like take down a point buck. em$ can purchase anything, while gm$ can only buy ammo, wind indicators, scent eliminators... consumables) as a guest(free player) you can still visit and explore every map on the game, and play with other people. however, mule deer can only be found on loggers point, and whiteheart island. the cottontail rabbits can be found elsewhere though. you can earn em$ from participating in our sponsers activities. i gather that's a lot of surveys, and emails you can direct to a junk email account. not worth it imo, but that option is there if you want to earn premium currency without spending money.the wayfarer starter pack is $.. it comes with various items, but most importantly weapons. it gives you a month license which provides you with licences for all animals in the game, and unlimited ammo for all guns. it says basic ammo, but the only 'non-basic' ammo there is are the tracer arrows. it also gives you a shotgun, and a . pistol. you now have the ability, and weapons to hunt everything in the game. $ for months... most mmos cost that for a single month. it get's even better than that. it's actually only $. for a month membership. that's $. for days... that sounds pretty cheap to me, but i do completely understand not wanting to pay for it at all, so read on for ways to work around that!don't want to pay for a sub? not a problem! you can actually buy licences for individual animals for pretty cheap. say you can only really play on saturdays with your friend. you can pick up a hour license for any animal for em$. that's cents if you buy the cheapest money pack. the larger bundles are better values. $. for , $. = , $. = , $. = , $. = . so say you get for $.(be honest with yourself. you've spent more on crappier games. it's like the same price as a craptastic meal for you and your sweetie at taco bell). you now have em$, and a hour license is only . that's almost a year of saturdays worth of games with your friends. you can get a day license for . you can even buy licenses with gm$, which is the money you can earn in game. you can now take your free rifle with unlimited ammo and go hunt other animals.*** my actuall review :)i think it's a great game. i do think it's being marketed poorly. it really isn't what i consider a fp game like they are trying to list it as. a lot of people, including myself, saw that it was restricted, and required money to fully unlock the game, and said bs, i'm out of here. read the above. it's cheaper than most games you prolly play.this is a sim. this is not doom, or any other shooter. running is this game will only assure you that you never have a chance to shoot at anything, if you even see anything. slow and steady wins the race. or slow is smooth, smooth is fast, or (enter your choice here). it's all about the hunt. i spend most of my time tracking and stalking my prey, just to line up a single shot. they did well to make the tracking not be tedious, and there's always the suspense of not really knowing if your prey is on the other side of the valley, or around those trees.the envrioments are amazing. the trees look and move like trees. even the bark looks like bark, and holds up to close examination. the lighting is superb. the way the sun filters through the trees, and the sunrises are beautiful. i've found myself just wandering through the massivly large expanses of the maps, just enjoying the views. it's the closest you can come to experencing nature without getting off your lazy rump. check some of my screenshots or any of the others people take. it's a beautiful game.there is character progression. it's not an in your face tech tree. your abilities increase as you play. as you track an animal, your ability to track that type of animal becomes greater and easier. as you fire your weapon, you progressivly get better at handling that weapon...there's a decent variety of weapons.*rifles - take your pick. like the surgical precission accuracy of the .? the hard hitting power of the .x anshuitz? maybe something vintage, like the famous k from all your ww shooters. perhaps even more old school, like a caliber muzzle loader. there are many to choose from.*shotguns - shotguns your thing? dig in! extremly versitile with your choice of slug, buck, or bird shot. they let you hunt every animal in the game with a single weapon. come in a variety of styles for your needs. pump action, over under, double barrel, single shot, or the semi-auto gauge to paint the fields red with pheasent blood.*pistols - everything from the . for varmint hunting, to the ., ., ., up to the . raging bull*bows - yep, has them too! popular compund bows with high tech, auto selecting, range finder sights. precision readiness of the crossbow. classic styling of the recurve. then there's the classic, 'true hunting experience' of the longbow.all the equipment and supplies you can think of, and would want for your style of hunting. tents, blinds, stands, towers, bait, decoys, scent eliminator, lures... the also have numerous styles of camo and outfits for your practicle or stylish needs. different animals to hunt. twenty! small and ellusive like the rabbit and fox. kings of the forrest like the moose and bears. high climbing antics of the ipex. the petite roe deer, up to the massive red and reindeer. even ground locked and airborn birds, like turkies and geese.the games market is compartmentalized. you invest as little or as much as you want into it. at . for months, it's one of the cheapest subscriptions around. and if you start playing less, just pick up a small pack of em$, and only pay for the days you want to play(at .-. cents per day).try it for yourself. download the game for free, head into logger's point, and start hunting mule deer. the community, for the most part, is very friendly and willing to help new players learn the game. this is suprisingly awesome.",1

14772,"i have decided to rewrite my review completely to go over all of the current problems in more detail.i can see the game slowly fixing the balance issues and improving but it`s still not enough to make the game as good as it was before.first of all the new weapons :proto seeker - nerfed garbageshotgun - no complaints, but it feels unnecessary and pointless because of all the powerful long range weapons. it can only be used in close range if you have an invisibility module.mini shotgun - the same, but even more useless.loml - aka where it all began, for those who don`t know its the original disbalanced weapon update that everyone was outraged by. the weapon itself is idiotic because it takes no more than simple steps to use this weapon : . aim . wait . left click.aeroflak - probably the only weapon that isn`t bad, but it still ruins lifes of many flying bots.however the problem that ruined the game are not the weapons, but the epic loot update.before you could play cassualy (about - hours a day) and collect enough to buy a loml in days now it takes more than a week of grinding.crates are supposed to be something that you can purchase not a main way of receiving cash.i don`t want my cash income to be randomized. some say that it`s good because you can get premium items without having to pay for gc, but i haven`t seen a single person who prefers cosmetics over gameplay. also why should i grind for something if it`s unrewarding, random and boring. the feeling of progress is gone and is replaced by grinding and crates.there are also major score problems, but maybe i don`t entirely understand how the new system works. before it was simple - who dealt most damage gets first place. now people who do almost nothing can get first place for no apparent reason.new interface is not that bad, but please add an edit bot button in the preview section.inventory forge cost is incredibly bad. for example you built a k bot and you expect to get something for it, you see that you have purchases, but where is the cash ? it`s simple everybody uses inventory forge cost and you end up receiving absolutely nothing. just make so that if somebody inventory forges your bot you receive at least a / of the bots price, you receive only a half of a full purchase anyway.also cpu bot battles are just lomls a aeroflaks being pedofiles.i nearly forgot about new modules :invisibility - i don`t even know what to say about this one, it`s only used by shotguns and flying bots.shield - aka the least used item in the game, easy fix would be to make the shied move with bot.booster - aka how to make cpu bots better than cpu bots that don't have a module.",0

(mind you apollo is not even a default god, and you need a currency called 'gems' to buy gods in this game) (there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money...) so, after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods ao kuang thanatos and guess who get again? yep, you guessed it. apollo. i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that, but to top it off ao kuang and thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and there's no way to escape it, you just instantly die... and it heals ao kuang and then he can fly away and do even more damage, so after my teammate got eaten by an ao kuang, which then landed on me killing me? i just uninstalled. (((none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money) oh yeah, and before i even started playing, there's some gods they released that they didn't even finish, causing massive balance issues. such as hel, artio, and ullr, they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game. if hi-rez fixes these things, i will make my review positive, but as if now i can not reccomend this game.tl;dr: pay to win game with no updates since after devs abandoned the game, dead community, and extreme balance issues.",0

4895,i honestly like this game a lot especially when i play with friends but it has become so unbalanced recently i just cannot stand it half the time. they keep buffing items that certain gods will almost always get unless you're building wrong or making some new joke build but don't nerf the gods themselves because we don't want them to rely on item too much even though % of the time you're gonna build it anyway whether you rely on it or not. and some gods just feel terrible to go against because they have some stupid gimmick to them or dumb ability that takes absolutely zero effort but gives a huge reward when you use it because why not. also they keep ruining dog skins with terrible voices.,0

6774,"well i gave it a good shot and played for hours.damage:you probably don't remember the days when soldier of fortune came out and you could literally blow the bad guys arms and legs off. well i'm not looking for that, as there are kiddies present, but what i am looking for is some damage effect. since when can a person get wounded by three or four bullets and still run, move and aim like a champion?hud:so you've stealthfully walked, run, swam and crawled your way across half the map to capture a point and when you do a big circle appears over your head and tells every player on the map where you are. almost as incoherent are the 'enemy spotted' tags which appear over your head if you ever dare fire your weapon. no matter how cleverly hidden you are, every enemy soldier on the map will see a nice red arrow pointing at you if you do. the only solution is to emulate the snipers who camp on top of a hill at the back of the action if you want to rack up the kills. tanks:the tanks are seriously over powered which ruins it for anyone in the infantry. this could so easily be balanced with early access to anti-tank grenades.linear warfare:the main disappointment for me is the linear battles where you must take point a before point b before point c etc. this makes it far too easy for the enemy to park a tank at point b or just pound it endlessly with shells knowing that if we fail to take that one undefendable barn then the whole battle is over.conclusion:what could well have been a great open world game is now a counter strike clone with tanks that take no damage from rocket launchers. spawn, get sniped, spawn, get tanked, spawn and get shot by the guy hiding in the loft where you spawned. i almost gave in and was going to spend some money to buy a shovel but thought better of it. play it for a while until the battle fatigue and shell shock sets in, even throw the devs a dollar or two, then go do something constructive.",0

16354,"don't bother. developer is a nutless piece ofthat obviously doesn't know how to run a db. the game's back-end is a complete mess. expect to have your recent activity wiped at any time because of server issues (this has happened several times in the last few weeks) and then be completely ignored while asking for help in the forum (unless maybe you've actually made use of the microtransactions or dlc? i guess free players don't ever translate into paying players?). you can also expect to have your account deleted in it's entirety if you are inactive for months, which in my opinion is only proof of the cluster they call a back-end.personally i lost in excess of ,xp i was saving to unlock the next gun, when their servers crapped it a few weeks ago. despite their forum post explaining and asking people who have lost progress to reply, several weeks have passed while i personally have been completely ignored. and i have screenshots! they seem unable or unwilling to trace my account activity to verify my claim and re-instate my lost earnings (that cannot be earned again because in-game achivements are still registered as complete). their preferred method of explaining that they can't or won't help is to literally just completely ignore me.the game itself is fine. it's functional and does exactly what it says on the tin, but the database is strung together with spiderwebs and old coathangers. there's not much more to say about the game itself - it's fine. it has few bugs. it works. it's exactly what you'd expect and no more. in-game progress can be frustrating as the entire web of possible guns is not shown, with only the next guns in any particular branch having visible icons and only the immediate next actually being named. if you want to unlock a specific or favourite gun, good luck trying to find out how to get to it!english is not the first language of the developer, which is obvious from reading the forum posts from them. that in itself is fine as they do an adequate job of communicating (when they decide your comments or questions are worth responding to at all - despite their claims of how active they are in their community; re: not actually active at all), but anyone who has been gaming for long enough should know that russian devs areat what they do. this trend continues here. also, thanks to one of the in-game achievments, do not be surprised if you have randoms requesting steam friend accepts just for the achievment. you can also expect to see cheaters on the high scores board every day, plus the high scores are broken, almost always with your faster time being displayed and ranked below someone with a slower time.if all this sounds like fun to you, then have at it! this player, however, has had enough.",0

9798,"wost mmo i've played in a long time. freemium and pay-to-win at its finest. most free mmos have paid cash items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in pvp or not i don't care its still bull. this game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will literally teleport behind you breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests don't work properly, the options don't work properly. now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for some games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is d and d moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip skills if you want more you have to pay for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you pay for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or pay to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the ui is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for hours telling me to hit left ctl for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute i got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. i love mmorpgs but this is the worst i have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will never play again. only reason why i played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others mmos with each other for a week. in short: god this was utter trash and a nightmare to play i never want to play again nor probably never will.*i was playing add which is supposidly a mage class apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther mmos because i used a potion that healed hp and barely healed a th of my hp and this game doesn't show your max hp so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much hp you have, and the potions are on a second cool down. seconds even if you have different potions on your quick slots they all go on cooldown, if the potions regened health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.",0

5596,"its world of tanks 'lite' or diet world of tanks. but is that necessary a bad thing?its not but as far as games go from wargames (the company) this one is blatantly after your money and divides its fan base by not giving the historical guys what they want (the game is now plagued by fantasy tanks eg dracula tank).now i dont mind buying the odd rare tank, gold for upgrading here and there. i dont spend money on coffee throughout the week and thats how i justify it. however in world of tanks and world of warships you dont need to spend real money if you dont want to, in this game its constantly trying to get you to part ways with your cash. it does this through its terrible equipment upgrades where it will take up to days to upgrade after purchasing, or you can spend real cash now to have the upgrade instantly... yep.over the years i played this game i have seen upgrades that meant my past purchases were made null and void. no sorry from the company. therefore if you spent real money on upgrades or a tank with good stats, there is no guarantee that a future update will make your equipment obsolete, or your tank nerfed. this is bad.world of warships for me is more a stable platform, where i feel its not actively trying to steal money from my wallet. if i do purchase a premium ship or captain points they dont nerf the ship at a later update or invent a new skill point system that makes my past purchase of captain points null.this would all have been fine if you can play blitz without spending dough, however the game is made so you cant.i would avoid this in the long run.ps the game also harbours a terrible and toxic community. prepared to be followed and trolled by a whinny cry babies spewing cheap insults and demanding you uninstall the game.",0
844,"it's very rare that i am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i don't like. wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game...i mean this game is bad and i mean really bad! the map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. oh let's not forget when i logged in for the very first time, i received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. i literally got invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. i could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. an option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. my gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. i lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out i did not hit him once! so throughout the match i sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. and of all the ridiculous solutions i've found this has got to be the worst. i found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. the trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (i know i'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.and then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which i gotta say wow. people who hack in this game are way too comfortable in cheating. from what i've seen these hackers walk around like yeah i'm cheating...the f*** you gonna do about it?! in some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. but not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so i guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. shame on me for not noticing this sooner. i get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. this game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. the problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (who knows you miles may vary)",0

2111,"overview: path of exilethis game is technically an mmo, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. if it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. the gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).pros: ) microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest. ) character balance and variety. there are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just - use these or always lose web builds for op classes - from what i've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced.) community. there are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. as always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people.) audio. the ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour.) details. the devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to potions, which refill as you slay enemies. the game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.cons:) repetition. although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. it's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant.) actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. although boredom is a death sentence in most games, i think i'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point.",1

6914,"as a huge fan of the elder scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me! it's really personal preference whether you play this, magic or hearthsone etc but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double laning system in esl. the story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and they're many different ways to test out new decks created, vs ai or actual players. there is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too, and also there is a nice addition of solo arena which pits you versing tough ai characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose times. each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards. the deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation. overall this would be my favorite card game in its current genre. /",1
5179,"product received for freeearly access reviewhuh where i even start...the game it self it's just another d party fighting game based on multiple gamemodes. once you start the game for the first time. you probably are gonna play free for all since it's the most gamemode played when you start playing it. you have characters to use and more coming up, but there's only characters to use for free per week you can also unlock characters with the currency of the game, each one with types of weapons including the unarmed fists. the game it self it can be seen as a competitive game or a fun party game depends on the case your working.once i got hours on the game i started playing the gamemode ranked. where i started learning a lot of the game and also some cool tricks to use like the gravity cancel, once i knew some combos with my main character (asuri) i started taking the game as something more serious since i never had a game that keep me playing it for that time. i started playing the game since it was around weeks old. so i grew up with the game, i never wanted to search for combo videos since i wanted to learn how to play it by myself. so after hours i had atleast characters unlocked i was rank gold with only one skin buyed. since it was thoose days where i started using other characters instead of my main character. now that i passed the hours i can already tell that i spend a lot of time of this game. around hours per day. this game make me find new people who are now my friends. but as always nothing it's perfect. this the moment when i stop talking about the pros and start moving to the issues i have with game. the game itself it can be seen as a competitive game, but that doesn't mean your not gonna find people who probably be there just trying to be a jerk with everyone they found on the game. the game it'self has some players that take the game to seriously so they probably will try to win no matter what instead of having fun as the game it's supposed to be. so don't feel angry if you fight someone and after the match he left without saying gg or letting some insults in the chat, and also when they won they will probably will say ez instead of gg. to make the things more easier to explain, you will find a lot of salt on this game.at the topic of microtransactions. this game like almost every fp game, have microtransactions, but that doesn't mean this is a pay to win game. since that the only thing you can buy it's character skins, k. o. effects, sidekicks, and avatars. so the microtransactions doesn't affect the gameplay itself. if i was a videogame reviewer, i will probably say that this game itself it can be funny to play but only with friends. but since i have + hours on the game, the only thing i can say it's...and it's pretty amazingit's a pretty fun game.-rayzoomfox",1

5835,"hello,this game is a piece of art. some say it is the best mil avio sim there is out there. even with its free module you will find yourself capapble of doing many tasks and missions (using the wide weaponary). but don't think you will be able to hop in the game and start doing all the ace manuevers and tactics. you will have to put your mind to it and approach it with the atitude of learning new stuff. game is in no mean necessary to be played as if you are a real pilot. you can take it casualy, but you will still need to take notes and be patient. the feeling of reward after succeding is huge. after you master the frog, you can try out some of the other modules and see what suits you. you might be a ground pounder or a fighter guy. or maybe a rotor head ? you can go back and fly some of the older gen planes as well. new modules are being brought out often.some tips i have are:- take notes !!! - get a stick (even a cheaper one)- get yourself a headtracker (trackir, facetrack(homemade trackir)- as much as you all love steam, i recommend getting the standalone game as you will be able to use all the avaliable mods on the forums (terrain, texture, sound, liveries) - register on the forums so you can see what new content there is from the community ( mods, screens, vids, news and projects) if you are using a single monitor i recommend playing the game in windowed mode(it is borderles so you wont see a diff) as it allows you to alt+tab a lot easier without any issues and last but not in meaning. if you ever have time, check out the mission editor tool. it is a powerful tool where you can unleash all the imaginary missions you ever had. has lurning curve as anything in this game.i've been flying the a-c for years(nearly ) now and f-c for year and a half and i am happy with the amount of time i've inversted in this. don't be scared that you won't be able to do something or it is too complicated. no such thing. if anyone wans help or tips for those two modules i could help out :) cheers and see you in the sky. shoutout to the th server, the best pvp server !p.s: if you wonder why i have so low game time. it is because i play the standalone version. i downloaded the game on steam just so i can write this review.don't be scared to ask me any questions about the a-c and f-c",1

2155,"pretty standard game of that genre.you can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. what i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. you have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.the (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. but pricings of around bucks for an armour set, around bucks for headgears or currently up to bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.all in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. it simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while.

979,"hello friends! this game is one of my favorites. i've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. so if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. this game is also % free to play! with absolutely no pay to win involved. crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) you can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. some of which are really cool and lovingly made. and no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. the models and graphics in this game are georgous. it plays smoothly and is well optimized. it is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. but honestly it is amazingly polished. and at the time i am writing this things are in a great place. the balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. the thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though i love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team. i hope you pick this title up and love it the way i do. see you out there.",1

7887,"hearing stories of dungeons & dragons seemed epic and i loved the concept. i've never played the card game with anyone, and when i stumbled upon this game, i was quiet amazed.i have experienced many mmo's, from wow to a million of other titles - but i've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to wow. all of them were reflections of what wow became and it seemed pointless playing other mmo's. this is a whole other story.the character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and bond with your fighter as weird as that sounds. with these sort of games it's hard to see the things that make you stay from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that i put into the game is because of the combat system. you don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. it's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. you might have a friend that is a priest, like you, but he might be a engaging in battle priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. the opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. that is the main reason i stayed and i'm not vouching for anybody else. the game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then neverwinter should be your choice. there is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. the monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you should find challenging. they range from demented souls to... dragons.but yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. if you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice i can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.by no means am i an expert in this game, but i hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game.",1

lmao!! and $ for premium? wtf?!?!? at most its worth $! at most!i've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. and then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of hell itself. how? idk. supposedly, at some point, freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. the crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. premium was never worth the price. in the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. as a newbie back then, i can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. after a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. and of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. and after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. but thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get of that item, let alone the or you'd need for it to be viable. and by that time, the devs would have initiated at least different metas. in the early days, everything was relatively balanced. of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. after a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). so, they did some quick patches to fix that. r.i.p. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. while that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. there were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). so, slap some tier armor on, then slap some tier guns on, go rek the tier people, ggez. but tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. then came the flak cannons, rip flyers of all kinds. then came rockets, rip everything. then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (i forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. then came the shotguns. then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. after that i left, no surprise really. i'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since i left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than i think (which is saying something, cause i think its a ton). there's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. you want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? even the most popular robocraft youtuber, rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. really the only remaining popular robocraft youtubers are gromek and jac. i can only assume that they are paid by freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, i don't know how anyone could make a positive video on robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. they could pay me $mil a video and i still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a game. in conclusion, don't waste a single second on this game. but even more importantly, don't spend a single penny on this game, freejam doesn't deserve your money.",0

14671,"like many other reviewers before me, i am also dissapointed with this game. before the crate update robocraft was a game i told all my friends to play. unfortunately, the devs ruined this. constanly ignoring their community, the devs release updates that dramatically change the game. usually their changes are not for the betterment of the game, but instead, to deepen their wallets. over the years i have played this game, i've seen everything that used to make this game great, get ruined by the devs implementing pay to win systems, loot boxes, and getting rid of some of the most satisfying aspects of the game. robocraft is now robosh*t",0

3627,"i got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money, and i have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase. over hours over a span of years i've played this game and watched it grow, add new things. i was there from the hatless update april , up to the smissmas update. the game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decissions i wasn't very fond of. if its something valve are masters on it is to build a game that's all about the gameplay. its by their flawless designs that their games like left dead, counter-strike and team fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day, despite some of them being decades old. looking at team fortress it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games, especially when saw a surge of other class-based arena shooters like overwatch and battleborne (haha) i will say i played overwatch for about a year, it was the christmas of when i first got overwatch and at the start, i enjoyed it. but over the year i played it the sessions when i played it grew further and further appart, until i only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didn't touch the game. it was then i really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game, how it had been polished to perfection. something as simple as the loadouts, simple change of weapons could completely alter the playstyle of characters in this game, swap the engineer's wrench out for a gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the offensive rather than defensive. the medic's main weapon, syringe gun vs blutsauger changes whether he's a battle medic or not. the syringegun allows you a passive health regen of hp but blutsauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regen by points, making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive, and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regen after escaping close encounters.that's only examples of ways classes can change depending on their loadout. every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their loadout. in games like overwatch your hero has counters, meaning you can't master a class to the point where you're unbeatable because he's been designed around a rock-paper-scissors design to where some hero can take you out. in this game it was just about picking a class, selecting a loadout that suits your playstyle and going to town. there was very little counters, each class could take out the other equaly so long as you played it right. (with class exception..) the community also helped make this game great, by offering custom game modes, custom maps, custom servers. it was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it, allowed the community to create and take part in it. something overwatch doesn't allow past letting them design skins.. what has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that i feel it has lost its way. many of the people i used to play with have moved on and the community isn't the same as it once was. the community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are minecraft servers with ads out the a*s to try and cash in ad revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favorite game. that's not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community, the dev team has plenty to do in it as well. trying to make the weapons balanced, the team went back and fourth with alot of the weapons in the game, improving some that were before worthless (like the quick fix) and but turning some before good weapons, bad. the problem is that when listening to a community, you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt. keep in mind, its not the people using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced, its the people getting killed by them that's complaining. much like how cod nerfed its shotguns down to being useless, the game killed alot of good weapons and ruined some peoples' loadout. but it wasn't also loadout changes, adding things like competitive play to the game, i still feel was one of the worst decissions ever. the games random crits system, is there for a reason. its there as a boost of luck, so that even if you're better than everyone else, you might have a critical rocket strike you, or a critical heavy or scout which you would've otherwise escaped from or defeated. could you imagine if cs:go had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg it'd count as a crit and kill the person? the community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and insta-kill the person they were shooting at. i no longer play team fortress , because the state its in is not one i like. i have played it a bit in recent times, but that was doing tour of duty with some friends, as mann vs machine is a gamemode i still enjoy. but even if i no longer play it, i will never forget the friends i made through it, i won't forget the trading i did through it, i won't forget the fun times i had on it. hours, amounting to more than half a year. some would call that a waste, but i wouldn't have traded those hours for anything. thank you for the memories team fortress .",1

14920,"it's hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played ever-so-often. they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i. i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made, and that these team-based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times, as every time i upgraded my parts, i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do. trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted, and flight is just as bad. there is no way in hell, as a beginner class, are you going to be able to fly decently in this game, especially after the most recent patches i last saw. the game's devs have basically ed with the game so much, that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it (which was two years ago). it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with. (in other words: if it isn't broken, don't fix it).and it's surprisingly still in early access.i still don't understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement, because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it.the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot, whether on wheels, feet, or in the air; the creativity part of this game is what makes it good. the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are, which, in order to get any more of these things, you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts, and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs. how much you actually get per round.",0

10731,"card game is for sure my favorite digital collectible/trading card game (ccg/tcg). it's super free-to-play friendly and you consistently get free packs & cards over time. even in the beginning, you don't feel like you are completely outmatched just because someone has rarer cards in their deck than you. you can play budget decks (see and still win with a good strategy.it's a bit closer to magic the gathering (mtg) than simpler card games like hearthstone and shadowverse in that you still draw power cards rather than gain power evenly each turn, but there are a lot more mechanics compared to mtg that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power. it's also more like mtg in that it's more complex than the other digital ccg options out there. one major benefit over mtg is that this is strictly a digital game, so you have fun mechanics that would be very hard to pull off for mtg since that still has to cater to a physical card game. for example, stats on killed units remain even if the card returns from the void.just recently (dec ), a new set of cards has come out that has really added to the deck-building options. it feels like the popular decks are always changing and you have many different options with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck isn't always the winner.you are definitely rewarded for playing against other players, but, especially in the beginning and after a new set is released, playing against the ai is fun and gives you a lot of cards. the reason is that when you draft cards, unlike other games, they are permanently added to your deck. how cool is that?definitely try it. it's free-to-play and you never feel pressured to put money into the game. you can play on ios, android, steam, & xbox and they are always kept in sync and all rewards are available on all platforms. achievements sync too (except xbox). pvp play is cross-platform.note that you get a free preconstructed deck by using a referral code to sign up (i don't want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you found my review helpful; i'd appreciate it). that said, don't feel bad if you didn't get the deck. you can get all those cards fairly quickly even if you don't use a referral link.the game does make you play the first six or so games of the tutorial, but after that you can skip the tutorial from the settings menu if you don't want to complete it. also check out reddit for a really cool community and more information. there are also a couple links there to free promotions that get a free campaign. you can also get other campaigns by spending in-game currency that you gain just by playing; as i said, you don't have to pay anything. there are some extra visual items that you can purchase (deck backs, etc.), but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they are strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and/or support the developers. even without spending money, new cosmetic options are available to you fairly often.again, the current player-base would love to see the community grow. many players are very pro and competitive, but are great to learn from and super friendly. i am more casual, but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game. i also feel the art style is really cool without being too weird, gross, or overtly sexualized. i wouldn't feel weird about others seeing me play this game, unlike a couple other ccgs out there.",1

3639,"radically different from the going fps standard.a gem gameplay wise.it's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.that was the short version.if that didn't convince you yet, move along.the mechanics the playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:while one class is able to perform a mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.the variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. and believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk does make a difference.talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being pay to win options - not in team fortress .owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. this makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~ minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.there's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.i guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-fps-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something i greatly appreciate, for that's what i personally feel titles like call of duty are lacking.there's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: minor annoyances.eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.although years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.so, to recap:whether you are casually or competitively motivated,whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.and yeah.the only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download../, would will play again.",1

10812,"this is a digital card game with the depth of magic and the polish of hearthstone. direwolf has hired on some of magic's best pros to help out with the card design and it really shows.this game uses mtg attacking and blocking, meaning it is easier to get a stalled board than hearthstone, but so far i've not had too many issues with it because there are lots of way to break stalls with combat tricks and other cards. you can play instants in this game, though they are called fast spells, and can only be played in response to a card being used on your units, during combat, and at the end of turn. this is actually very nice because it means you aren't fing through your opponent's turn. there are a few rng cards, though nothing nearly obscene as in hearthstone.this game has you put your mana, which is called power in this game, in your deck, like in magic. however colors are done through influence. once you get of an influence of color, you can play any card that only has that influence requirement. so you don't have to worry about using the right color power. for players coming from hearthstone, the power system can be a sore point because you will come across times where you either draw too much power, or not enough power. you get a free mulligan each game. when you take a mulligan, you are stuck with what hand you draw. however after you mulligan, you are guaranteed to get at least two power in your hand. the free-to-play model is very generous. it follows the same pattern of hearthstone, but since each pack contains cards, rather than , it makes it easier to get all the common and uncommon cards. also, drafting and forge let you keep the cards you choose, which let you build up your collection that way.all-in-all, i would say this is an excellent game and highly recommend that anyone try it.",1

1920,"ok so its dota , the larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing, if you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer. you will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not? from a graphics point of view at maxed out on a gtx easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget pc with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *wooden pc* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst gpu's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace.from a gameplay point of view, as you can see i have spent well over hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from hours and above, the reason?well there is map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. so map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the + heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like really know it. how to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. so in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging.the community: this is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (i will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you.the ranking system and how valve makes its money: so the game is free and so how does valve make its money? well first let me explain the ranking system: basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (i think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. these costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a cv.also when you reach a battle point rank of you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level and higher to increase your mmr with the top mmr being and bottom (you really have to be bad to get ) with + mmr being very high. mmr is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, - mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.this concludes my review for dota with a few / statisticsalso please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players: ./gameplay: /community: / as it gets better later onranking/progression system: /",1

(sorry for caps)after fortshit and pubug we finally got a good br game which keeps realism, fun and seriousness in balance.it has the basic br game elements but also unique systems such as choose-where-to-spawn, helicopter win, non-circular zone restriction and fast travel by telecabin.this game was made by the same company that owns pubg (mobile) so you will see similarities (guns, sounds and the winner chicken dinner)it has the adventure pass which is something similar to the battle psst in fortn... nevermindit is not paywin but you can buy the adventure pass and get some cool clothesso much better than those two games mentioned above. go play it now, it's free.",1

5389,"the usual reason to play wot blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the porcelain throne, on a bus or in a queue. now i can add 'just for the heck of it (without using bluestacks)' to my list.after battles, i've unlocked:chi-nu, japanese tier medium tank,at-, british tier tank destroyer,su-, soviet tier tank destroyer,kv-s, soviet tier heavy tank,leopard, german tier light tank.i was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the kv- and decided i must also have it. the soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the t- (tier ). the kvs are very slow and virtually blind. it's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll getfrom behind by a leopard within the first minutes. the kv-s was incredibly weak until i got the best gun for it (costing k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean i'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.the british at- is the closest you get to cheating in this game. in a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off yourand shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. it has mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier (you're tier ). you're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.the soviet td line has been pretty much okay all-around. su- has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.german light tanks require skill. a masterful leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within seconds of the start of the battle. it's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. german tds are quite enjoyable, especially the hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.surprisingly the japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. i chose the light branch (ha-go, ke-ni, ke-ho) winning , and % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. the tier chi-nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. what made the light japanese tanks so fun was that i could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. shooting opponents is the fun part of wot blitz and the jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.i think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. at tier + everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. battles where you can kill - tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. so i think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.why i generally like wot blitz:) best time killer app i know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example) very short match queues - i don't want to queue while i queue) progressing through tiers of tanks feels good) at least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win) i get to learn tank names) a lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original wot for desktop",1

11226,"i quite enjoy this game, since i wanted to scratch my mtg-itch. it does a lot of stuff right: the game speed is nice, gui is enhancing the experience and there's a sense of progression as you grind your way up.what i don't like is unfortunately a core mechanic of the standard game: dead draws! how can they still be in a new card game?!it feels so punishing drawing resource cards when you want some kind of answer for the board. on top of that the deck size is cards with a maximum of copies per card and you're forced to make / of the deck resource cards!this game wants you to use a more watered down deck than mtg, increase the rng and restrict your deck building even more. i really feel this is a core problem with the game, so much so that i wouldn't recommend it.from what i've seen this is also the nail in the coffin for other players.in my mind the fix for this problem would be: allow hero/avatar powers. the campaign heroes each already have their own mana spell, which has a little effect (gain armor, ...) and draws you a resource card. why not make it a permanent ability?also remove the / of deck forced resource, so people have more freedom to build.i think i'll spend a little more time with this game, but once i'm bored i won't revisit it again unless there's a core change that tackles the dead draw problem. i only wish this promising game would stop sticking with frustrating mechanics of the past or else it will die rather quickly.",0

(edit: i didn't try farming @.@) yeah i can slaughter all the enemies, but im also able to tame them and harvest them peacefully. you can wack stuff with a sickle or hoe, or you could farm with lazors!!! or mine with lazors!!!

10490,"i gave this game a thumbs up, but this is a mixed review. i enjoyed the game immensely. however, i just don't enjoy it enough to pump funds into it. if it was a one time buy, then you're good to go, then i'd pay real money for it. but having to pay a subscription, i just don't get into it that much.now, as far as the game goes, it's very well done. you track animals and kill them. pretty simple. it's a little sci-fi, in a way, with your tracker. you see foot prints, your tracker will give you a cone of which direction the animal is heading. not too bad. but then you find droppings, and the tracker gives you a max range of how far they could have gone. now you have direction, and how far they could be. then, you hear a grunt, howl, cluck, etc, and the tracker pings your map exactly where the noise came from.now, if that's what you're into, that's fine. don't get me wrong, that last paragraph was not meant as a complaint, just information. i enjoy the tracker.the only thing i don't like about this game, is the recurring payments. you can hunt types of animals for free indefinitely, mule deer, a type of rabbit, and something else i can't remember off the top of my head. you have to buy licenses to hunt anything else, or pay a subscription to unlock everything.it's free to try and hunt and see how the gameplay is, so there's no risk. you might as well try it to see if you're willing to pay money into it. worst case scenario is you waste some time and realize you don't want to pay.",1

14531,"as of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. ill be talking about some major points.: weapons: types of t bots: rewards after each match: the matching system: removed tech tree: pilot seat removed: weaponsthere are major weapons i want to talk about. a: the worst one of them all, the rocket launcher b: anti-air c: shotguns.a: rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. to use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. one rocket does damage, and you fire roughly per volley. it can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.b: anti-air guns, flak cannons. they are absolute cancer when it comes to anything that flies or hovers. they detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for mechs who jump or crawlers who jump too. they cost the least and have the same explosive radius as the strongest plasma cannons, which is horse crap. they do damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.c: shotguns. these things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about yards. they can only be shot times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. they do the most damage with a shocking per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. they are strong too, with health, they can take quite a beating.: bots. there are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. a: mechs b: box fliers c: helis with rockets a: mechs are t. they have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. the most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. these bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. you can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. you can have litterally everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. if you put pilots seats back, it would make mechs a lot harder to build and use.b: box fliers. these things are the absolute worst. they dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. they do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.c: helis with rockets. these things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by plasma cannons or sometimes smgs, these things are horrible to deal with.: rewards. ok so, the rewards are pretty t, its chance. you could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. but if you get it, yaaay. you dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. i prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.: matching system. they have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with pflops, you get put in a game with people that have pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.: tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. a new player could buy the second strongest plasma cannon with ease, same with the smg. then refere to the matching system above: pilot seat removed: naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot and give it the best fire power possible and it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get t one shot.some people are complaining about the fact that you can have different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. if a plasma cannon user came up against an smg user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the smgs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. i think maybe reduce it to and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thosesummary: anything that flies is next to ing useless! rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. mechs need a nerf too. if you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns. the matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.",0

14696,"it's been about a year since i wrote the original review. somehow just about everything changed and i still have the same gripes with the game i had back then as now. balance issues persist, drones still reign supreme over all other bot types, and matches still feature people who routinely disconnect and other network issues. meanwhile the main initiative freejam has taken on improving their game is to advance robocraft into 'beta' which apparently entails throwing everything relating to game modes out the window and changing the point of the game from destroying enemy bots to standing on rings, blasting crystals, and endlessly punishing bots with slow mobility. what's funny is that in the face of all that, they only slightly tweaked a few balance points about the more broken weapons and mobilities to be less outstanding (and to their credit, in response to a lot of player feedback over the past several months as well), but the rush and apparent decision to enter beta and somehow trash every single map they had developed for the game up until that point just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything and shifted the game balance even more weirdly off center.there's a ton good about this game - robot construction is flexible and stable enough to let players build in just about any shape or configuration and have a functional fighting machine. a combination of paint and various block shapes allows players to construct bots with legitimately pleasing aesthetics and just really cool shapes. the decisions that players make in setting up their vehicle carry over directly into gameplay as well, with the unexpected structural weaknesses and exposed weapons being prime targets for skilled players to shoot in lieu of 'headshots'. at its core, robocraft is a game with sophistication and reactive tactics in terms of how to fight with basic marksman weapons, and this is an element of the game that has thankfully survived intact ever since i started playing the game back in - when there were still cockpits and a weird tech tree. even with all the new weapons they're trying to push, my favorite guns are the laser (smg) and railgun (sniper rifle), which both emphasize careful aiming the most of all weapons. in terms of effectiveness though, ions (shotguns) and large plasmas (grenade launchers) currently reign supreme.with everything i've seen, i simply don't believe that's how freejam sees their own game. i still cite one of their mislead past decisions that thankfully didn't carry through - a recalculated damage system where it wasn't possible to damage components or immobilize enemies aside from just stripping off their whole chassis and vaporizing the whole bot. that was a decision that, if it had actually gone through, would've killed one of the main redeeming factors of its gameplay for me. reflecting on it, it really illustrates what i think i've come to realize, and it's that freejam just doesn't know what they want from their game, and still cannot recognize what they're trying to go for. it has no mission statement. instead, they are mostly trying to blindly follow the leader and seem to be focusing a lot of their attention on making the game more 'accessible' to a wider demographic. that really could just be what robocraft is, though. they might've just sat down one day and said 'what if we combined minecraft with world of tanks?' and somehow it worked for about years. with how much i do like the game's potential, though, i really hope this isn't the case.",0
