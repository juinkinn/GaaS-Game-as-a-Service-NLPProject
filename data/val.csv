15626,"tl;dr as of right now.. i do not recommend this game. i am sure once it is finished it will be worth another look. however, right now, all it is a grinding game.i spent around 40 minutes going in a circle, grinding the same monsters over and over. i finish one quest that says i need to collect a certain item from a sneevil. then the next quest i need to collect a different item from sneevils. i counted the number of sneevil quests alone i did which comes to a total of 7. there are 2 other mobs in the area and i have done about number of quests for those mobs as well.there is no reward for the grinding as well. you may get dozens of level 1 scrap items you can sell, but no equipment and little experience. after the tutorial, i was level 4. after 25 or so grinding missions, i am still level 4.also, there is very little music if any. through the tutorial the only sounds present were the repetitive sounds made when attacking mobs. there is some good music at times, but it suddenly disappears at others.the one good thing i have noticed so far is the animation. the way you attack, as wells as your special moves, are very fluid and animated very well.in the end, i spent 45 minutes walking around grinding mobs, to no background noise, and received little to no rewards or experience. i would only recommend this to you if you really enjoy grinding mobs or you really want to support the franchise and help them test out their new game. otherwise, i recommend coming back and seeing how it is when it is all finished up.",0

2139,"what to say about path of exile? is it just another silly action rpg with mindless grinding on the market? well, the game has a lot to offer and i'm not, by any means, the best person to tell you everything about it, but, i can tell for sure, that i've experience enough to assure you that this is an amazing action rpg, with an immense variety of builds, items and gameplay styles, besides the complex item economy. the fact that you've no restrictions (in terms of classes / characters) to use items and skills, as well as skill tree paths, creates an enormous variety of builds, making every character an unique experience. the game has beautiful graphics, with an exceptional dark theme to it; blood and corpses are everywhere, and that really gives that gruesome ambientation and, on top of that, the soundtrack, background sounds and noises really adds to this macabre experience. most people say that this is the true successor of diablo 2, although i can't tell for sure if it's true or not, this game is, certainly, way better than the sequel that is diablo 3 (even with the dlc reaper of souls), don't get me wrong, both games are great, but path of exile has way more to offer and innovation is what the game industry is looking for. how is call of duty even alive?the game is going through constant updates and there is content everywhere, always something new to explore, be it items, areas, story, skills, etc.. the development team is constantly active and shows a lot of interest in what the community has to say about the game, which is a huge plus.tl;drastonishing gameplay, pretty graphics, amazing developers, complex economy and a huge variety in terms of builds. a game that i can't recommend enough for those who are seeking a new action rpg, give this game a try and you might be surprised -- don't be scared about the skill tree though.",1

12011,"played for roughly 2 hours. the best part of this game is the character creation screen. though graphic wise it's pretty good looking that's where it ends. for whatever reason optimization is horrible. the game runs best on max settings then it does on lower settings. class wise the way to level up skills and chaining them isn't really explained too well. it's a learn as you go type thing. mounts have energy and if you run our you cannot mount till it recovers or you use an energy recovery potion. side quests aren't really explained what to do especially the gather ones where it doesn't even tell you where to gather the items at. i hit level 11 within those 2 hours and was on a main mission quest where you had to kill a level 1 elite ghoul. it will 1 shot you dealing 1400+ damgae to you which is unavoidable if you're melee. balance wise the game is a giant joke. you can 1 shot certain mobs and in return get 1 shot by mobs you must kill to progress the story mission quests. i also ran into a bug where by dying to that level 11 ghoul and selecting to spawn at the ghost instead of having to spend gems to respawn right where i was, i would fall through the world over and over again unless i was able to time running the instant my characters ghost touched the ground. all in all it's a sorry excuse for a game. i understand personally now why it has failed in every region it has ever come out in. on my honest opinion as someone who's been playing mmo's since 2002, don't bother with this one. let it die alone in a corner and go to something else. it's not worth the time.",0

2872,"used to play this game every day despite the frustration of trying to tier up non russian tanks. as has been said many times in these reviews, the dev is russian and their bias towards russian tanks in the game is obvious. you can also fight in the sky in this game, but i never bothered much with that part of the game because the tank sim side was so well done. i enjoyed running circles around enemy tanks in my t-50 and blowing them all to bits (lower tier russian tank that was still op in that tier)however the latest patch just broke any will i had to play the game anymore, actually in my opinion it broke the (tank sim) game completely and turned off a lot of long time players from wanting to play it anymore. (me included) forcing lower tier tanks to fight the highest tier removed any fun factor from the game. essentially, if your not a top tier russian tank, but from the lower tier you will be forced into this match making system where you are as good as cannon fodder (does not matter how skilled you are, your shells will simply deflect off the higher tier tanks and do 0 damage. ww2 tanks vs. cold war tanks. only play the ground game in war thunder if you plan on only ranking up russian tanks, since devs seem to want to hinder the growth of their own game by creating over powered russian tanks and the recent update of the matchmaking system completely broke the later stages of the game. otherwise graphics are great, sound effects and being able to fighter bomber missions against opposing tanks during the round makes war thunder a unique ww2 tank sim that is worth the try, just beware of the broken match making system in higher tiers.",0

8869,"note: to see this review in its true form go to: 2 is massive multiplayer, free-roam, and free 2 play. the gameplay of planetside 2 varies. sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas. other times massive armies will attack for a large command post. now, because planetside 2 is a free to play game you might be wondering if the paying players get an advantage. the answer would yes and no. yes because paying players can get guns,armor, and upgrades faster, no because they don't get any paid-only weapons. for example they can't drop $20/$30 and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them.players in planetside 2 can choose from six classes. light assault,heavy assault,combat medic,sniper,engineer, and mech suit. planetside 2 is meant to be a tactics game, and i've had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit. in planetside 2 instead of clans you have outfits. now you can join a platoon without being in that outfit, but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online.visual-wise planetside 2 is great, textures are high-res, shadows are soft and lighting is done just right. the best part is that it doesn't take too much gpu or cpu power. the not so great part is that it only runs in 32-bit mode. gameplay takes part on three massive open-world continents on the world auraxis. the three continents you fight on are indar,esamir, and amerish. each map has its own theme. one is icy and cold, another is warm and wet, and the last is a dry arid wasteland. the servers are normally lag-free, i've played at least 15 hours and i can only remember lagging out four times, and that was when i was in a 200+ person battle. one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other leveled up players. but this just means the noobs should team up with the veterans and provide support, like a playing as a sniper,medic, or engineer. another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base, and that is that most players don't want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in call of duty shooting people in little killing sprees. thats not how this game works. and if you try to play it like call of duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win.the only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line, maybe a co-op campaign. it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the devs put into the factions and areas. i guess that's asking too much for a mmo. anyways, check planetside 2 out, its free,its fun, and its on steam.",1

16405,"tl;dr - interested in guns: oh,yeh!/10 | not interested in guns: meh.../10it's an okay game, but a wonderful guide to gun mechanics. the whole reason this game is worth it is there is nothing out there as interactive when it comes to the inner workings of a firearm. sure, there are detailed blowouts and schematics you can cruise around the for, as well as a few animation clips of them in motion. to actually be able to interact, slow down and watch how all the parts work together to show you how pulling a piece a metal leads to the firing of a bullet is just marvelous. i love telling all my gun buddies about this game/guide, and they all react the same way: mouth agape. the game modes are fun; good way to test the old brain memory function like playing sodoku with gun parts. you can unlock all the guns for $50 (or $35 when it's on sale) and it's totally worth that price for all the information and knowledge imparted onto thee about firearms. or you can be cheap like me, and grind your way to every gun in about 100 hours. that sounds like a lot, but honestly, it didn't even feel like 20 with all the fun i had learning with it. so, as a game, it's probably a 'meh...' to those who aren't interested in firearms; to those who are, it's a 'oh, yeh!' on my scale.update: still a great game that's still be updated with new guns (popular & obscure) that they give free promotional codes to the first 50 who claim them!",1

9888,"first off i have spent alot of time in this game i would not recommend it to someone who has a low income rate or isn't prepared to spend moneythe game can be fun and has a bit of life in it each new town is awesome to go to when you unlock it and the dungeons that come with it are really cool looking but have to do them atleast 3 times to move on to the next one in the story line is really annoying(it moves up to 5-8 times in the high levels)the leveling in the game is really hard to do without getting an exp boost item(its even hard with that but alittle easier) i have a charcter in the 80(cap is 85 at time of writting) and doing one dungeon gives about 8-9% of the exp bar and dungeons are your main sorce of levelingstay out of the item mall if you do play. i repeat stay out of the item mall. it is not needed to go into it but getting something from it costs alot of money. there are costumes in this game and you'd expect them to have nop stats and just change how you look kog said that you buy a costume it makes your stats better than a f2p. the costumes cost around 25-31 dollars to get the whole set which also have set bonuses to increase your stats even more.pvp is not worth doing. all pvp comes down to is stun locking(its a system whereif you get hit you are stunned for a second and if you keep hitting they stay stunned there is a way to get out of it but it's crap).it boils down to who can hit first and thats it which makes so slow attacking charcters useless. if anyone losses in pvp they just complain about something you did or that a charcter is op. i will admit new charcters are pretty unbalanced and kog takes their sweettime balancing themover its not to bad of a game even though i have jsut been ranting. the scenery in each town, field, and dungeon look awesome but you spend so much time in town little time in fields and so many runs in dungeons it losses it attraction to be there. the charcters all have their own personalities and are really cool. each one play differntly then the other and it has a job system where you can change how they play ever further. guilds can feel like home if your in the right ones but big ones can fall very easily and not many people talk. i only have so many hours in this game because i only get on to talk to friends i have made in it.in conclusion i would recommend this game if this things i stated up above were improved and made better to make the game alot more fun but as it is right now i simply dont not recommend it if you love fantasy places and exploring or grinding a on you might enjoy this game but if not stay away. i hope the review helps your decision in downloading this game and have fun if you do.",0

6751,"this game has some decent foundations, but you'll quickly realize it's just a clunky pay-to-win mess. some of the mechanics are okay, some aren't; shooting is decent, hit detection is atrocious, and the sheer number of hits some people can survive is bizarre. are people paying real money for armour that lets them become bullet tanks? i hate this game.red orchestra 2 is better in just about every way; better shooting mechanics, hit detection, graphics, ambiance, gritty warzone feeling, spawning, capturing, everything. red orchestra 2 is the game to play if you're looking for ww2 combat. everything you do in that game is a struggle for control of the battlefield and every kill, suppressing fire, and advance is satisfying and helpful for the entire team. heroes and generals completely fails to have that in-depth feel.strangely enough, i was excited that this game would be mmo and you could traverse the western front and choose where to battle, but you can't, it's not an mmo, it's just done in map instances. even red orchestra 2 has more players per match. way more. play red orchestra 2 instead of this, you won't be let down.oh and, heroes and generals is pay-to-win. enough said.",0

8550,"the only review you need -my review is at the bottom but do these steps first:1.) install and play this game until you're frustrated - this could be 2 hours or 100 (it's free, why not)2.) after step 1, put this game in your back pocket and play something else3.) cross fingers and hope hirez steers this game in the right direction4.) if 3 happens, log back in and enjoy!---my review:i found this game because it popped up as the top game on twitch (ninja and many other top streamers were playing). this game was incredibly fun and i looked forward to playing it after work every night. however... i soon realized why everyone complains about hirez's management style when developing games. it felt like i was riding in a full capacity bus at 80 mph and it decided it wanted to make a sharp left turn. out of nowhere, hirez removed the forging option for your legendary weapon, to instead, loot it from random chests. after backlash, they added forging for class weapons back, only to then add hitscan automatic guns (smg and assault rifle). it now felt like they removed forging yet again because why even make your class weapon when a low tier smg or assault rifle will light you up in 2 seconds? (this was my frustration phase - i stopped playing at this patch)i recommend doing my steps above because this game has a lot of potential. with hirez behind the steering wheel, i don't think that potential will ever be realized. the game is moving away from what made it unique - the classes, skills, and class weapons. in the world of gaming, there are many options. even the smallest of changes can send a player base running.my recommendation to hirez:focus on what makes this game unique. add more class skills and legendary class weapons. make it feel worth my time to play and master a specific class. make steady, logical changes and focus on bugs and quality of life for patches. there are a lot of fps games out there and i didn't play this game because of the weapons. i played this game because i could pick a class, form a unique build with my skills, create my legendary weapon, and fight to the death in a nail biting, last man standing scenario.tldr: game is incredibly fun at first. hirez makes too many abrupt changes. chicken/forge/classes/skills system is really unique. game has a lot of potential but do not commit yourselfhope you enjoyed my heartfelt review - i appreciate your time reading this :)",1

4876,"this is a very good change of gameplay compared to league which going back to that game feels too easy and rather dull in gameplay compared to the dynamic actions in smite.here are beginner gods you should try that i find too easy to use.adc: cupid, apollo, neith, artemis.mid: posidon, kukulkan, anubis, scylla, vulcanjungle: fenrir, loki (great for split pushing), thor, mercury (basicly the hecarim of smite),support: athena, sobek, ymir, chang'e, ares (if enemy buys purification beads buy cooldown reduction tanky items)solo: pretty much any god can solo easily in smite even supports like sobek, ares, yimir, even the adcs can go solo lane since most of them are equiped with mobility or with good crowd control attacks.smite is a third person moba with the same objectives as dota and lol, 3 lanes, 2 jungles, 2 jungle bosses, towers, inhibitors (pheonix), titans/nexus.i've been playing this for over a year now and personally i find the gameplay, controls to be alot more fun and it has its own unique stragety to it.for example your map radar only shows near sight of enemy/objects but only you can see whats directly in front of you, you can see enemies in the distance but your allies cannot so you need to describe the enemy situation by voice commands build into the game or if your fast type in like kukulkan has low mana or anubis stun down along with voice commands that say ultimate down.for my experience the community has been pretty sweet up till 2016 where i started seeing more trolls and ragers than ever.you will expect some poor scrublord to rage theirat you in any multiplayer game but they don't even know how good you can be in late game team fights which sadly low elo and just incompetent players do not understand.",1

3581,"ok, so, data collection aside, the game is pretty good. if something good is free then you are the product.mobility is nice and diverse (glider, snowboard and climbing pack).biggest problem (in my opinion) are the bots. the game auto-fills a server with bots. i would say there are around 15-20 players/game out of 50.that being said, it's probably going to get better as the player base increase, but i would rather wait 2-3 mins for a game queue rather than play with bots (most queues are around 15secs). ai is dumb as all hell and on top of that sometimes it glitches and they just stand there for target practice.it's obvious it is not finished and they still need to add a lot of stuff. there is only 1 map and pistols are, for the most part, useless. there are no upgrades for them. shotguns are also kind of useless as most engagements happen over long distances.if you're scared about the game sniffing around your pc you can try to sandbox it, i guess, or in a virtual machine. i play it on an hd7700 as an emergency since my regular card blew out a few weeks ago and i get decent fps for such a large map.i've been playing it with some buddies and we had quite a bit of fun with some intense moments.customization is pretty low at the moment with few clothing items available and no snow camouflage or white items whatsoever, mostly dark color apparel making you stick out like a sore thumb on that white background.",1

16830,"access reviewthis game may seem fun on the surface, and why wouldn't it? great graphics, guns sound great, and who wouldn't want to run around while wearing a pot on your head? it all sounds great, until you realize the game controls feel like they were made for an xbox controller, and climbing up ladders is absoutely abizmal. my friend and i came across a couple of bugs, the first bug we came across, i was on top of a car while my buddy was driving it, and he all of the sudden died, and it said it was me who killed him. another bug we came across was when me and him were crossing a bridge, and i just suddenly phased through the bridge. i couldn't move, i couldn't jump or prone or do anything to get out of it. the only reason why i was able to get out was because my friend drove up to me with a vehicle and i was able to get into it. if i was in a solo match, that match would have been done right then and there. on top of that, people are running around rampant with a golden pan that 1 shots people. in conjunction with them equipping boots of speed, which makes their movement speed 10x faster, virtually making them unkilliable. there are arguments on forums and threads saying git good and that would be true, if it didnt 1 shot. atleast the framerate was good, and the sounds were awesome. there is talks of hackers running around as well, however, i've never seen or caught anyone that was for sure hacking. i mean there were some pretty fishy moments but nothing really solid. this game has a ton of kinks that need to be ironed out. tl:drpro's: good graphics and soundscon's: 1 shot weapon in a battle royale game (seriously what were you thinking), game breaking bugs, and controls.",0

690,"if you wanted to play free to play games, this one, don`t even bother playing it.this is a game where developer try to imitate counter-strike games but failed horriblely,and they dare to add the most useless, and unworthly microtransaction. only they selling is just a skin.skin that i mention is skin of a gun, emblems, and of course masks.thats it? thats what you can do on the microtransaction? super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $0.99 each?so its complete useless microtransaction, so how about the game?its a 2 gamemode only, skrimish, and elimination.skirmish is similar to team-deathmatch, only this here, is a bad skirmish game, elimination is idk vs idk counter-strike rip-off. balancing team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.guns are just a ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it fun to shoot at, here is zero fun. i didn`t enjoy at all, p90 why u too nub to shoot, shotgun, why u too op, m249, why u 1 shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. except shotgun, which is super effective.server is only in 3 channels, where player need to join the channels room to play, but i found out this is very familiar.is this a developer from 3d blockade? server was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. for me, at least on asia. i probably realized this was hosted on russia. right. i also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?hackers, yeah. it has, but is it hackable without ban? yeah. no one give a damn about banning a person. you can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? no, no one will win if someone vote no on purpose of gaining winning. ban vac? who gives a shyt, no one get ban.graphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. there`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. its like incomplete release.and lastly, did i mention the game have leveling system... talk about the useless leveling system ever created? you gain exp by winning a game. so what it does for exp? nothing. yeah nothing. zero functionality in exp. except unlocking skin which requires you 0.99$ to buy???seriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, i despite everything this game yet to offer. even though its free, you may thinking, free is the reason why you set yes as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, i feel like i need to play other game instead. i say a lot of free games like blackshot is even better than this, even a game like crazy shooter online is 20 times better, this game isn`t. its just a garbage game.there`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. i just can`t, i just wanted more biceps for playing a shooter games. in the end, games sucks. go play other free game instead.(2/10)",0
3216,"it is a fun game, but i've grown very frustrated waiting for the match making. one night i waited 10 minutes for the match to start, got killed after maybe 5 minutes, then exited and waited for a new match to start. i waited 20 minutes and then got a message that the system timed out. started waiting again for another match which ended up being an 8 minute wait. so, basically got to play for 5 minutes and waited nearly 40 minutes. they need to change the matchup system. start matches with less people and less waiting - then it might be fun to play. right now i've lost my interest.",0
13359,"in short: a good sandbox game with a welcoming community. a bit less short: while it gets compared to minecraft quite a bit, i think it does enough to establish itself as something different and not just a clone. the devs are a fairly active part of the community which can be seen by reviewing the games forums. additionally, they release fairly regular updates containing new features, improvements, and new blocks to build with. ultimately, this is a fun game to play solo and a great game to play with others.about free-to-play: i'm typically skeptical of free to play games, but feel the monetization in this one is prety fair. as of this review: revenue is based on the sale of pro dlc, welcome bundle dlc, and 'coins'. coins are used to purchase from the in-game shop and items for sale include block recipe sets (learn once, use on any 'world'), convenience items (extractors, dynamite, etc) that can otherwise be crafted in game, and (new-ish) costumes.",1

(this one's a con, and a pro - depends on how you like to play)freely building on/in your cornerstone is a nice feature, along with the items you can later get to upgrade the appearance of it. lots of freedom to build whatever you'd like, in all honesty. feel free to give it a try, i'd recommend it.",1

(do disregard the hours. i've played for a while mostly on the non-steam client.)= - = - = positives = - = - =fun with friends:honestly, this game can give several hours of banter and being idiots on the game. i can't normally play this game without others playing it, especially after a while of playing. stamnia bar:while this may limit progress, it does give you a good steady progress of leveling and not overdoing it. i've played games for 10+ hours in a row because stamnia bars weren't included or implemented and end up blowing my entire day on a game. there is ways around it with events or the cash shop, but you don't have to push it. you'll normally spend up to 3 to 4 hours, at most, straight with grinding before you'll run out.consistent events:this is the only thing that curttails the whole cash cow complex of this game. you need to cash in on these events, especially if they give out some lucrative items (like stamnia potions or cash shop gear) throughout the duration. there is hardly any time where they don't have less than two events running at the same time.= - = - = negatives = - = - =cash cow / pay-2-win complex:this feature right here can kill a game, especially when it's tied into the game to hinder progress towards end game content. sure, the clothes may seem nice, but they come with stats and without those--you'll be spending countless hours trying to get around it. this has been a problem for not a few months, but years actually with little-to-no resolution. alongside, some of the things in the shop, especially with the gear, class rebalancing needed:many of the newer classes would end up being the trend, especially when someone's been apart of the game for a while. even if a nerf comes across, it takes many weeks to months before they actually resolve the overpowered class with a patch. i can't play some of my classes now, because they just fall off compared to newer classes.consistent repetitiveness:for the majority of the game, all you do is run into dungeons, kill things, and there you go. you can go out into the field and kill field bosses and trash mobs, but they don't give essential experience unlike what dungeons give you. this was a main killer of the game's attention towards me and end up quitting for weeks to months at an end.= - = - = verdict = - = - =i have to get it a negative rating barely because this game has hardly ever kept my attention for more than a week. don't get me wrong, this game is fun and all--yet, there's many mechanics in the game that either gets boring really quick or requires you to dump real-life cash to achieve end-game status. if you're a person that doesn't mind tossing some green around to get boosted into end-game, then by all means--go ahead. however, if you're a person that's barely making it paycheck-to-paycheck or don't have the money to toss around, then i highly don't recommend this game without putting limitations on purchasing things.",0

3821,"the premier online hat simulator, 2007 edition. if you are reading this and have never played this game, please don't start now. tf2 is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top. it has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics. it has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade. it has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)tf2 is as much a social platform as it is a video game. it's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics. there's also an fps minigame which i hear is occasionally populated. unfortunately, with the meet your match update in the summer of 2016, valve removed the quickplay function from tf2, killing off all community servers not named skial. now the landscape consists of 24/7 2fort, harvest, hightower and turbine. it's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.with mym valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers. the casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be. it's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory 60 second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game. player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason. tf2 still has huge balance issues. sniper, a poor fit for the game in 2007, is insanely un-fun to fight against 11 years later. there are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. the class needs a fundamental rework to remove the insta-kill all classes from any range mechanic. scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels. since 2016, medic runs at scout speed with any medi-gun, making scout completely dominant in 6s competitive. heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion. core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all. since 2014, heavy's minigun starts at 50% of its base damage. spy is both up and op at the same time. baguette now runs at medic speed, and faster than scout when he pops the dead ringer. valve nerfed the ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, valve overdid it by a factor of 2). they have left the diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.as of this writing, the big 3 tf2 cheats (the l word, the n word, and the c word) are all undetected. hackers are rampant in valve's competitive and casual modes, and there's plenty on the few populated community servers as well. the hasn't been a major vac ban wave in tf2 for all of 2018.all of this would be problematic but possibly understandable if valve were a small company keeping their game alive. the company is worth nearly 20 billion dollars at this point. half of that is in gaben's back pocket. there's like 5 dudes who work on tf2 (valve has claimed up to 16 at one point) and while i am sure they are working hard, they're very understaffed.valve's flat structure was a dumb idea 20 years ago, but the company did manage to produce many gems for their first decade. for the last 10 years, the company has grown hugely and made so much money they don't even know what it means to give a . the company's internal structure actively works to the detriment of the customers.if you're still reading and you've actually played this game, you know what i'm talking about. i'll see you on doublecross later this evening.",1

658,"dustforce truly is a work of art. i don't mean that lightly. the way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. i can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. the frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. the way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. they had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. in layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. they ditched that and added an xp system in which you gain more xp to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. i'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. but now that i did buy it, i do not regret it even for a second. one thing i really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. in a sense, this game is open world. that sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. to get an s in completion, you have to sweep up every leaf, and to get an s in finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. another thing i absolutely enjoy about dustforce is its expasive community. there are lots of community workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. i'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. the community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. it just depends on how much you want to play it), i rate this game:10/10buy this game.",1

2641,"a fun game on the whole but there are a number of issues with it--server sinc issues-payed tanks are over powered for their ranks-map fatigue-not all key functions are bound by default, meaning that some of the important keys that you will need are not bound from the start and you will have to explore to find them-cramped ui-random rewards are lack luster or outright uselesswith all of the negatives of the game it is actually really well supported by the developers with frequent updates, ever changing vehicles, and the ammount available only ever expands. the vehicles and mechanics are generally realistic, though some liberties have obviously been taken to make it more appealing but you will learn alot about mechanized warfare in the 21st century just by playing the game, and learning is always a good thing. for all of its faults, it really isnt a bad game.final sumation: if you are looking for a game to mindlessly dump hours into, yell at and scream when you get knocked out in the first three minutes of a match, and grind xp late into the night because you want a new tank, then this is a game you would probaly enjoy.update: since the recent update to warthunder there is an issue with aircraft balance. certain tank designs have either open tops, sides or are much less of a tank and more of an armored truck, are now overly suceptable to attacks by aircraft. there have been a great many times i have 'burned down' without taking any damage or having been in a fight. yet, a player who was flying an aircraft was credited for the kill. in non simulator modes of the game this is an unfortunate development as it seems to effect the game in a negative way. it is not glorifying to have an aircraft slam into you for a kill, nor is it rewarding to kamakazi your aircraft as soon as you get it. the purpous of flying aircraft is now redundant since you inevitably resort to dive bombing the enemy in a half hearted attempt to get a kill, but on the whole are attempting to return to the fight.",1

7191,"i played this game before it launched on steam. it's okay. it's 90% hearthstone with some new mechanics and faster ramp to mid-game. the promotion of cards (where cards you own get permanently impproved) feels like a mechanic that gives long-time players a serious edge over newcomers, which might be a problem in the future. but it's free and very generous in dispensing card packs, so there's very little to keep you from just trying it yourself.edit: after playing this game some more, i'm now of a mind to caution people about what they are getting into. i like the gameplay far more than i do hearthstone, as there is a lot more dynamic on the board through heavy removals and influencers. but i do agree that it is p2w, or at least as much as hearthstone is.once you get through the newbie ranks, you'll start hitting the opponents with more legendaries and promoted cards. some builds have more than 10 legendaries in them. and they are legendary for a reason. on the flip-side, the cost of crafting cards are the same as in hearthstone, while the chance of drawing a card is considerably less (tesl uses 50 card decks, so 1/50 at the start of the game). this means that crafted cards have less impact on a build and it will take longer to catch up to the people who decided to spend money on packs and exclusives (ie: cards you'll never get if you don't pay for them).i still enjoy the game and i hope you will too. it's just a shame that this balancing issue is woven so deeply into the business model of this game.",0

2764,"with my hours in this i beleive i can give a credible opinion on this game. i reccomend this game if you're planning on playing this game every once in a while, as with this games terrible grind system you won't be getting too far down the tech trees. i play both tanks and aircraft and it seems the balance goes down the drain the further you get and the matches get less and less enjoyable. planes are great, although the russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the players i it seems bring them into battle. i love american tech and vehicles so i primary them, and then the germans for both game modes and it from what i experience everything in the american lineup isn't as good as the others it's put up against - this is mostly directed for ground forces. a massive chunk of the earlier tree is made up of the m4 sherman type tanks and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tanks down the same tree facing tigers and panthers and broken t34 it becomes incredibly stale. now that i have 2 6.0 tanks going into battle is now a complete waste of time, i usually when i play ground forces get 4-5 kills per match but now i'm getting less than 300 rp and barely a single assist. my advice is to either 1: pay for premium/golden eagles to boost your way out of the terrible 5.7+ mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the factions until you hit that point. it, after hundreds of hours of work is incredibly dissappointing.",0

12385,i think this game is one to watch. it really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. a little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. the main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. in most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. but here you unlock new stuff by buying it. also the races them self are just against the clock. there is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards. so as i say i think this is one to keep an eye on as more content become available.,1

2155,"pretty standard game of that genre.you can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. what i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. you have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.the (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. but pricings of around 40 bucks for an armour set, around 10 bucks for headgears or currently up to 80 bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.all in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. it simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while.

(i've looked thoroughly for hacks)here's what's amazing about both of these. in minecraft you need all these mods and so on just to make the game look cool or decent to your tastes and those tastes hit home on your pc and/or laptop hard. this game runs smoothly, really smoothly there's some moment of minor lag (a lot to be honest) but it's incredibly small and not an issue (at least for me.) in minecraft if you want to travel faster you're screwed from the start to grind into things less you go the cheap way with a mod or two. here, i haven't even gotten passed iron ore and i can actually make teleporters. the ability to traverse land is amazing because of this, and if you buy the pro pack like i did, and i highly recommend it. if not for the glider, for the transportation ease, for the extra stamina, even bag space.. just go for travel luxury. the map isn't procedurial generated. it's not as massive as planetside 2 or minecraft. but it is huge. it'll take you the better part of an hour to get from edge to edge.biomes, diversity in mobs and difficulty curves to match, the feeling that you don't have to walk from edge to edge but can fast travel in teleporters. the game real has a lot of potential and is hitting home runs on everything. the game has a fair community, not a big one by any means. but they're there, 24/7 too and playing this game really stimulates you. it's minecraft on hard and easy mode. the mobs keep you on your toes, the progression system is absolutely brilliant and scales you into horror. got a pickaxe that's stone, congratz you can mine up into the next level no further. that simple stopping point is epic. it stops people from going in over their heads, being smart and gearing up for every mine shaft and cave they venture into. this game knows how to keep you on edge.extremely recommended!",1

8109,"after playing over 1000 hours of this game i can say: no dont download this game! the main issue on pc is the lack of good and new content; not redone old content, and unstable servers. the game is not pay to win at all; it's true that refinement items can be purchased through the cash shop but, if you try to purchase all the refinement items that you would need; you'd go broke! it costs so much to get anything in this game maxed out; you might aswell play the game and take your time. but that avalability of the items in the cash shop makes people (and by people i mean trolls and half-wits) a reason to spam in zone chat. it should also be said that the devs have done a good job working with what they have in the game; but after the masive bleed out after mod 5; no one was left to spend money on the game and keep it going on pc; but, now its on the xbone and they have some safety in revinue; alowing the pc to be the testing ground for new content. i do hope that the game would regain lost players and start growing once again but, this is just the hope of a long time player. if the devs ever do see this i have some words of advice; make new content of quality! it doesnt have to tie into a masive modle; it can just be a themed dungeon (like water, fire, air, or earth to tie into modle 6 or maybe raiding a massive bandit encampment if you want unrealated conent) with 3-4 bosses, some new loot, and even a random puzzle. just some end game content that feels new; you have a strong dev team that can pull content out of theirif they wanted to; even if you can make new textures you can reuse assets in new content, just aslong as we can have a new dungeon with new bosses and loot to run. this is what keeps players going new loot and more end game content. you could take a look at another game; path of exile, a game with one of the best cash shop intergrations ever. i cannont tell you how much i want transmogs for my gear. making your charicter look good is a very important thing. look at wow; people run dungeons from years ago for loot to transmog thier gear. if you dont want to add new loot because of balance but, want to add a new dungeon, just add in transmogs. thank you for reading this massive wall of text!",0

9915,"elsword... elsword.well there isnt much to saybut its your typical pay to win type of game, but what i like about this game is that you can gain some items by just ranking up and getting them from quests.the animation and visual effects of the game is pretty good too, does feel like a comic book in a way. the beat em up mechs works fine too, but they need to put more combos into the characters since x and z are the only buttons to hit for swinging a sword or wand. theres also specials, but you need to level them up for able to take critical damage from them. one problom i have with the game tho is the limited storage space they give you when it comes to your inventory, if you want extra space, you need to buy it. the pvp in the game is ok, but will tire out your fingers if your not used to quick doging, speaking of which, its a skill you have to unlock, you only near dogeing tatic is by jumping or running away.the players on elsword are mostly quiet, rarely do you find people talking to each other, but when you do, its a guild thats doing so or a group of hipsters.but the game is quite exciting and enjoyable to play for a few hours, at first, leveling up is simple, but when you reach level 25 and higher, it slows down. not to mention some quests or equipment require a level to play or use.if you dont spend any money on the game, you can still enjoy it, but prepare yourself on spending time clearing your inventory alot, since you gather items like crazy.i would give elsword a 8 out of 10",1
9044,"great first person shooter with massive maps and massive battles with potentially hundreds of players on each side. there are 3 factions: vanusovereignity, neoconglomerate and terrainrepublic. vs are sci-fi style with hovertank and plasma weapons. their weaponry is mixed. nc are mercenaries with gauss weapons. their main battletank is closest to normal tank. they have heavy emphasis towards shotguns. tr are the empire. they use regular weaponry and tend to have large clips on their weapons. their main battletank has 2 barrels. the best quality of ps2 is that its sandbox styled. you can do what ever you want. if you like to play with other people you can join someone's squad or start your own (quality of playing with squad depends on 75% leader and 25% members in my opinion). you can go solo and still be part of large battles, take potshots at the fringes or even infiltrate enemy bases and cause havoc there.planetside 2 is free to play, so you can use real money to buy stuff. however, everything that actually affects gameplay can be unlocked by playing within reasonable amount of time. you can trial any weapon for 1h per day. most weapons are sidegrades and most stock weapons are actually quite good. having large arsenal means that you can tackle wider variety of situations. i'd say ps2 is pay for convenience and pay for bling. this is a great incentive to actually buy their stuff and support the continued existence of planetside 2.",1
8270,"just started this game today and to be honest i wasn't really impressed. so far it's not really a bad game per say, it's just it seems so... dull for me. the action combat isn't all that actiony. not like other games such as dragon nest or tera.for me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. neverwinter simply did not thrill me. i dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. what is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? combat seems very clunky. i stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, it's just not for me.on top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily pay2win as levels progress. while i may not have witnessed this first hand, i have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. boss mechanics consist of mostly cone / aoe then spawn adds. repeat process as difficulty increases. really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. check youtube videos, it's obvious.don't get me wrong, while i may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put me off from the game. there are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. while it's obviously harder for them, if you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. it's just annoying how much of an advantage paying does give you. overall i think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an equal f2p experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else.",0

8261,"note: the review has been updated to include the campaigns content.neverwinter is an mmo by perfect world entertainment. this allows us to predict two things:1. the amount of cash required will be huge.2. the classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual d&d races, and have a choice of class. this confirms suspicion in that there is the devout cleric (healer) guardian fighter (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).you'll have an option between the control wizard which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very squishy. the main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.the great weapons fighter which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. standard front-line damage-dealer. this class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.the trickster rogue who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. this class's main job is to kill the bosses.the hunter ranger who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. the hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. the skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.combat is simple in this game: you have two at will attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.you then have three encounter skills, which are basically active skills. mapped to qer by default.lastly, you have a daily power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of action points which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and i assume tanks block or absorb damage (though i haven't made one to confirm it). these could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to 1 and 2 by default.there's the feat system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.and then there's the two active passives slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not feats (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.you can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.equipment is your standard mmo system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):-white common basic equipment.-green uncommon equipment.-blue rare equipment.-purple epic equipment.-orange (?).purple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level 60 dungeons, while tier 2 is obtained from more difficult level 60 dungeons.so far, so standard. where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in diablo), and those have several ranks. you can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a 1% success rate at level 8 (rank 10 is the highest).if you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.well, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.i should probably mention the artifact system. these are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. the primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.each player gets one at level 21 in a bind on equip state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. this bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.the game features a companion system. free players get a white one, which can reach rank 15 (equivalent to player level 30). for 25$, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank 30 (equivalent to player level 60).bag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. the large bag costs (24 slots) 10$.storage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.pvp exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.one-hit-kills are fairly frequent.story-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear r.a. salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. the entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.the writing is what you can expect from salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of satan and hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).the campaigns which i mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require astral diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.unfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to pvp.and, of course, i saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called astral diamonds. you receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in pvp) in a rough form, and must refine them in order to use them. the currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.astral diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).now, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. it costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. that is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. you can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.to top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous perfect world entertainment support is just worthless.so, over-all, would i recommand this game?well, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.otherwise, no, i'm afraid i can't recommand it.",0

10087,"i've been playing the free version since 2009 when my pc could barely run it. now i've got a much beefier pc and decided to take the plunge and buy a membership. $54(cad) for the trailrunner starter pack (best deal imo) gives you a very nice selection of weapons/equipment, and all licenses for a year.all i can say is wow. i'm not dissappointed at all with my purchase. i love the fact that this game is 6 years old and still amazing. at first i wasn't a fan of the whole pay-to-play sales model, but i completely understand why the dev's did it that way.if this game was a buy once and keep playing type of game it would have been released in 2009, and stayed in basically the same shape it was is at the time of release.instead, we've got a game that is constantly being updated, even 6 years after it's initial release, and that's due to the fact that the devs are still seeing an income from the game, which allows them to spend time/resourses updating it, and adding fresh new content, as well as fix bugs and add new features over time.in my opinion, that makes it worth the $34(cad) i need to keep paying in order to hunt all the animals after my licenses expire.don't get me wrong, if i decide to not pay next year, i can still keep all of the weapons/equipment that came with my initial purchase and use them to hunt mule deer and cottontails (i believe those are the only free animals), but i will definitely be buying my licenses again next year.i would even consider buying a higher priced lifetime license if the devs ever thought to release something like that, but i understand why they decided to go with the current business model.now, if only they would do something similar with thehunter:primal so it could be anywhere close to as amazing of a game as this is.",1

12975,"it's... okay.it fits solidly in the catagory of being a waiting game with options to pay to get things done quicker. nothing is impossible to get without paying for it though. and - if complaints made in the discussion threads are true - paying for things is risky since it's completely possible it'll just take your money and not give you what you paid for. but again there's no reason to pay for it. the game is pretty generous on giving you ample lunchboxes (chests of rare loot) and nuka colas (items used to speed up wait times) for free on quests and for accomplishing achievements.the s.p.e.c.i.a.l. stats are not what they are in other games. when it comes to combat the endurance (hp) and agility (attack rate) stats are the only factors. combat is pretty much a watch the characters do all the work automatically thing while you give them a stimpack or radaway when needed. the closest thing you get to any tactical decisions is whether or not you'll use a charged-up critical attack now or save it for later in case it's needed. that's it.as a fallout franchise fan myself i wanted to dabble with it a little. it pokes at my nostalgia. i see a lot of familier weapons and armors from the games. it feels like someone that didn't actually play much of fallout made it. they may have peeked at the wiki, looked at some screenshots, talked to the devs, ect but they weren't likely actual fans of the series themselves. there were just too many thats not how it works moments. which brings me to...lore nitpicksvaults, in fallout shelter, send out radio signals to add to their population. in any other fallout game vaults are pretty xenophobic. other vaults seem much more happy to see your dwellers visit than they ought to as well. to put this into the realistic light: in fallout 1 you are sent out of your vault to find a water chip. you save your vault eventually - as well as potentially other places depending how you play. but the overseer abandons you because you've been outside of the vault too long and are deemed an outsider for that alone. your character is left outside to what the overseer can only assume will be your death. fallout 3's overseer was even worse.deathclaws appear in packs similar to molerats or radroaches. in any other version of this series when you get a whiff of a single deathclaw you're on high alert. in this case however you brawl through 10 of them to get through a room. this game failed so hard on what makes a deathclaw a deathclaw.in some quests feral ghouls talk to the vault dwellers. feral ghouls; the ones that have rotted out minds and are completely senseless zombies that just scream and growl and attack anything with flesh.the vault door - the big iconic cog-shaped door - responsible for holding off the explosion of a nuclear bomb and protect the residents from outside danger falls apart during raider attacks as though it's made of paper mache. typically about 3 hits with a sword tears a hole right through it - i don't mean they knock the door down. i mean they rip right through it.conclusionit's oddly addictive. it's free even if it's an obvious cash grab. it's okay as a time killer or as a game that you might play on the side while doing something else - like reading or youtube. it's nothing great though. even the guys that made this game probably don't like it enough to play or update it.",1

10527,"thehunter - this review is designed to eliminate the stress of playing without knowledge of the game from first hand encounters.lets get this out of the way first.q: what is thehunter?a: thehunter is not just a game its a hunting simulation. yes a simulation.w: if you want to run around and shoot whatever moves, this is not the game for you. if your looking for freebies and handouts, this is not the game for you. if you want free stuff then you need to earn it. if you are a kid, and momma wont buy you anything, then this is not the game for you. if your stingy and dont want to spend a few bucks go back to wow and waste ur life. lastly, playing the game is free, and you can play as much as you like. if you want to play more than what you start with, then get a bundle package. (more details below)q: does it cost anything to play?a: no!h: however, the developers have made the game available to you for free. this is not a free trial. it is the complete game. you can hunt 2 species right from the start as long as you want forever. their business model is genius, if you like what you see and want more you can pay them for it.q: what does it cost if i want more?a: well it depends. the bundle deals are probably a steal on our part, their pricing is ultra low. avgs 3-4 dollars per month for unlimited access to the game(kill anything). memberships are based on 3-6-12 month packages. their bundles are the same however the perks to a bundle are priceless when compared to manually purchasing them in the shop.o: okay now, the important things to discuss. if you read any negative reviews (several) your more than likely to find its a ripoff its not free devs suck. well truth be told, your all a bunch of idiots. this isnt just a game, it is a simulation. simulation as close to reality as you can get being virtual. the game aspects are what create more playable attractions. ex: competitions, tracking, spotting levels. leaderboards, animal scoring system. personal achievments. etc.if you want to know what the game is like then i will give you the best review i possibly can honestly and in detail. honestly speaking im very dissapointed in the reviews that dont justify their responses. it royally pisses me off.my reviewhunting in its natural form requires patience, and understanding the behavioral patterns of your prey and overall, the ability to learn from your mistakes.from the start (guest non-member)as a guest or non-member you can create single player games and hunt loggers point reserve. here you will find mule deer, whitetail, rabbit, ferral hog, pheasant. guests are authorized to hunt rabbit and mule deer by default. you can continuously hunt them to your hearts content. (one blunder the devs did was make default rifle non compliant with rabbit hunting, whether this was intended or not should be fixed, its a turn off and negative review maker)when you create your game prior to starting you can choose where you want to start on the map, after doing so the game loads etc.1. right from the start its very important to realize that the game feels slow and characters are slow. no this is a hunting game, not call of freakin duty. slow and quiet is the game, and probly the most widely contributed negative review aspect. there is no animals to shoot, i run around for hours and cant find anything what a waste if you have seen a review like this then read the following.2. the ai in the game are astonishing, they simulate an emense amount of realism in the animals. slow and quiet when you stand up and walk around your a beacon to the world of animals. so crouch and move slow. the animals get spooked by 3 factores. movement, sound, and smell. by default your character is ugly, smells, and loud as ...3. the game takes time to understand, you need to put in the time to learn terrain the animals, and their patterns. when you start a new game and you go back to the spot you killed that monster buck, chances are they wont be there anymore. the ai is smart, the animals in the game actually avoid overly hunted areas. pathfinding actually changes for the animals. if the devs did this on purpose, then kudos, if not your some lucky mofo's. 4. i had to put in some long hours to actually figure how to find the animals. it sucked, and i hated it i was one of those rage quitters. then a friend of mine took me on an actual hunt. as a guest you can join multiplayer games and hunt every map/reservere. just be mindful of the liscenses you carry. anyway, what i learned in that single hour of hunting with my friend, forever changed my opinion of this game.5. when you play for the first time, expect to get frustrated if you dont actually have real life hunting habits. you will be inclined to run everywhere dont! you will spook animals and never see them. try to find a game with a host that has a high hunter score. ask them to show you, or take you on a hunt. once you learn the tricks, the game becomes exciting and fun.6. this is very important. you have been hunting mule deer for hours, now your bored. you want to kill something else. but you dont want to pay for a subscription...you can earn em$ (cash currency) by doing surveys and tasks etc from thehunter website. with em$ you can buy other liscenses in the form of 1-7-28 days. guess what now you dont have to spend your money. you can also purchase gear, weapons, etc.this game is intimidating, i usually open my games to guests and help them out. i fully understand why people do negative reviews.guys/girls this game is amazing in the aspect of what it was meant for. if you have patiencea little bit of time to spendand willing to spend a few bucksyou will not be dissapointed.i recommend this to any hunter enthusiast.",1

15675,"note: this is a review on the steam version of the game and how i feel the game from a pc perspective and not a mobile perspective. there is no difference from the steam version and the mobile version but there are some things that look good on a phone or tablet but not so much on the pc. if this was a review on the mobile version then i would definitetly recommend this game.now as the game is still open beta, there are many things to be added and polished on (like levels, maps, shops etc) so i can't talk about the lack of content but instead i will mention the things that i feel are weird in the pc or things that should be added or modified.the ui - it shouldn't come to a suprise that when you make a cross platform game between pc and mobile, there are gonna have to be corners cut. in this case its the ui. on mobile, the ui looks great and makes sense but on the pc, it just looks cheap and unclean. preferably if possible, adding an option to switch between tablet ui and pc ui would be amazing. the ui also lacks alot of small yet needed details like specific hp, mp, and xp numbers.friends/party system - while there is an friends list system, there is no party system. you can use the summon code (which is a bit buggy at times. i was stuck in loading) to play on the same channel/map but there isn't a real party system. so you can't see their hp/mp bar without clicking on them. this may not be as big as a problem now but in the future when there are healer classes, it would be extremely difficult to play as you can't attack a monster while keeping tabs on your friends hp at the same time.weapons/classes/stats - there are 4 main stats in the game; hp, mp, attack, and defense. the class you have on only affect your skills and nothing else. daggers gives the most attack of all the weapons, staffs give the most mp, and swords give the most defense. here's the problem. all the classes are equally tanky. i have played all the classes besides guardian and i have noticed little to no difference in survivability. being tanky isn't going to help when you're playing a rogue or mage because that's not what they do, and warriors are suppose to be tanky, but do a bad job at it because there are no skills to help him be tanky. in fact, i would say mage and rogue are more tanky because they have defensive skills (mana sheild and stealth). this makes attack the most valuable stat for doing the most damage. aqw was really customizable because there was no restriction on what weapon you could use. you could be a mage and use a hammer, but this only worked because every weapons attack stats were the same and the attack stats are mainly determined by the enchant. in aq3d, each weapon has different stats. attack determines how much damage you do, and that's the only real stat you should be going for as rogue or mage. even warriors should build this over defense tbh. daggers have the highest attack making the daggers the only viable weapon to use for high dps. this takes away a lot of customization (plus it looks weird for a mage to use a dagger as a weapon). some solutions to this would be adding more stats (like luk for rogues and int for mages) or making it like aqw where all weapons have equal damage and the stat's are based off enchants.again, this game is still in beta so it is expected to be some flaws but there is a lot of potential in this game. with some things added and polished, i can see this being a very fun game",0

9757,"tl;dr: this game is really good. for a dynamic and enggaging combt system, a less-than-toxic community, and an overall good time, i recommend this game.if you're like me, and you enjoy an mmo experience but hate repetitive combat with no real fun or purpose, then you should give this game a try. there is a huge amount of fun to be had in this game! many mmo traditions are thrown out in favor of creating engaging, dynamic combat.for starters, elsword takes an entirely different approach to how it is played by using a side-scrolling beat-'em-up format. by removing the average open world gameplay, and instead using this format, the game has an easy time creating a fun combat system. if one wanted to, they could forget all about the mmo aspect of the game, as it is never overbearing about player interaction, and is more about combat and leveling up.speaking of leveling, the playable characters in this game are done pretty well. like some other mmos, this game lacks a true character creation menu, and instead provides several premade characters with their own moves, special attacks, and fleshed-out stories. while this may sound restricting, this was never a problem for me. all of the chracters look really cool, and each character brings an entirely new playstyle to the table.plus, there is a chracter progression system, in which you are able to access new special attacks and combos at certain levels. at level 15, you are able to choose a new class for your character. the class you choose can drastically change how you play, and leads into another class progression later on. a lot of the draw for playing new characters comes from this system. i spent hours just figuring out which character to play, and how they'd help my friends in combat.this is, however, an mmo, so how are the other players? well... i never really noticed them. no one ever bothered me, which is nice. you will likely only encounter other active players in the bigger towns, and occasionally in the battlefield. you can choose whether to involve yourself in that sort of thing; i personally chose to stick with my current friends. i'll say this: the community for this game is unobtrusive, and will not bother you unless you choose to be a part of it.overall, i enjoy this game thoroughly. at the time of writing, the season 2 update just came out, adding upgrades and such to elsword (the character) and rena. i just hope that they game's creators will do something similar for all characters, as that would be a fun sight to see.11/10 would spend too much time on this review again.",1

8080,"this game came into my attention sometime ago. me, having spent my chilhood playing neverwinter nights, was one of the many, many people who gave this a try, out of pure nostalgia.i ran into problems at the level of downloading the game, though. steam only allows you to download the launcher, which then proceeds to leech the 5gb of this game from the developer's site. which takes five hours. i wouldn't complain much about it if this game wasn't on steam anyway. why can't you just download the whole game from steam, especially considering it's far superior it terms of download speed (team fortress 2, 12gb, downloaded in maybe over an hour)? this question still bugs me even now.first things first: this is (supposed to be) based on the 4th edition of d&d. i am not a specialist on this topic, but it seems to be very, very different from older editions - definitely more so than the 3rd edition differences from 2nd. apparently, somewhere along the way, clerics lost the ability to carry heavy armor and use shields and even normal weapons - instead, they run around with magical symbols which they basically just hold up and channel divine power or something like that on top of not being able to actually heal stuff directly (their first heals are drain and regen-based), sword-and-shield and two-handed-weapon warriors were differentiated, rogues learned to flash step, and wizards taught themselves how to cast spells while wearing armor. this is as utterly unfamiliar to anyone used to nwn and 3rd edition as it sounds.in the race department, we get basically what we would expect from a typical d&d game: humans, elves, halfelves, dwarves, halflings, and halforcs, with tieflings as an added bonus. also, the game differentiates three different subraces of elves (sun elves, wood elves and drows). nothing out of ordinary here, to be honest. however, it disappoints us when we get to the available classes: we get only cleric, wizard, rogue, ranger and two types of warrior (offensive and defensive varieties). even the 2nd edition had more options, such as paladins or druids.in terms of gameplay, other than your typical feats, we get three different types of powers: at-will, encounter and daily. at-will is basically your standard swing sword to deal damage or shoot magical bullets to deal damage things that can be spammed over and over. your basic attacks, putting it simply. encounter powers have cooldowns and are more powerful than at-will. finally, dailies - no, it's not a viariation on ff11's two-hours. it's more akin to weaponskills: you hit stuff, a gauge charges up, when it's full you unleash a ridiculously powerful attack at the cost of the whole gauge. how do you fill it? either by dealing damage or doing class-specific actions (such as healing for clerics). it's nothing really special, but it works and fighting stuff is fun. the game frequently throws dungeons your way, too, which usually end in boss fights, and are definitely a breath of fresh air - instead of beating up stuff on the surface, you beat up stuff underground. powerful attacks from bosses are highlighted in red on the ground before they hit - pressing a direction twice causes you to slide and dodge any attacks. this makes it slightly more action-rpg-oriented than other games like that. slightly. speaking of the bosses, the fights can be pretty much summarized with hit the boss a lot of times, watch as it summons more minions and either deal with them or ignore them, dodge the occasional powerful highlighted-and-telegraphed attack, heal if you must, hit them some more. it just lacks the technicality and complexity of a d&d game.in terms of storyline, well... our character, besides more-or-less stupid questions, doesn't really get any development. i know this is a mmo, but come on, it's named after one of the best crpg series and systems ever made. you'd expect something more than an evil old woman who has evil overlord list violations up the ante as a main villain.this game is also, well, allegedly free. you can play just fine, but other than the standard box that has to be opened by a key bought with real money shticks, you also have to shell out if you want to get the strongest equipment and enchantments on it. a lot of games today take this approach, being seemingly f2p but filled with occassions where you can shell out to upgrade. for example, you can't create more than two characters without buying additional slots. two characters. even by character slot limitation standards, this is just absurd.the last, and most important thing to mention: this game takes place 100 years after neverwinter nights. somewhere along that time span, there was a spellplague that basically caused the whole neverwinter to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, much like warsaw after the 2nd world war. i repeat: the neverwinter we all know and love is dead. instead of a great story-driven crpg with good fights and character development, we get yet another more-or-less generic mmo, which doesn't really do much to its originality besides carrying the names of neverwinter and d&d.i don't recommend this to neither d&d fans, nor neverwinter nights fans. both of those kinds of players are going to be utterly disappointed in this. that isn't to say this game isn't playable, or fun, for that matter. i would probably look at it from a different perspective if it wasn't named after nwn or anything related to d&d.",0

15943,"you'll probably only like this game if you enjoyed aqw. the exp curve is terrible, even if it's supposed to compensate for the low level cap. you'll get to the point where if you want to level up, you'll have to grind certain dungeons a bunch of times, not to mention that they give far less exp than story missions (which you probably can't do if you are grinding the dungeons for exp in the first place).the graphics are nice, with it being capped at 60 fps. everything has good brightness (loving me that bloom). i'm also glad that there's actually sound effects in this game. that spawn-in sound effect is kind of annoying, though.now, the controls are a bit wonky. realistically, no one is going to be comfortable with strafing their character and turning with the same hand. you can control the camera with the mouse, but doing so while moving just makes the camera snap back to its original position, making it a pain to use in combat. controls would be fine if that was fixed.",1

( that explains the time i have in it ) after looking at the store i came to notice that this game is pay to win, and then i uninstalled it. i wouldnt recomend this game, unless it was bill gates, because he could afford to buy all of the crap that in any other game, you would purchase with ingame money",0

6957,"so i don't write reviews. not usually. anyways, i found this little gem about a week ago and so far i have 28 or so hours on it. it is f2p and although you can buy packs and advance faster in story to get more cards it is not p2w game and you can easilt and with good strategy take out someone who paid money.the only problem is that sometime you get into a pvp battle where the combination of cards on the other side is just ridiculously stupid and you get you behind handed to you on a platinum platter.overall, fairly easy to get cards either from purchasing with gold, finishng quests, ranking, leveling... and crafting too.i find it to be a fun game and the part that you can build from two different type of cards + hybrid cards + colorless cards is great.also, i have not seen the same deck playing against me and there are so many ways and deck building ideas to try that it really helps the game moving on even after so many hours. the decks are of at least 50 cards and you get to play about 20-30 in a normal match so although you can get great combos, it is more about adjusting rather than oh yeah i do 1,2,3 and thats it.also the fact that there are two lanes to play is great and cool.my opponent got a card that let him play a card if his hp was greater than mine, he pooled the same card that left him play a card that made the next card cost 6 less mana and got demolished the next turn. 11/10 will do that again just.",1

8883,"--the following review is from a vs heavy assault main, no other /classes/ except max are used by me.~~this was the very first game where i started to use mouse & keyboard, oddly being plonked right into esamir bio-labs (no tutorial world for me :c) under new conglomerate assault. this was where i realized three things: a) my aim sucked. b) i am not john rambo. c) what the f**k, that's unfair, i shot him first! after a quick revision of tactics, a class change and using cover more often i gradually got a lot better, sticking with my team and trying to be the main focus of enemy fire without dropping. this was where i started to like the game a little more since i was so used to playing more laid back fps- not 98+ blue-guys-purple-guys-who-the-f**k-is-on-my-team fps's.graphics.amazing, lovely game visually when there aren't nineteen snipers trying to pick you off. i've not seen the graphics on any other setting other than its max, but i'm sure it looks pretty on any. but graphics isn't why i love the game. gameplay.the vehicles are designed extremely well, each faction even has their own respective strengths and weaknesses that a player can use with their playstyle. the weapons are different also for each faction with their respective strong points, no bullet drop, faster rate of fire etc. with each weapon comes their modifications, scopes, silencers etc. the game runs smooth, when i shot an enemy it actually hits the enemy. i've had no reason period to complain over stupidly large hit-boxes. vehicles are balanced and unlike most other games they don't suck b***s when someone pulls out their lock-on.the warzone.beautifully designed, complex and various environments that have you changing your tactics or stalling your teams push- for example a push toward the biolabs in vehicles can go stagnant with the actual assault on the biolab due to max's being your only real support. if you like being part of a huge assault force this game is for you. i still suffer from who-to-shoot-first syndrome and shoot all three targets to get no kill- i'm getting better.what i hate:i'll edit this out if i find a way to change it or get good, but i hate how aircraft are piloted. that's about it.tl;dr, if you like big fps fights where teamwork is key, planetside 2 is the game.oh, don't think the medics are any brainier than battlefield medics when it comes to reviving you.",1

15824,"steam says 1.3 hours, but i have more than that on mobile version.game is absolutely terrible and the devs have no intention of changing it. i've been involved with artix entertainment games for more than half my life and know this companies intentions for its consumers. they are only about your money using micro-transactions!as of writing this review, the game is in open beta and the game feels like it's still in mid-late alpha. problems - quest are just simplistic. there are truly only 3-4 quest in aq3d: kill x mob, kill boss, and touch/collect something. for the kill quest, you will run into this type of quest ~70% of the time for each zone where you will kill the same 2-3 monsters over and over, and over again. - crafting is one of the main source of getting equipment and gear. you collect resources and gear to make the equipment. except, you can completely bypass collecting materials and resources by buying it with money using the 2nd currency, dragon crystals. yes, you can buy equipment to get strong by spending money - the game was released into open beta in an atrocious state. graphical glitches, attack commands not working, monsters bugged out on map, monsters that are meant to be melee can attack you with ranged because the game thinks you are in melee range, and a lot more that will become an essay if typed out.- artix entertainment is fueled by fanboys. ttheir games have multiple currencies that make obtaining items easier and allow you to progress faster. all your hardwork will go to waste knowing someone can just throw money at artix entertainment and get everything they want.- you can buy health, mana, and experience potions with the 2nd currency, dragon crystals. enough said. with their micro-transactions, you can expect to never collect everything in the game. if you do, you will end up spending hundreds of dollars a month. tl:dr: terrible business model, artix entertainment's game are all laced with heavy micro-transactions, and avoid this company and its games at all cost.",0

13540,"for a game called creativerse, the amount of things you can do is lacking in creativity. granted, this game hasn't been out that long, but the community that makes it more fun to play is almost dead, hardly any players ever on any public world. the updates are tiny, and usually only tweak already existing blocks - which imo, the variety designs themselves are lacking. if you don't have a giant simplistic design in mind, you probably won't have much fun with this game. wood only comes in one color unless you count the logs themselves, some of the blocks are practically useless as decor because they are either meant for crafting recipes or they are natural blocks. and if you want any variety at all, you'll have to pay for it.thee art style is wonderful, i thuroughly enjoy the graphics of this game, i just wish there was more to the game than what's there. i've experienced no bugs in the past 2 years or so i've played this game. i think i got this game because i could see the potential, but the updates are tiny and insignificant to me and the fact that you can't mod the game to at least relieve some of that blandness, is a huge put off. i'd reccomend this to a 5 yo. but not an adult who needs a bit more stimulation.",0

8751,"okay, review time:pros: rpg elements in a battle royale, and while still in early access already has lots of contents and ways to keep you playing and entertained for hours, specially with friends, it makes possible for lots of fun and cool moments with your most dearest friendscons: as of now there are just a few true cons in my opinion, those being some achievements being unable to achieve due to the disabling of the engineer class, so for completionists like me it tends to bother a little, same goes for the assassin being the only one without a skin to buy without cash in the store as of now, the shotgun ultra low range for stated damage, and the sniper gun shot falling, other than those there are just a few map bugs while still in early access but those probably will be patched soon.if i would give an advice to the devs: as you made skins for characters, if possible inside that selection, create other selections for weapons, so we can have weapons skins, something cool like the dead space hand cannon per example would make for a more entertaining game. if the value of skins lower or the in-game money increases, you could make the store a lot bigger with those options, making for a variety of customs, like true peasants in a realm, which would make more entertaining for people i suppose, so if i had an advice it would be to focus in variety to keep players having an goal of getting that so desired item. cause as of now, with 150-200 hours ingame which you can get in about 3 weeks to a month like i did, you are able to get all items and if you are good enough, get to master elo in all categories like me. which turns the game a little purposeless, so give more objetives to the players other than daily missions only for money.but for now considering it is still in early access, the game feels and looks awesome, you are even able to play it on a integrated graphics card (intel hd 530) with no lag whatsoever. highly optimized which is great.so for me, tldr; i highly recommend it.",1

2802,"i have played this game for five years, and i must say to never ever download this game. ever since more premium vehicles have been added gaijin seems to only care about money. not only is the community of this game actually garbage, but they seem to only focus on certain tech trees and pertain to buffing them at all costs. recently in update 1.79 gaijin seemed to have added more prmium vehicles and interesting armor features. the intelligent members of the community saw this as a money grab and a distraction for the lemmings in the community. rather than fix in game issues gaijin added a shiny new vehicle and some cool features deriving from the much needed balencing issues and the other numerous issues this game is plagued with. basically putting a nice finish on a pile of four years ago i chose the soviet union for ground realistic battles. i had been grinding on the tech tree up until today 6/13/18 when i discovered something horrid. the object 906 had been moved to 8.0. incase who ever is reading this does not know, the object 906 is a modification to the pt-76 made by the soviet union in 1963 in order to modernize it. in game it has an armor piercing capped balistic capped shell that has decent if not good performance and a good high explosive anti tank shell. the only issue is the battle rating. at the battle rating of 8.0 the 906 goes against vehicles such as the leopard 1, the leopard a1a1 (with apds), the cheiftan mk3, the stb 1, and the american tanks which are of no issue. with all of these excellente vehicles combined it equals a bad time for the 906 which can barely pen all of these vehicles and has a 12k repair cost in game currency and a heaty heat shell expense. the icing on all of this is the fact that the battle rating before (7.3) was perfect for the tank. not only was it the only playable tank at that battle rating but it fought tanks that were in the same class at the same time. the only issue was the fact that a down tier would cause a massive problem as it out classed everything at 6.7. 7.7 was if not the perfect battle rating had the leopard not had the ability to instantly kill the 906 with heat because of hull break (yet another issue this game has). i have spent four years of my life for a tank that is completly useless. avoid this game if you value your time and money.",0

10576,"edit2: i am again updating this review, since i think the game has changed somewhat since my last one:after a season of imbalance and a meta which became so stale it was virtually reeking, a new expansion brought a fresh breeze into the entire game again, shaking up some things, while strengthening its core of infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game as they write it themselves. with the introduction of the fall of argenport (i think it actually has a decent lore, though this is not the main point), the developers managed to rebalance a lot of the game, offering new possibilities for deckbuilding and making a wider, more interesting veriety of decks viable, which gives me the feeling, that it now reached its best state yet. this is the main reason i feel very positive about recommending it (again).however, i am aware, that the ongoing expansions come at the increasing cost of accessibility for new players, because it needs more and more investment either in time or money to get the cards you want, as well as becoming more difficult/ needing more experience to understand which cards may benefit your decks more - though this is basically true for any ccg. so i am wondering, how this will be addressed in the future and where the game as a whole might still go from here.edit1: i was dissapointed for a while that, while a couple of updates brought changes, they didn't seem to address some of the major flaws of the game. this changed with the recent update (1.18.2), as they implemented a counter measure to the infamous mana-screw/ mana-flood problem and they even expressed some thoughts on their approach. so, while i still think that more can be done, the devs have proven that they listen and try to respond, which i think is a good reason for further recommendation.it's the younger, sexier cousin of magicin short, eternal is a must try for every digital ccg enthusiast and i think there's no reason for others not to try it as well. i bet, or at least hope a lot of people will get hooked by it.the strengths of eternal probably aren't the graphics or sound, they're decent enough, it looks nice and the sound probably won't hurt your ears, though i've muted it for the sake of my own music after little time and it could look a little better or worse, i think it wouldn't make much of a difference, because those aren't the core of eternal's experience. i'd say, that's where the mechanics and accessibility of the game are.the comparison of eternal to magic: the gathering definitely isn't farfetched. i've very actively played magic for a couple of years some time ago and when i first played eternal i immediately felt at home - which is not at all surprising, since the devs are magic-players as well. many mechanics are similar: the turn structure is almost the same, mana is called power, there's flying, trample is called overwhelm, haste is charge and there are many more in slight variations. so, if you really don't like magic, you might not like eternal, but i'd say you should still try, considering eternal kind of looks and feels like the younger, sexier cousin of magic, who offers some moves which feel familiar, but a bit different at the same time and who promises improvement during joyful consenting playtime, where magic might feel like it's trying too hard to impress, just to grab your money.the whole structure of the game often makes it feel a little slower than other recent ccgs and the resource mechanic can lead to frustrating bottlenecks in play if you heavily draw against the odds, but on the other hand i'd say there are a lot more possibilities to combo and build various decks with interesting strategies. i think it is rather well balanced, though there are certain cards which result in hefty power spikes and some i'd consider useless (as is often the case in most ccgs). but there is no card, deck, or strategy which can't be beaten by others, the game usually isn't decided in just a couple of turns and every turnaround can feel satisfying.and, as rarely as it happens, i'd actually consider this game free to play, as you not only can get everything the game has to offer without paying anything, the rate at which you gain cards is actually pretty good, i'd say generous, which makes it possible to get strong/ tier 1 decks relatively fast and to experiment often.and, well, if the current mass of positive reviews haven't convinced you to try and you haven't turned your back already because you hate ccgs in general, i honestly don't know what will change your mind.",1

5436,"this is a fun game. can be a little unbalanced at times, and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team. but it is fast paced, within only a day of game time i've already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank. i think this game has alot of potential.edit: after a few days of grinding i think its only fair to update my review.first off, the teams are rarely useful, tier iv tanks are also rarely useful. i cant tell you how many matches i've played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself, which only dooms your team. and dont even get me started on the huge gap between tier iv and tier v tanks. at leas in tier i - iv you can damage the enemy, i've played the german, japanese, and american skill tree (working on the russians now) and i can tell you tier v's are way too over armored, even using premium ammo i only damage them maybe 1 out of ever 6 shots. and its never enough to actually contribute.grinding in this game to get from tier iv to tier v means you join as many battles as you can and watch your win ration slowly go down. earning a mear 150 to 200 xp per match until you have the staggering 15k xp it takes to research a tier v... with all that said, tier i - iii is super fun and usually fairly balanced. i still see potential in this game.",1

4286,"i really enjoyed this game but...i leveled up most characters to 40 and has quite some meta decks(fenix, control, ancient gear, toon, burn, mill), but then after 5 months playing this game i realized how pay to win it has become. well, let me explain:at first, you enjoy beating npcs, collecting cards from events, leveling and unlocking new characters, but when you play for months(mid game) you have to put a goal, so you go to pvp and then the trolling begins. everybody using op cards from the store or troll decks, it makes anyone stressed losing to someone trolling you(cyber stein, mill, burn) or someone who has the new meta deck released last week. there are a lot of boxes from the store and konami keeps releasing every month(tons of new cards), so it makes the mid/late game an endless effort to get all the new cards and make new meta decks to get king of games or even platinum ranking.it gets very frustating to see other people spending thousand of bucks to get 3 copies of each card and when they come dueling there goes all the fun.also, ranking up is very hard, because even if you have a meta deck,for example, if you win 2 in a row and then lose and keeping looping that you never get promoted, most of the times you have to get 3+ wins to get something going.with all those paid to win decks no wonder you will get easily countered in a match screwing up all your chances of getting a higher ranking, of course.last thing to comment is if you wanna play this game, then google cyber angel duel links and see how balanced this game is...",0

12208,"i am going to ignore all the technical issues with the game for this review for those things could be fixed.the combat in bless is garbage for lack of a better term. it was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is. there are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion...yet there is no such fun mobile movement in bless. there's no dodge, there's no blocking, no teleporting, nothing, you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion. (the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of 35 seconds!) beyond the combat: bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. you kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. so, bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. also, as i'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. people in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different mmo in a language you don't understand. gear: initially (for the first 30 levels, as far as i was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) easily the worst mmo i've ever played. most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend 40 dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.",0

4217,"for new playersyu-gi-oh! duel links is a free-to-play, digital collectible card game developed by konami for ios, android, and now pc. saves/profiles transfer across all platforms.the game was first released in japan in november of 2016 and worldwide on january of 2017.duel links features characters from the yu-gi-oh! duel monsters anime. seto kaiba has created a virtual reality duel world in order to gather the best duelists so they can compete. players first have the option to play as either yami yugi or seto kaiba. as they continue to win duels, other characters become unlocked. duel world is the hub area where a character can be selected and challenge either a standard duelist or legendary duelist to obtain cards and increase the character's level. it is possible to increase the stage level by doing missions, and by doing so, a new legendary duelist or new features will appear.the game features cards and characters from mostly the 1st-3rd seasons of the anime, with gx being the most recent. pendulm and synchro have not yet been implemented, but have been datamined.in online versus mode, it allows real time duels with other duelists or friends around the world. furthermore, there are practice plays, decks from duelists played against, and replays from other duelists can be watched.the game does not follow the same rules as the tcg, but instead, more of a speed format. it was designed for mobile and meant to be quick ~5 minute matches. the changes are as follows:each player only has three monster zones and three spell & trap zones, rather than five of each.each player must have 20-30 cards in their main deck (instead of 40-60) and 0-5 cards in the extra deck (instead of 0-15).each player starts with 4000 lp, rather than 8000 lp.each player starts with four cards in their hand, rather than five.there is no main phase 2. the end phase takes place right after the battle phase.each player can have one skill. the available skills vary between characters. depending on the skill, it may be always activated at the start of the duel (e.g. starting with yami on the field), optionally activated when a player meets certain conditions (e.g. ensuring the next drawn card is a spell or trap card after the player's life points have dropped by 1800), or always activated when a condition is met (e.g. inflicting damage when the player activates a trap card).extra monster zones are not used, with extra deck monsters functioning as they did before the introduction of the extra monster zone.my consensusi've been playing since the official us release. with any mobile free-to-play game, there are microtransactions. each month, they release card boxes that can be bought using gems, the in-game currency. gems are earned by simply playing the game and completing challenges. they're also given away like candy at times by konami. packs can also be outright bought with actual money. card boxes usually contain 200 or 80 packs, depending if they're a full or mini box. each pack you purchase contains 3 cards, so you'll likely be grinding for that certain card for quite awhile. legendary duelists also have certain card drops that you'll be grinding for as well. the game itself is honestly a giant time sink and very p2w, but the current meta deck, cyber angels, is completely f2p. all-in-all, it's a fun, but sometimes frustrating game. pvp can be cancerous at times, depending on the meta, but it's the best yu-gi-oh game at the moment, in my opinion. if you're a fan of card games and yu-gi-oh, i recommend giving it a try.to returning duel links playersoverall, the port seems pretty good.auto duel is extremely fast. i have yet to run into any bugs. i'll update if i do. you also receive an alt-art bewd upon logging in.if you'd like to run the game at fullscreen, follow these instructions:go to your steam install folder.open steamapps/commonfind the folder yugioh duel linksopen the folder and run duellinksconfiguration.exefrom there, you can change the resolution and enable/disable fullscreen mode.",1

11056,"one of the bes things about this game is the free stuff you get. your first win of the day gives you a booster pack. the short campaign gives you 5 starter decks, and you get some more free decks every week. the game is very generous in giving boosters. for example, instead of buying boosters for 1000 gold, you can pay 2500 gold to play the game mode called the forge where you draft 25 cards and can win up to 4 additional boosters.it plays similar to like magic the gathering while only visually looks like hearthstone. you can get all the cards without paying any money, but it will be a huge grind anyway. eternal is more mechanic-friendly compared to hex, but both are fun and different games. if anything, i'd say eternal is more casual. eternal still has a lot of advanced mechanics that you can find in mtg though. the main advantage eternal has over hex that attracted me to this game was that this game is available on mobile platforms.",1

5827,"a truly evolving combat flight simulation. the platform started as lock on: modern air combat in 2003. since then, the developer decided to part ways with ubisoft and successfully made a niche for themselves. dcs world is the world of tanks for modern flight simulation. its still in its infancy with the scope. things are constantly being updated/added and it has become a premier flight simulation. the graphics engine is dated with more cpu intensive processes, but the engine is due for a change with a revolutionary new edge (eagle dynamics graphic engine) that should be released this year. the planes are represented in painstaking detail. the physics for each plane is the most accurate representation in any flight simulation, including military trainers.the base game is free and allows you to fly the su-25t and tf-51d. but the others can be purchased through addons. there are two lines of dcs addons:dcs: xxx :: fully detailed aircraft including clickable cockpits. you need to spend 3-5 min just starting up the aircraft. just like pilots in real life.dcs: xxx flaming cliffs :: a study simulation. there are easy one button presses to get the systems/avionics going, but the aircraft physics is still modelled very much like the dcs counterparts.at the end of the day, this is one of those must play simulations if you like flying aircraft. they still have a way to go with limited campaigns, dated graphics etc.. but things are improving with every version.gameplay: 8/10graphics: 7/10audio: 7/10replayability: 9/10must play. endless hours of entertainment.",1

4677,"i have played 3 moba games so far and i wasn't really into trying another one but recently i wanted to give it a shot since i heard about it a lot and got released on steam. i now play mainly hots and i love it but i will play smite as an off-moba sometimes cause it has some features that don't require me to invest time to learn from the beggining a new moba and set it part a bit from the classic strategy focused lol and dota. so if you too are heavily invested in a main moba, here are the reasons why you should play smite to blow off some steam every now and then. 1) it has 2 game modes that require no jungling or warding and it is just mindless massacre: arena and assault, mainly arena is the pure massacre with no real towers, just plainly kill each other. 2)it has the option to auto lvl up and auto purchase items, so if you can't bother like me to learn about new items and skills or whatever this contributes tremendously in just going in and kill gods, eventually though you will start wanting to purchase your own items since you will play enough to have the urge to change your build a bit. 3) it gives away for free some starting gods that are relatively easy and fun to play so no need to farm asap for your first god. generally it is a unique gameplay wise moba and the action based camera and combat have an amusing feeling. at first it will be hard to get used to the gameplay specially if you come from another moba game but eventually you get used to it and it is quite fun. if you are a starter on moba genre, i wouldn't suggest smite as your first moba as it is not a pure representative of genre nor as easy as the other isometric camera view moba games. it retains the fed concept from lol and dota but not in a terrible scale but the 50% of your hp-one ability concept exists. also the concept of fighting gods is really great and if you love mythology you grow a special feeling when you play your favorite mythological god no matter what his/her abilities are. smite's referal program is quite rewarding and by simply logging in every day in 4 weeks you get a free skin with the amount of gems they give. in-game currency progression is faster than lol's and hots's but not by far and the graphics are quite decent although they could use some improvement in some models, the environments are pretty great though. final verdict: try it if you have played another moba, come back if you are rookie after you have played another moba.",1

11159,"3 card sets and 2 expansions already released, and eternal is still plagued by the same inconsistencies as it was months ago. and it's a shame because the game could be really good if it wasn't for an unacceptable amount of non-games. more and more cards have been released with the intent to help with that issue, meanwhile we're still dealing with oversized decks, both in constructed and draft, without a proper mulligan to at least try and counter the variance brought by having that many cards in a deck. i really want to like eternal and i can't wait for the day this review will finally change to positive, but right now i just can't. edit: client update recently rolled out, some ui and stability improvements, set 4 coming up, everything looks nice... ... aaand the game still plays like a slot machine. at this point it's just getting old, i'm not even sure why i still try to believe they'll ever manage to make it consistent enough to be fun.",0

10977,"i paid about 100 usd and climbed to gold rank in two weeks, with the win rate of 70% or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.pros:it is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. the cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving +1 +1 to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.cons:the playing itself is very dull and rng heavy and frustrating.if you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.if both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. if the opponent plays tavrod for 2 turns and you only have 1 removal, you lose.if the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn 3, you lose.if the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.if your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a steward of the past, which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.at the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. in hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. in eternal you never know if you should keep the lightning storm.matches are very snow-bally, one sided and rng. i feel whatever i do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome. you can try and play for free.but be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.i will come back only if they change the power system.",0

7491,"when this game first came out, it was amazing so much do it in the game.but that's when the game first came out. whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours. i'll go into more detail on the cons near the end.pros:-great fun with friends if you're all new to the game!-the massive range of items in the game-how they submit workshop creations into the game-they keep updating this game and adding more content e.g. new classes!-this game is free 2 playcons:-the grinding in this game is stupidly long.-in-game purchases-quickly gets boring if you're a casual playerokay, the reason why i'm not going to be going into the pros into more detail as they're self explained from my view. but i'll be going over the cons as quite a large range of people who've played this game have encountered this problem as i have.first con: the grinding. if you're a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is. this con is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end. okay, once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first 4 hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid.second con: with the in-game purchases this is completely optional, but what the in-game purchases give you are quite stupid. but the in-game purchases you don't have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see alot of reviews saying pay 2 play. in my opinion i don't see the game as pay 2 play as i haven't spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from.third con: if you're a casual player like me, you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take alot of your time e.g. the grinding in this game. i'm not saying it's a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added (which i think a few have encountered) i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game.my final opinion.i recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isn't a bad thing. what i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it'll help the game progression for players which don't have the sort of time like others.thank you for reading my review.",1

11322,"i put about 25 hours into this game, but now i'm quitting, and i don't recommend you waste your time. eternal creators don't understand how to balance cards, and legendaries dominate the game. they are also incedibly, incredibly rare. after about 25 hours, i have legendaries for 5% of the original, and 5% of the expansion. and now? oh now, they decide to update the game to give less prizes. so now instead of winning a silver crate every 3rd ranked win which only nets you a rare anyways, now you get 2 reds, which each one gives you a common. this game is grind city and now they are getting greedier.many of their card creation is just idiotic as well. for instance, there is a cockroach that gives every other cockroach in your hand and deck +1/+1 every time you play it. so there's an entire deck dedicated to just playing a hundred cockroaches over and over and over through copying and bringing it back. sounds exciting, doesn't it? hey, it's a cockroach! and another! and another! and another! and another! hey, a cockroach for the 5th and 6th turns in a row! this is a fun game with exciting interactions!!! (/s) and that's when you aren't running into decks that are made of nothing but legendaries, which have no limitations on them. the eternal creators seem to want to take all the fun out of actually playing the cards, and they don't understand how to design a card game whatsoever. it's a shame, because it was fun for a little while until the flaws became glaringly obvious and prizes were reduced.oh, and there are plenty of bugs, too. for instance, there's a weapon that gives +*/+* where *=number of justice power you have banked up. it's a weapon that does not give this ability to a creature. but for some reason, when your creature gets silenced, it also silences your weapon (which it's not supposed to do). think they would fix it in their 3 latest bug fixes? nope!",0

3031,"a lot of people hate the game because gaijin changed things for the worse. arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. however, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more unenjoyable, i beg to differ all of these negative reviews.firstly let's start off with my experience. i have at least 400 hours logged from the game before i joined steam. i've played for about a year now, before steam, so i know what i'm talking about.okay. so about the game itself - it's a wwii simulation. arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (and as of june, tanks) to however you want to have them. there is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - you can add decals, paint the vehicle (after getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc.playing with friends is very easy. just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.another thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. ghost shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (look on my video section for a war thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown). there is little music in the game, if any. it is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/mp3/ipod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. the other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying (the enemy has taken the base! we must get it back at all costs! - nosherlock).overall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not superhardcorepvpmustwin. just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like i do. give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it.",1

'there's ants here, honey. i wanna get out of here.' so they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the  they're eating. they get up and walk toward the door to go to red because they think, 'that spot near the a point for red is pretty good.' they walk out the door, and they see four level 3 sentry guns pointing at them. they get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.the blu scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people afk when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. he walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'i'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch gaben, i'm going to praise gaben!' and he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a spy that has been sitting with the cloak and dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds...110/10",1
9798,"wost mmo i've played in a long time. freemium and pay-to-win at its finest. most free mmos have paid cash items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in pvp or not i don't care its still bull. this game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will literally teleport behind you breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests don't work properly, the options don't work properly. now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for some games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2d and 3d moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to pay for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you pay for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or pay to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the ui is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left ctl for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute i got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. i love mmorpgs but this is the worst i have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will never play again. only reason why i played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others mmos with each other for a week. in short: god this was utter trash and a nightmare to play i never want to play again nor probably never will.*i was playing add which is supposidly a mage class apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther mmos because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game doesn't show your max hp so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much hp you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 seconds even if you have 3 different potions on your quick slots they all go on cooldown, if the potions regened health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.",0

6736,"to make this game different to the pool of wanna-be cod and bf's or make lots of money of the back of dissapointed gamers dont know it could be either, they decided to make you have to have different soldiers with really restricted playstyles and worse you have to pay for your gear, not like just buy a gun pay for your ammunition and grenades and weapon repair, which makes the grind even slower. you could help your teamates win the round by taking out those 4 enemies with your grenade but you dont because the grenades cost a forturne. want to get your soldier to have long range weapons on the fly, pay over 100,000 silver for it. or do you want give one of your lower tier soldiers one of your high tier guys weapons to help him level up, yeah thats not happening the other guy needs to buy it himself... think the matchmaking is good, just lumber everyone in together in a game where equipment differences are massive. as an fps game on its own the actual gameplay is nothing to be amazed about its between poor-okay nothing great. and the command thing is different but overall a high level exclusive irrelivent peice of crap. if you ever complain about bf5 or codww2 on some ground or another because the developers did something you dont agree or whatever you want to say, be thankfull you dont have to pay for all of your soldiers upkeep and worry about the cost of that greande you could throw. if you dont belive me play the game, but trust me its a waste of space, its not worth a single megabite of your computer.",0

13159,"i started playing this because i was under the mistaken assumption it provided unlocks in fallout 4. it does not, if you have the same misconception.so, why the negative review? and the answer is that the game uses tedium and enforced grinding as a gameplay mechanic, and it doesn't have to.the game concept itself is novel enough, and if you like the fallout universe, it's pretty cute. it's simple, but it was meant for mobile devices, so that makes sense. build a vault, manage your settlers, fight baddies for loot, rinse, wash and repeat. all of that is just well and dandy.the problem arises from the fact that there's basically no ai, and everything is agonizingly manual. resources got produced? gather those suckers manually. loot got found? gather that stuff manually. danger at the vault? manually tell people to go help. and then go to the next room when the danger spreads, rather than remember why they were sent. ready to give birth? not until the overseer delivers your kid themself. it goes on and on.it's micromanagement without depth, which means that it's just a chore, at the end of the day. well, that and waiting. the combat system is 95% waiting, and not whilst the app/game is closed; sit there, and watch healthbars slowly fall, hoping you'll get a crit and somethingf to do.and then they hit you with the paid content to make things quicker, easier, and more automated. you literally pay to play less, and be bothered less. nothing against paid content, they have a right to make money from their work. but paid content should give you more of the game, not less of the annoyance. top tier weapons? just less waiting in combat. you can bypass the whole process by not playing it at all.",0

6171,"tl;dr is at the bottom (i don't blame you for not wanting to read this for how long it is)this game is very unbalanced, you can have nothing but the starter gun, the starter gun being a semi-automatic rifle while other people are driving around in tanks. to get a tank you have to get to rank 5, to level up it takes about 20 hours, and not to mention the fact that you have to fork over 40,000 credits to switch to the armored divison and get a tank with no actual cannon, just an lmg and the thinnest armor imaginable. when someone is in a tank and you don't have a rocket launcher there is literally nothing you can do about it unless they poke their head out the top to look around, and that's hoping that you don't get sniped first (snipers are very overpowered because they one shot you no matter where you get hit and take forever to get unless you pay or have 100,000 credits and get the required medals. and after that you have to use it without a scope until you unlock it, and it's the last thing you unlock and costs an arm and a leg to buy.) and not to mention the slow progression in this game that becomes very frustrating becuase of one-hit snipers, tanks and having to repair guns and vehicles with credits, if they reach 0% you can't use them. the only time the game is somewhat fun, is when there arn't many tanks and snipers or if you a tank or a sniper or if you have a good tank or sniper. but the devs have added one mode that doesn't allow tanks, and for it there is one map with one objective in one building, but that might be worse because to go in it means that you walk into a cluster of grenades. let me also talk about the fact that this game is not skill based at all, if you have the starter gun you will get destroyed by everyone (by everyone i mean the people that have paid because everyone else has gotton bored and given up) and everyone that has paid has an automatic weapon, if you have the starter gun and you're going up against someone with an auto you will get destroyed simply by fire rate because every gun in the game has the same damage, and becase that person has an auto they fire 30x faster than you, killing you almost instantly. this game is not worth downloading, it's not even worth the store page that it has imotldr:tanks and snipers are very overpowered and take forever to get, making progression frustrating. automatic weapons are also op becuase every gun in the game does the same amount of damage meaing that an ar does the same damage as your rifle, but the ar shoots 30x faster. it also takes about 50-100 hours to get because it's almost the last thing you unlock. 3/10 terrible5/10 if you have good tank, sniper or ar",0

2144,"what to say about path of exile? is it just another silly action rpg with mindless grinding on the market? well, the game has a lot to offer and i'm not, by any means, the best person to tell you everything about it, but, i can tell for sure, that i've experience enough to assure you that this is an amazing action rpg, with an immense variety of builds, items and gameplay styles, besides the complex item economy. the fact that you've no restrictions (in terms of classes / characters) to use items and skills, as well as skill tree paths, creates an enormous variety of builds, making every character an unique experience. the game has beautiful graphics, with an exceptional dark theme to it; blood and corpses are everywhere, and that really gives that gruesome ambientation and, on top of that, the soundtrack, background sounds and noises really adds to this macabre experience. most people say that this is the true successor of diablo 2, although i can't tell for sure if it's true or not, this game is, certainly, way better than the sequel that is diablo 3 (even with the dlc reaper of souls), don't get me wrong, both games are great, but path of exile has way more to offer and innovation is what the game industry is looking for. how is call of duty even alive?the game is going through constant updates and there is content everywhere, always something new to explore, be it items, areas, story, skills, etc.. the development team is constantly active and shows a lot of interest in what the community has to say about the game, which is a huge plus.tl;drastonishing gameplay, pretty graphics, amazing developers, complex economy and a huge variety in terms of builds. a game that i can't recommend enough for those who are seeking a new action rpg, give this game a try and you might be surprised -- don't be scared about the skill tree though.",1

8334,"in this review i'm mainly going to focus on the free2play/pay2win aspect of the game.i'm writing this as reaction to all the misinformation and outright bull*** spread around by clueless inviduals who gave up on the game the second someone with better gear made them feel inferior to the core, resulting in them calling neverwinter pay2win ever since.let me state it right off the bat. there's nothing, and i mean nothing in this game that can't be obtained by just playing - and it doesn't even take crazy long to get your character into elite gear either.but you're not limited to just weapons and armor - all cosmetics, mounts, pets, literally everything is at your disposal without spending a penny.the game features a currency exchange system between astral diamonds (the game's primary currency, among others also used by auction house, where you can get pretty much everything) and zen (premium currency used in zen store, aka cash shop).there's no limit to how much you can exchange and you can do it both ways, so once you start running epic dungeons or find any other way to earn ad, you can get yourself whatever your heart desires, leaving your wallet untouched.so it's all up to you. sure, you can spend cash to speed up your progress in getting things if you want, but it's most definitely not a necessitty. i've never spent a cent myself, yet all my characters are in the ultimate gear, riding the fastest mounts, and it's not a rare sight that i get called a casher by people who don't know their way around the game yet and blindly believe you can't get the best stuff without paying. those are the same people who eventually ditch the game and end up writing zomg p2w reviews over here in their bliss ignorance.tl;dr: if you don't mind spending some (reasonable) time working towards your gear, improving it piece by piece, you won't have any problems getting your characters anything you might like, without spending cash. i believe that's one of the things that rpg's are about after all, making your character more powerful as you progress through the game.if you just want to have the best stuff handed to you for free without spending time (or money), well then look for a different game. and good luck with that too.with this out of the way, it's time for some pros and cons.pros-as mentioned, a solid free2play model that doesn't require you to spend money at all-six classes, each of which can be built and played in a number of ways, offering a completely different experience-i want to say enjoyable and entertaining gameplay and combat system, but that's highly subjective, so you best see for yourself.-a lot of lore if that's your thing-very good visuals-there are new short-term events coming up every few weks, usually in the form or a time-limited skirmish event (for instance call to arms: defend the temple is active right now), or a chance of valuable event items dropping form any mobs you kill for a couple of days-there are also neat seasonal events that last about a month, like summer festival and winter festival, with a lot of stuff to do for fun or decent rewards-new content being constantly added, altho the rate of large content updates (so called modules) is a tad low.-a large scale of gear and transmutation items that, along with dyes and dye packs, let you give your character a unique lookcons-endgame content is still slightly lacking, especially in the pvp department. however, it's being worked on, there's been a rather large pvp update two weeks back and even more stuff is on the way in the incoming module 3.-ever since the shards merged, the game tends to be a bit laggy from time to time. just for the record, the server is located in the us and live in europe.a few notes:-noticed some people complaining about bots. i haven't seen a single bot in lvl 60 pvp in months. the only bots i ever see are the ones spamming zone chat with website links, and those you get used to easily. i basically don't even perceive them anymore.-i have minimal experience with dnd, so i can't comment on the game in that regard.",1

(although i personally prefer shiny guns). the overall gameplay is fast paced in most places, but can be given a much different manner based on the class you play. even the weapon choices define the way you will play. this game is 100% free, and there's no real pay-to-win aspect to it. only pay-to-look-really-good. there's basically no reason not to buy this game. get it. now.thanks, and have fun.",1

14949,"i genuinely used to love this game when it was first brought out. it was fun, innovative and hilarious to see some of the creations players came up with. it was a good mix of builder as well as fps. i don't know what they were thinking when they made the more recent changes but the game has definitely lost a lot of what made it fun.one of the aspects they removed which i particularly liked was the way their premium worked. it used to be that anyone in your battle who had premium would increase everyone's reward by 5%; this was very, very sadly removed. this made buying premium feel like it was worth it as everyone benefited from it, but now premium users only receive more junk in their crates, which is more often than not just as useless.the new loot crate system they have in place feels a lot like its starving players. as an established player i can't imagine how anyone new to this game will be able to make anything capable of standing up to other established players. barely anything of use is rewarded meaning you have to spend a lot more time in game to be able to even earn simple upgrades for your bot. salvaging is a painful waste as well as you receive so little currency in return for anything you might not need, and even then you're scrimping through your supplies to find something you can spare to salvage. everything is stupidly expensive from this perspective as you make so little from salvaging that even purchasing building blocks is painful. you really do need to rely on whatever rewards you earn making it difficult and very time consuming. you can purchase the best crates from the store but this is a money drain as they too aren't guaranteed to give you anything of use.the weapons feel highly unbalanced as anything with high power has a very high cost of energy, often leaving you defenceless. there isn't a tech tree anymore either, so (in my opinion) levelling feels very tedious. i have no desire to level as it feels like i'm not being rewarded and often just feels like work. you don't often earn much in the way of experience from the battle modes, making the most effective means of levelling the solo player mode which strips it of its multiplayer aspect. you can earn a bit more experience from the arena modes, however, due to the weapons, these too feel very unbalanced. more often than not you are up against established players with much better weapons and the more elite items available, e.g. the power shields, so beginner players often don't stand a chance.the megabots were one of the best parts of the game and they too were removed. they offered a direction for battle which was good aspect as it felt like there was a leader. having someone to follow and support more often helped the game's direction. their components however remain in game but at stupidly high costs for both in game currency and pflop requirements which makes them almost pointless, as you often can't afford to equip them even if you could afford to purchase them. so established players also hold this over beginning players as they have these mega weapons and beginning players are less likely to ever get them.from the outside it seems a lot like the developers are trying to cater to the more negative comments from players and the robocraft community. it's been stripped, twisted and turned into something that feels almost like an entirely different game to how it was. it's a shame to see what it's become, as it really did start off going from strength to strength only to hit this very disappointing low.summary- paid premium is almost useless and only gives premium users an extra chance at useless junk in their loot crates.- loot crates offer very little of anything useful and purchasing premium crates doesn't guarantee useful equipment which is starving new players. it's near impossible to build or upgrade bots unless you put in very large amounts of time.- salvaging for currency is a joke; salvaging only returns a very minimal amount of currency making it nearly impossible to purchase items. this along with the very random, often useless returns from the loot crate means nothing you receive is worth salvaging, and if it is, is too badly needed to afford being salvaged.- megabots were removed, but their components are still in game but aren't cost or pflop efficient. this took out a big, fun part of the feel of robocraft.",0

26,"an interesting and quirky experience for me. almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. difficulty-wise, it's not hard; almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. however, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. it all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. in regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. the humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). the horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and i didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so i believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. in my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.all in all, if you're a fan of horror games, i'd say give this at least a try. it's different and has a charm to it that i believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique.",1

25889,story time:this absolutely crushed me. i was in middleschool but had a lead in the highschool musical (winthrop in the music man). i often called a local radio station for requests when doing homework or whatever. the guy knew my voice and was very friendly. once rehearsal ran really late and i called in at like 11 30. the dude basically wondered what a little girl was doing up so late and i had to tell him i was a boy and then hung up. never called again. he is still on the radio i kinda want to see if he remember that.,1
2653,"indeed, even though i've got almost a 1000 hours logged (not even including the many hours playing this outside steam before it officially launched), i can't recommend war thunder. reason: the grind. it's horrible. it takes hundreds of hours to unlock higher tier tanks and planes, forcing you to grind or pull your wallet. the graphics are great, the gameplay is great (except for terrible balance issues) and it will hook you, but it would be better to avoid being hooked. a terrible waste of time. if the grind in the higher tiers was comparable to tiers 1/2 it would be a great game. but of course, that would mean many players will reach endgame, unlocking everything there is to unlock and potentially losing interest. great for players, bad for gaijin as every customer is a potential virtual opium addict, milkable of cash.it takes 1000s of dollars to unlock everything. a premium account only helps on lower tiers, you still have to grind xx-xxx hours on the highest tiers and that's the problem. freemium isn't free. i'm all for forcing 'free to play users' to grind, but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that's clearly not the case. spending 60 usd on a premium account + 1 vehicle unclock is but the tip of the tip of the iceberg. so even if you pay, it won't make a difference on higher tiers. the reaility is that it takes months, or weeks at 40+ hours a week using a premium account. that's just ridicilous. got millions of convertable xp? use it to progress faster! but pay 50 usd on top of that to be allowed to actually use it.there simply shouldn't be such a grind for paying users. spending around 60 usd should give you a lot more bang for bucks. paying 100 usd for a tank takes the fun away. gaijin can do whatever they want, it's free, but the implementation is offensive to loyal, paying users. i'd happily spent my money on premium, but the difference is so small that i don't do so anymore.every game, even those that hold a pricetag, should have a certain amount of grinding. the difference between free and premium progression is just too small to justify the price it takes to progress.",0

1761,"with over 110 heroes to choose from, dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on steam. many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game. while this is probably dota 2's greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is. there is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime.verdict: dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding. yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an average player may take well over 100 hours. however, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, dota 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.",1

1101,"fractured space is an immense and at most times intense space ship shooter. as it is a team based control point style game you require team effort and support from other players on your side, tactics are an important part of the game and the worst thing you can do is follow your team into the enemy base and get yourself killed!i'm going to do a serious review on this because i actually like this game!what is fractured space?fractured space is a team-based space combat game with a lot like the control points gamemode from tf2, the ships themselves in the game are based around capital ships for example, frigates, cruisers, battleships and the things you see a lot in sci-fi games. the ships feel large and weighty in space (even though there is no gravity) and they are slow to control, just like a large capital ship would feel like (if you catch my drift!) the aim of the game is to work as a team based fleet and capture control points a1/a2 or b1/b2 to make your way to the enemy base, though beware! the enemy will try to do the same, the combat in the game makes it epic and this game, though in early access is very promising and is definitely going in the right direction!with 3 starting ships, you fight to earn xp and different corporation style currencies to upgrade your ship or buy your own! (more on the 3 types of ship later)proscombat systemthe combat system in this game fits well with the style of the game.the capital ships in the game feel, fly and fight like capital ships!there are many different capital ships in the game with different classes, corvette, assault, flagship, support, etc.the different ships have they're own classes! corvette for support, flagship for defence/mid-assault and frigate for frontline assault.the combat is competitive.each ship has custom abilities from launching missiles and disabling beams to hanger based defenses for launching fighters and drones.different skins for different ships.different crew members which add extra things to some stats.consit does have some pay to win features, which i dislike, a lot. (not the actual p2w features but the fact it has p2w anyway) so the pay to win isn't really much in this game, it mainly includes extra skins for your ships and extra crew.there is an in-game upgrade system, i don't know anything about it/how to use it other than it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer essentially means that it gives your team/enemy teams better buffs for some ships, making the games quite unfair.requires agreement to a 3rd-party eula now this... this is something i do not like in a game, i hate it honestly, i understand it allows a set up for an account, but if the register sites servers are down then you cannot register and cannot play, also it takes time out of your excitement when you want to play this game, so you better have an email address ready!this might just be me but being in europe, and playing in europe servers i still get quite high ping, so did my friends and some of their friends when we last played some games of it.can be grindy at times but that's only if you want upgrades/currency, and to get that you have to get kills so if your bad at this game your kinda screwed!so should i buy this game?well that depends! if you like the sound of playing a space shooter based upon larger ships instead of fighters then go for it! but if you don't fancy it then don't bother! personally, i think you should buy this game, perhaps 6.99 is a bit steep for some people but for me it seems perfectly reasonable.final verdict:buy this game!",1

2019,"an excellent action rpg for all diablo 2 fans out there. for me diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. in path of exile i actually expect to find useful items. i constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.another thing i disliked about diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. maybe i'm weird but i enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of procurement, you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.poe has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. you could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but i disagree. you can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. the skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.the skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and i find it nicely flexible to fit whatever i want out of a build at the time. it's more than just unlocking a fireball; you can divide that fireball to several fireballs each dealing a bit less damage but that way gaining more aoe, you can then add other types of damage to it or even make it a damage-over-time focused fireball instead of explosions, if you so wish.in conclusion i wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good arpg experience. it starts out a bit slow but trust me, it's worth it and once you get into it, you won't be able to stop theorycrafting new builds to try.",1

2004,"so currently i only have around 24 hours and i am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.path of exile is fantastic. every steam owner should at one point or another try this game. however, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around 7 hours to get there (for me at least). this game is basically the paladins to diablo. personally i think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.art stylein act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. i personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act 3 being the nicest looking act thusfar. diablo i think should be a keymark for this. just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. poe is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. progressionok this is purely opinion based but i will try to be as objective as possible. diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. in this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. in poe it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. that being skills are merely items that you equip. this system allows for much more creativity but can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. in my personal opinion i think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. howeverpoe wins in the costumazation department purely because of the passive skill tree. holy crap. this skill tree. no barriers locked behind class walls. all classes can have any passive. that is so. refreshing. rarely ever do i see games do this and i still have no idea why. gameplaythis is an action rpg. meaning prepare yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. overall this is a must play. i intend to progress farther and play for engame content.",1

2860,if you're looking for a balanced game this is not the game for you. match making balance is the worst aspect of this game and you would think it would be otherwise. if you like playing against different era vehicles which outclass you in every way possible then this is the game for you. it gets pretty t real ing fast when you're in ww2 era fighting the coldwar era.it gets real grindy as well to research new vehicles.most of the time you're on theend of the stick but every now and then you hold the stick and even then if you're team is incompetent don't expect much from others.it's a love/hate relationship with this game.,0

8984,"ps2 is a great game, and i highly recommend it, if you've got a strong enough pc to play it smoothly. been playing on and off for the past couple of years, not on steam (i had 389 hours in on the miller european server before i switched to the u.s. west coast server, for a grand total of 418 as of this writing).a big thing for me is that the player base tends to be considerably more decent than that of a lot of other competitive shooter-type mmos i've played. and dbg seems to be really on top of hackers and cheaters lately. they tend to announce in-game when they've booted a cheater; i recently saw a broadcast message to all players a few sessions ago that ding dang dong has been bing bang banned for cheating. i guess the guy's name was that, or something like that, and the admin online was feeling frisky. got a kick out of that. anyway.but, of course, the real kick of the game is the massive battles involving 100-150 players, with bombers and fighters sparring overhead as the tanks and sundies (troop transports/mobile spawn points) roll across the battlefield amid the blips of players on foot. it really accomplishes something there, and the feel is great.as with any free-to-play game, progression is painfully slow if you don't spend *some* money on the game to get a few important goodies, like a heavy pistol, anti-aircraft guns for your max and light tank, and some heavier weaponry for your heavy tank, but the beginning weapons are noted as being competitive. in all honesty, i really don't know if i'd continue to enjoy the game nearly as much if i'd never spent a cent on it (and i've been pretty cheap -- we're on a tight budget, so i've spent $30 total on it), but i suppose it's a matter of patience.i can say, though, that if you can, the game is worth the money you'll spend on it.unless you're on a core 2 duo or something. in that case, just... no. you're going to be very frustrated with this. i am not sure -- i think they have optimized it better, but it is still very heavy-feeling, at least on our 4gb core 2 duo clunker.those caveats aside, it's a great game, and i highly recommend it.",1

10313,"when i started this game, i didn't know what to expect. i started running into the grassy field in front of me, and found nothing, even after 20 minutes. i questioned this walking simulator, however crouched down, and started walking much slower. a few minutes later, i heard a deer call, and being a novice, simply walked toward it ( i didn't know yet that you are equipped with a tracker that locates where the deer was) i pulled out my rifle and scoped in to the general vicinity that i believed the deer to be. shortly, i saw it in my sights. i took careful aim, fired, and completely missed. the deer ran away, and i didn't get a kill that hunt.all in all, i absolutely adore this game. the gorgeous wild beauty mixed with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal makes this game incredibly fun-for me at least. see, this game isn't a game where you get kills every other minute, this is a game in which up to hours of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sights. if you blow the shot, you can expect a minimum of 20-30 minutes either tracking the same animal down, or looking for a different beast all together. another thing about this game that puts people off is the price tag. although the game itself is f2p, you have to buy hunting licenses for all animals expect the whitetail deer. furthermore, the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor (to conceal your scent from the deer's) or a tent (to start your hunt at a place which you placed your tent in previous hunts) alongside rifles, shotguns, and handguns;is to pay occasionally large sums of real money. for some, this is the ultimate turn off. i believe it to be irritating that you have to pay for this content, however i am still content with the game itself.(see what i did there?) 9/10 for a solid, realistic, and accurate hunting game with a few flaws.",1

2474,"welcome to war thunder, the game where b-17s can get shoot down by a russian biplane, let's get started.things i like:- realistic flying mechanic- damage modules-both planes and tanksand that's it.now, let's get to the things i hate.- balance -> this game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: usa, uk, germany, japan and russia, now, the real problem (seen from a usa main) is that every nation exept for usa and maybe uk is overpowered, especially russia.it might be me, but i think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 us bomber.- teammates -> altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will steal your kills and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds )))- bombers -> as a us bombers main, i realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially b-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the b-17 is probably one of the weakest. and it's kinda strange, since in real life, the b-17 was one of the best bombers.- russia -> every russian plane\tank is overpowered, i litterally got bored of playing as us and constatly get shot down by russia that i tried to play russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.-every tank that's not russian seems to have armor made of cardboard, you can literally shoot at least 10 times at a russian tank and you won't do anything to it, then you get destroyed by like 5 machine gun rounds from a russian tank.the usual joke about this game is that it is russian biased, well guess what? it ing is!people ofter ask is this game pay to win? of course it isn't, it's play russia to win.so, if you don't like to loose, grab your sekrit dokumints, put on your tracksuit and your ushanka, choose your russian plane made of stalinium and spam &quot everywhere you can and put on kalinka or the russian march of red alert 2, oh, don't forget to write xaxaxaxaxaxa ))) after every kill. now that you know how to play russia in wt, you're ready to go tovarish.",0

14846,"the game used to be good. trust me, you don't want to play. i've been keeping up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relating to it, only because i'm too lazy to unfollow them on facebook. the patches seem to be following the pattern i saw in the days leading up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago. i've noticed their desperate attempts to add band-aid features and balances that are meant to appease their fans and keep them around and have them pay 2 win. the dlcs aren't worth their cost at all, $35 dollars for a flyer that won't last 5 seconds in a match? lmao!! and $50 for premium? wtf?!?!? at most its worth $10! at most!i've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. and then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of hell itself. how? idk. supposedly, at some point, freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. the crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. premium was never worth the price. in the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. as a newbie back then, i can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me 6 months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. after a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. and of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than 3 colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. and after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. but thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get 1 of that item, let alone the 3 or 4 you'd need for it to be viable. and by that time, the devs would have initiated at least 4000 different metas. in the early days, everything was relatively balanced. of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. after a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). so, they did some quick patches to fix that. r.i.p. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. while that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. there were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). so, slap some tier 2 armor on, then slap some tier 7 guns on, go rek the tier 4 people, ggez. but tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. then came the flak cannons, rip flyers of all kinds. then came rockets, rip everything. then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (i forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. then came the shotguns. then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. after that i left, no surprise really. i'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since i left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than i think (which is saying something, cause i think its a ton). there's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. you want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? even the most popular robocraft youtuber, rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. really the only remaining popular robocraft youtubers are gromek999 and jac733. i can only assume that they are paid by freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, i don't know how anyone could make a positive video on robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. they could pay me $10mil a video and i still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a game. in conclusion, don't waste a single second on this game. but even more importantly, don't spend a single penny on this game, freejam doesn't deserve your money.",0

3203,"okay i have been playing this game for a little less than a month and i genuinely enjoyed it. its mechanics were really nice, animations were smooth and gmaeplay was really fun. i could also play this on my junk computer at good framerates. it was essentially a really well made free-to-play pubg clone and i loved it. as of late though, not so much. as to what me and a few friends refer to as the fortnite update its not so interesting and just becomes another battle royale game. previously it was more like pubg with getting credits for kills and getting boxes for cosmetics. some friends and i would try to get strategic cosmetics that would help us blend in with the environment and stuff of the sort. with the fortnite update it has introduced 'seasons' and taken away the customizability. i had a decent looking character and tons of cosmetics, but now they are all gone. they instead added what they did with fortnite and with the seasons you unlock different looking characters and cosmetics for gameplay and added a paid adventurer's pass to gain more. i am saddened by this choice from the devs and all the progress i had stripped from me and my friends. this started out as a really nice free to play pubg clone and is turning into a fortnite clone.",0

6745,have folowed development for 2 years (yes the horible browser launcher) and game does not change to any significant degree. sadly this game is not free to play but free to try becouse you will need to pay if you want to do anything else than run around with a gun as standart inf. this is not a bad thing but tanks are not balanced properly as they dominate. yes as inf you can kill it but good luck on open ground with that.so is this game funs as inf. well it can be however gun play is clunky at best (it got worse from last time i played it on browser). there is bad mouse accel wich makes aiming an absolute pain and no way to turn it of. the attacking team is at a big disatvantage becouse the camping side has a good atvantage due to 1 headshot kill mechanics (hard to pull of on moving targets) and how difficult it can be to spot ppl. however getting headshots and kills is verry rewarding and there is real tension due to 1 shot kills. conclusion: the game is verry good in places and at times however it is pay to win becouse everything that isn't standart inf is clearly better to a more or lesser degree. the game has issues balance wise and some smaller ones in other departmends but don't count on any of them being fixed sins there were no noticable changes in my 2 to 3 years of not playing the game. there are better free to play shooters and this game is only free to play in the most strict meaning of the word.,0

14017,"this is a game that over reaches on just about every aspect and then falls flat on its face.recently, i was persuaded to install this game and play online with my son. however during the two and a half hour stream, throughout the game, despite the fact that i did enjoy playing with my son, i voiced just how disappointed i was with this game, from the narrative, to the gameplay to the visuals, it looked more like a poor man's dayz, which is saying a lot as that game by itself is very poorly optimized, but is still an awesome game.narrative.what narrative? i have come across some very basic games in the past and each and every single one of them has some form of narrative, even if it is just an explanation of the game. this one has nothing.the game is based on a post apocalyptic world that is now overrun by zombies. that is about as far as the narrative goes. yet as you will read on, the game has a lot of potential, but because of the lack of attention to detail, well... if the narrative is anything to go by, don't expect much else.visuals.the game as a whole has some elements that you can see in other games, most notably, the arma/dayz game. the problem is, you get the distinct impression that the development team just don't give aone of the biggest problems i have with the visuals is the 'draw distance'. some of you may know the specs of my streaming/gaming pc that i use, as i regularly stream other games, at maximum graphical setting so you get the best stream possible to watch. despite the fact my pc is more than capable, this game is just terribly optimised. the draw distance in this game is ridiculous. you get the high quality textures for about 10 feet in front of your character, then you get the low quality textures after that, and combined with the poor texture optimisation, that same 10 feet is where you get all the game assets in visual range, anything beyond this, some of the assets simply disappear. this problem can be seen on any map, in any server at any time.another issue is the poor quality of the 'better quality textures' and the models used in the game. the buildings for the most part can not be entered, which is unusual for a game that is based on survival, instead we get a box with a texture. for the buildings you can enter, they are very empty, with no furniture, chairs, kitchens... not even rubbish. just the odd pick up every now and then.the models and animations used for the zombies and even your character are very sub par. the zombies animations look more comical than scary as they tend to bounce towards you with both hands in the air. your character models are also something not to be admired. in first person mode, the hands some times do not match up with the weapon you are holding. certain wearable items you can collect are laughable, as depending on what character you have selected/created there hair, jacket will show through the item you picked up.another part thatme off was the maps themselves as there is very little attention to detail put into the maps. the more prominent problem is the amount of assets that are left suspended in mid air. grass, rocks, some trees, vehicles, and i even seen a building or two that were above the ground.you get the distinct impression that the developers took no pride in creating the game as a whole and rushed it. overall, it looks like it was created with an old unity game engine using stock assets. with such obvious laziness in the visual side of the game, it is hard to find anything good to say about it.if it was designed using an older game engine, there is no excuse for the ingvisuals. you have to take into consideration that this game is less than 2 years old, and looks as though some dude in his mom's basement made this game in his spare time. but i suspect there is more to this, and that is revealed in the gameplay.gameplay.poor.when you first start the game, there is a basic character creation tool that is very limited in options, and that is for a very good reason. if you want something different, you have to pay... yes the game has micro transactions and is completely littered with them. yes it is a free game to play but if you want to win, you have to pay... so not only is it full of unnecessary micro transactions, it is a pay to win system, which puts it in the same category ofgames along with battlefront ii.when you play the ''survivor'' mode, you select/create your character, and when you join a server, you have to go around and hunt for pickups, from a larger backpack that can hold more items, to armour, weapons, food, drinks, bandages among other useless items that have no bearing on the game. so not bad, but when you take into account that other people have simply paid for a backpack, sniper, armour and other stuff before they even entered the map, it takes the fun out of it instantly as it is no longer an even playing field.what is worse is the fact that when you die, instead of re-spawning back on the same map, you are kicked out of the server and taken back to the lobby. and guess what... your character can not be revived for about 10 minutes, forcing you to create another character, and this is directly linked to the micro transaction side, as those that do spend, when they inevitably get killed, they can not take all them items for that character and transfer them onto the other, so if you do want that awesome sniper, armour or backpack before you jump back into the game, you will have to buy them all over again. are you seeing a pattern yet?when you are in game, it is ing annoying as hell. with the servers being very light on population, and the maps being as big as they are, you can run for an hour and not meet or see anyone. the same can be said about items for you to pick up. and those that have paid for weapons in advance, will simply sit there and snipe you before you even pick up a thing after an hour of roaming around. as i said earlier, pay to win.the size of the maps is of course one problem, but another is the vehicles. yes they can make roaming around faster, but when a troop transporter/tank can get hung up on a chain link fence, or be knocked back by a zombie, it is ultimately a waste of an asset that doesn't work as it should.something that is very laughable is the hit boxes on the zombies themselves. you can shoot next to there head, and it will register as a head shot, yet sometimes, if you shoot them dead in the chest, it wont register a hit at all.and this i don't understand in the slightest. i came across a sort of ''super zombie'' that is double the size of all the other npc's, faster than you and apparently, unkillable. i stood on top of a tank where it could not hit me, and i emptied all my ammo into its head and it would not die. i don't see the point of it, and it takes all what is left of the fun this game had, if any, and pours it down the drain. it stopped the game dead for me, and i was left exposed, unable to move or do anything without being killed and having to start all over again.conclusion.the game looks as though it was rushed, with the worst possible game engine, but crammed full of micro transaction to cash in on the zombie craze that is coming back and the battle royal craze that has hit many other games. it is a game designed for one reason and one reason only... get rich quick.it is a game that is disappointing in every single aspect, and there is not one redeemable point you can take away from the game that makes it seem lessthan what it is.1/10just

4435,"short version: this isn't the real deal, 4000 lp and four card spots? this is dumbed down beyond belief, this is not yu-gi-oh, it's a bad port for a mobile cash-grab that looks like the original card game animated series.more details:1) bad port: you can't play this in full screen. even if you alt+enter (as suggested in their official faq, lol) you'll get the windows bar on the bottom cutting the screen. no way to resize the window, either.2) grindy beyond belief. i know it's f2p, and that it's a card collecting game, you're kinda supposed to buy card packs, but even before you can unlock more advanced features of the game, you have to defeat the same basic ai opponents hours upon hours, after the first hour i just said no, i've got better things to do.3) returning to the not the original yu-gi-oh! point you can see that even in their marketing model: card packs give you 4 cards, as opposed to the standard 7 that you bought back in the day, this flawed digital version of the game is even more expensive than the real life one.there used to be a free project that gave you everything you needed to play the real yugi, digitally ofc, online and offline, and included good ai as well, but apparently they've all been taken down by the konami wits for...whatever this lil'is.negative recommendation because konami takes down good, free projects in order to give us bad, cashgrabs.",0

1462,"update: 1 year and 125 hours of gameplay later and this game has risen to my all time favorites list. matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base. new and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so). visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before. a lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad. it's just heavily focused on grinding. but the devs are active and listening, so i would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months. i would like to also comment on a complaint i've heard a lot: no, this game is not pay-to-win! lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that only change aesthetics. now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved. challenge accepted! now go play fractured space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - original review below:only had the chance to play one round so far but from what i can tell i'm really going to like this game. there is definitely an initial learning curve, since i didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun i've ever had losing! the ship textures are beautiful! the weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome! i'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it). my only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes. i have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, i'd see the network connection tank. would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going. died a couple times because of that. (not a problem with my network btw. it handles all other online games including bf4 flawlessly). i'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that i was just playing on a bad server). all in all, this is a really fun game. the sort of game i've been looking for a long time. it's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars. i'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it. i would definitely recommend it!",1

8203,"this game is sooo addicting... ive played so many mmorpgs but i usually end up quiting cuz of the long, boring and endless hours of grinding. however this game is always action packed with the large amount of bosses/dungeons. you level up quickly from following the main quests so it keeps gamers from getting bored of doing the same thing. dungeons also get super epic when you have a full party of 5 especially when you get later into the game. (level 45+)graphics are amazing at full hd quality, character customization is awesome (get to choose races, jobs etc), combat system is great (similar to tera rising)-- dodge/block system, pvp is fun (kinda like capture the flag or dominion in league of legends), overall game can be competitive (mechanically skilled players can outplay other players with op stuff), and much more.i reached the max level 60, and during that experience it was hella fun! and it gets way better cuz once you hit 60, you get bombarded with more crazy quests and you can customize your character even more with the access to boons (another skill tree). overall i highly recommend this game! it's just amazing bcuz you can have the same amount of fun by yourself or by grabbing some of your buddies to do the dungeons/quests with.10/10",1

9966,"4,000 hours+ later (i was into this game before it went on steam), this game is still terrible. why?1. bad netcodingi usually get 5-15 ping on tf2 servers and i'm commonly accused of ping masking despite the fact that i just have good internet. but in elsword, no matter how good your internet is, you're going to have bullcrap lag problems that can give you major advantages/disadvantages based on your character. i have people in elsword saying that i have the worst internet they've ever seen, but they're generally new players who can't understand that the real problem is that the netcode is sh*t, and my internet is really fast.2. character imbalancesi have a saying in this game that perfectly describes how it is managed.out with the old, in with the newolder classes/characters are generally thought of within a range of high and low. the newer characters are agreeably neither, and are regarded as 'god tier' by the community. why, you ask? kog likes to add enormous advantages to the newer characters for some reason, probably to get money from exp medals and such. the update that really started to screw up the balance many years ago was the s2 update, and it's just been going downhill from there. 3. communitybecause of kog's always-broken balance, the players of the community spend most of their time ranting about how bad everything is rather than playing the game. a lot of players (specifically ws mains) tend to argue about the balance of their characters until no end just to defend their skill. there are a few good players that don't do this, but its generally something pretty dumb people do.4. pvppvp has always been the only reason i ever still play this game. the only problem is how easy it is to get away with trolling/playing really cheaply. players themselves have had to create a meta for how people should play so nobody gets trolled, but it still happens. some people will stop at nothing to get those few extra rank points or another rank, even sacrificing their reputation along the way.5. p2pthere are lots of things that you can only get by being a p2p player (2nd skill slot, amirite?). the game is really pay to play, and people that put their money into getting insane gear levels end up being ridiculously overpowered and can stomp on you pretty much regardless of your skill level. this has existed all throughout elsword's history, but has become a major, major issue when the economy started getting messed up.6. the economyprobably one of the worst parts of the game in general. because of how p2p this game is, getting certain items really matters, but that can be insanely hard with this economy. prices are over-inflated to hell, and some sellers of ice burner sets are only taking cash because of how worthless ed has become. in this game, you'll find that some items are worth over 18 billion ed. starting from the bottom nowdays is very, very hard, and kog refuses to do anything about it.7. the grindit used to be worse, but nobody likes grinding for their levels and gear. i'd much rather just pvp in the freaking game. now the major problem is, korea has different exp tables than na which makes the grind a lot easier on them. this developers seem to only cater to the needs of the korean players, and pay almost no attention to na.tl;dr:unless you find out a way to play the korean elsword, this is not a game you want to play.",0

2781,"off its true this game has premium planes, ships and tanks, now that we have that out of the way i assure you premium vehicles means absolutely nothing with when talking about in-game effectiveness.i will now only talk about tanks as its what i mainly play this game for.as far as mechanics go its simple, aim and shoot, short barrels have to compensate and long ones don't, if you get hit and the proyectile damages your crew badly you might have to stand still for a bit as you have to swap whoever is still alive (even if you are standing in the middle of nowhere) same if you get your tracks/tires or engine hit, if your cannon is hit you might not be able to shoot until you repair it.any free tank can devastate a premium one with ease, hell, a fast reserve tank can kill high level tanks before they can realise what is happening, tanks are mostly very agile too (even anti-tanks), i sometimes take my stugs into a game to drift for a while and flank enemies (they shouldn't be played like that), it also feels really satisfying to one shot an enemy that just realised was in danger and was about to run off.i also have to say two more things.-first one is these kind of games are for a very specific consumer, not made for everyone (i thought it wasn't made for me either until i tried it out) -second one is that the first tanks you will encounter will be a bother to try and drive/shoot but it'll get much better a few vehicles in.",1

17443,"when i frist started playing everquest 2 it was amazing (its still great). the players were friendly and mature, there were lots of things to do (still is) but now days groups are tough to come by because of the population decline about a year ago (update 6/2/2018: population problems seem to have been evened out due to server merges). the shadow oddesy was the prime of everquest 2 (imo). i suggest playing this, many people have made life long friends and even gotten married irl because of this game. i still have so many great memories from people i played this with, but, bridges have been burned and i cant relive them, so i have to make new ones. it's so sad for me to see so many people i used to play with leave for other mmo's and never return. the best time of my gaming life was when i was playing my main (at the time) on the everfrost server (merged with another server so it isnt call that anymore) in a guild called stormsurge. this is a game where you have to be respectul of other players because there arent millions of people loggin on every day like ff14 or eso. you unknowingly begin making a name for yourself when you begin playing.get this game. maybe you can have great memories like i do. everquest is an mmorpg unlike any other, unriveled in its content. update 6/2/2018: i have been playing eq2 for 10 years. the only reason steam says i have less than 300 hours is because it hasnt been on steam for the full duration of it's release. so if i had to guess i'd say i have around 3000 - 4000 hours on everquest 2.my main is called scuttlebutt and he is on the antonia bayle server. hit me up if you want to play.",1

3441,"ring of elysium is not a bad br game, but it's still beta-ish and needs some work. no true fullscreen (borderless windowed only), devs are working on more compatiblility with streaming / recording software also. the game is optimized fairly well now (i played it back in march and april), it runs on directx9 so older hardware is supported there. vibrant setting for graphics is a big plus for me, and runs well and looks great on my ultrawide 21:9 monitor. devs seem to know what they're doing with fpp so far (added recently). a few bugs here and there but nothing crazy. roe is a free game, so the playerbase should last for a while. some countries are not able to download or play as of release on steam, probably some legal red tape there. they can still use garena launcher to get into the game.i'd say it's worth a download and quick play if you like br games like pubg. it's easy to pick up and play with friends casually or hardcore on fpp servers. solo is okay play, and it's just straight up enjoyable to try out the glider, snowboard, and snowmobile for some funsies!",1

5757,"i'll narrow this down to the good and the bad points about this game. (updated 10/13/2015, shortly after graphics overhaul. [note!] so far these upgrades are not shown in the above screenshots)the good:-a large array of aircraft to fly(if you buy the moduls). many of which are fully interactive, as in almost every switch and button can be flipped with the click of your mouse(you can rebind the keys as you see fit). the rest of the aircraft are more like simplifed simulations, not fully interactive but easier to learn. as far as i know, they handle realisticly.-amazing graphics post update! the lighting, weather, and smoke effects are absurdly good, the ground now uses a bump map, meaning flat textures on the ground cast shadows, it really makes the terrain look a million times better. basically it just looks better and even runs better.-detailed single player campaigns for each and every aircraft, some single player campaigns very in their difficulty and legnth. for example, the a-10a's campaign features smaller scale misisons that don't require much time to complete. where as the su-25's campaign features much larger scale misisons that take much longer to complete(imagine after taking off from your airfield, you must fly for 20-30 minutes to the combat zone, then fly back to land when your mission is complete, which i guess is more realistic).-quick misson generators which allow you to practice with your aircarft before doing the campaigns.-one thing i really like is that you can choose your payload, each aircraft has a large variety of weaponry, and it is fun carefully choosing your payload according your mission objective. variety is such a great thing, and variety is something this game has in large quantities.-the game is very well optimized now, it used to run like garbage even with incredeble hardware, but even after the graphics overhaul, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it did.-the load times have been vastly improved, it used to take 5 minutes to load anything up in this game, now its about 30 seconds to a minute to load. any subsequent load time is around 15 seconds.bare in mind my hardware specs are as follows:amd 8-core 4.0 ghzr9 290 with 4gb of vram gddr512gb 1600mhz of ramthe bad:-expect a minor frame rate dips if our have mirrors and ground clutter active.-the game's training is hit or miss. the su-25t(which you get for free) has training missions that are interactive. then you have most of the flaming cliffs 3 aircraft which have shoddy low res videos, that is out of sync with the sound and voice that is explaining everything. for the mi-8, the game will only teach you how to turn it on, take off, and how to use the weapons, but it only tells you how to use the rockets, and 2 of the 3 types of gun pods, and doesn't teach you how to use bombs. worst of all, it did not teach me how to land with the helicopter, which is harder than you may think. i crashed 40 times trying to figure out how to land properly. the game has a steep learning curve, and the training videos just makes an already hard to learn game even more inaccessible.-i find that the default controles are confusing and clunky. i basically had to completely setup and rebind the contols to something more comfortable. this took a lot of time, learning what each function did, then figuring out what my new layout should be. but when your done, your done and can enjoy the game. keep in mind, you have to completely set up your controles for each indavidual vehicle!in conclusion:if i can add anything more to the review, i will. but overall, the game is great, and i highly reccomend it if you like flight simulators.",1

14310,i have been playing this for many months on my smartphone. i heard that it had been ported to steam and wanted to be able to play it using my steam account. once i provided the correct information the devs linked my account inside of 5 minutes. i was blown away at how fast and effeciant they were. thank you guys for making a good casual game. thank you for fast and responsive support. well done.,1

6940,"absolutely love this game. it's easily my favorite dccg. coming from hearthstone and want to know what sets it apart? this is based on probably a hundred or so hours playing the game using the bethesda launcher. here are the major differences from hearthstone to get you started:1. rewards, in general, are much more generous. this is partly because of point with bigger deck sizes and can have 3 copies of many of the legendaries. you get like 10-50 gold and a spare card (can even be legendary or a pack!) every 3 wins instead of just 10 gold. way better. end of season rewards... i forget how hs works, but you get a ton of gold and soul gems and like 1-3 packs for end of season purely based on what rank you are. in addition, they release a new card every month, and you get 1-3 copies based on your rank as well! 1 copy at rank 9 or better, 2 copies at rank 5, 3 copies at rank 1. you can craft monthly cards anytime after that for ones you've missed, but you'll never find them in packs.2. generally less rng than hs. the randomness that is in the game (for the most part) has some interesting control, and not totally random. the really rng cards typically aren't competitive, but still fun to throw 1 or 2 in your deck at times.3. solo arena. basically like versus arena, but against enemy ai. you earn cards in a similar fashion, same type of 30-card draft, but against enemy ai with random lane and game start effects. rewards are similar to hs as well. guaranteed pack for playing, even if you lose all 3. infinite time to play, this counts for quests. there is no timer for playing, so you can take forever or walk away to do something if you get pulled away. i think you can even log off and it will pick up right where you left off if you join back in. same goes for practice mode, which i'll go into later.4. constructed decks have 50-70 cards, with 1 unique copy of each legendary allowed. if it's not unique (the golden circle at the top of some legendary cards), you can still have 3 copies of a legendary card, or any other card except ones marked unique.5. constructed ladder. you win, you gain a star. lose, you lose a star. however, you can't go down in rank in a given month. you go down to a separate 2-star constellation (rank) called serpent. below rank 5, a bonus round will randomly be in a given match. in that match, the winner gains 2 stars. the loser still loses 1.6. now for the big ones. lanes. there are 2 of them. yippee... you say sarcastically. but really it changes the play a lot more than you'd think. i've heard it helps the defender. left lane is normal. the right lane is, by default, the shadow lane. every creature played here gains cover for one turn. this can be played around and affected. some cards can move, or switch lanes, as part of their lane effects. trust me when i say: 2 lanes are better than 1. i was made a believer.7. the other big one. prophecies and runes. here's where things get really interesting. each player has 5 runes to start the game, at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 health. when your health drops below 25 for any reason, no matter whose turn it is), you draw a card. if it has the prophecy keyword, you get to play the card immediately (even during your opponent's turn), for no magicka cost, if you so choose. you can also choose to put the card in your hand. this rule goes for both players with all decks in every game type. this obviously has huge implications. because there aren't many cards with prophecy, breaking runes in and of itself is an important decision every time. the only exception to this rule and all others is, if any player ever drops below 1 health for any reason on any turn, the game is over. prophecies can be skipped in this way, if 6 damage is done in one attack, the last rune is skipped. knowing what class and colors you're playing against is key to playing around potential effects during your turn. speaking of colors and classes...8. card colors / classes / card synergy / creativity. there are 5 colors, red (strength), green (agility), blue (intelligence), yellow (willpower), purple (endurance), plus neutral (gray). each color has a general theme, but can play any archetype (won't be top tier, but a taste of it). this is for balance, variety, synergy, and creativity. for example, purple cards generally are stickier with slightly higher stats. many green cards are reactive or mobile (can move between lanes). the 10 classes are all combinations of 2 of the 5 colors, plus neutral cards can be in any deck. the summon ability will activate any time that card comes into play, even if another card summons it. this makes for much more card synergy than battlecry in hs, which only activated when the card was played from your hand.9. you can play practice mode to get soul gems. 5 for a win against easy, 10 against normal, 15 against expert. 300 gems per day cap. a legendary every 4 days if you max it. not bad with very fast aggro decks like mono red. you play against a random class with standard lane effects and starting conditions.10. chaos arena is very fun and helps shakes things up once a month for the weekend. random lane conditions and special conditions even on top of that sometimes. it's the first new game mode they've introduced.11. a few new keywords. haven't played hs in a while so some of these may be dupes. breakthrough lets you overkill a creature into their face for damage. pilfer activates any time the creature damages the enemy hero. regenerate brings that creatures current health back to maximum at the beginning of your turn. drain gives your hero back the same amount of health as the attack damage it deals.12. no secrets (prophecies fill that role), but supports instead. these are either limited use or perpetual, until removed. there are a few cards that can remove supports. they typically either buff all your creatures while in play, summon a creature per turn, or buff 1 of your creatures with limited uses.13. a few cards trigger if you have more health than your opponent. you may have noticed that 2 lanes and runes / prophecy tend to favor the defender, but clearly this favors the aggressor to maintain balance. these mighty few let aggro decks maintain momentum through all those extra (and potentially free) cards.14. heroes can never attack. can't equip your hero with items. no hero powers. this makes cards, card draw, and x/1's more valuable since there are fewer ways to kill them without requiring a finite resource.15. card costs in soul gems (shards in hs). legendaries in tesl cost 1200. epics cost 400. rares cost 100. commons cost 40 (i think).",1

13678,"been playing this game for a few good hours trying to unlock every recipe and build cool stuff, after unlocking everything and hit the wall of premium that has no use in thig game everything started to feel like dead and out of interest.the game feels like a copy out of minecraft with a nice resourcepack and with sofisticated/complex crafting that gives this game a big plus, at the same time a minus also if you really want to create things making you miss the creative mode from minecraft.the creatures in the game are to damn easy to kill and feel lifeles compared to minecraft, they tend to bug making them easyer to kill, run in circles around them while slashing.i loved the idea of portals, wow that was cool feature giving a different angle to adventure,the hand that sucks everything out of anything it was better then the medieval pickaxe/shovel/axe/hands,i would probably had more to say but its late and lost my ideas, but i will say this: this game its just an improvement of minecraft, that doesnt mean it has anything to do with it, while it has many bugs and exploits available the game is fun but due to its complex nature it makes it abit boring after a while especially when you want to do it in scale, but thank you extractors/bombs/excavators now we only need x-ray(not really). but after you unlocked and did everything the game feels like finishing a game in story mode and thats it compared to minecraft where even if it get boring at least you can find something to do(but this is just my opinion), the mechanical part and decoration keeps you up to the task.to bad you cant find servers with more then 5 players making the game more for friends/groups/etc rather then for a new comer ,the end, i wouldve said more but as i mentioned before lost my ideas, plus i am not good with writing reveiew , rather discuss them.",1

5835,"hello,this game is a piece of art. some say it is the best mil avio sim there is out there. even with its free module you will find yourself capapble of doing many tasks and missions (using the wide weaponary). but don't think you will be able to hop in the game and start doing all the ace manuevers and tactics. you will have to put your mind to it and approach it with the atitude of learning new stuff. game is in no mean necessary to be played as if you are a real pilot. you can take it casualy, but you will still need to take notes and be patient. the feeling of reward after succeding is huge. after you master the frog, you can try out some of the other modules and see what suits you. you might be a ground pounder or a fighter guy. or maybe a rotor head ? you can go back and fly some of the older gen planes as well. new modules are being brought out often.some tips i have are:- take notes !!! - get a stick (even a cheaper one)- get yourself a headtracker (trackir, facetrack(homemade trackir)- as much as you all love steam, i recommend getting the standalone game as you will be able to use all the avaliable mods on the forums (terrain, texture, sound, liveries) - register on the forums so you can see what new content there is from the community ( mods, screens, vids, news and projects) if you are using a single monitor i recommend playing the game in windowed mode(it is borderles so you wont see a diff) as it allows you to alt+tab a lot easier without any issues and last but not in meaning. if you ever have time, check out the mission editor tool. it is a powerful tool where you can unleash all the imaginary missions you ever had. has lurning curve as anything in this game.i've been flying the a-10c for 3 years(nearly 4) now and f-15c for year and a half and i am happy with the amount of time i've inversted in this. don't be scared that you won't be able to do something or it is too complicated. no such thing. if anyone wans help or tips for those two modules i could help out :) cheers and see you in the sky. shoutout to the 104th server, the best pvp server !p.s: if you wonder why i have so low game time. it is because i play the standalone version. i downloaded the game on steam just so i can write this review.don't be scared to ask me any questions about the a-10c and f-15c",1

7961,well i played neverwinter for about a week and started to get into it and then the quest tracking system broke for me. i just can no longer track any quests which used to show me where to go to resolve my quests - or even start new ones. it gives me an error message saying cannot find path to the quest from current location or something along those lines - on every quest - no matter where i am. this world is far too large for me to just guess where to go - so it's effectively a game breaking bug for me. i've looked for solutions and found that many other people have the same problem but nothing they've tried (from uninstalling the entire game and re-downloading it again which took days for me) to just starting over with an all new character work for me. so i guess it's just not playable.,0

8099,"an mmo with a great active combat system, lengthy and robust progression, rich lore from the grandaddy of rpgs itself! sounds good right? well yes, this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive.so where does it go wrong? honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole, now being an mmo errors and problems will surely show up from time to time, i mean they're called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldn't expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems. examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to one-hit-kill endgame bosses, attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers (which allows them not to be hurt) or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few.along side the numerous comabt exploits are those have allowed players to gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited. the exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to, some are still present. next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to mmos but the path that these developers take with them is, which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so.last but not least is the f2p model that they use which before module 6 i didn't really have a huge problem with, whilst i did spend more than enough money on this game pre-module 6 it was more of a luxury than a necessity. now with what i have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module 6 upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement pay to win feels like it has made it's way here. when all is said and done i did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new mmo as in it's current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money. instead what i would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an xbox one is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and it's community whereas the pc staff seem to barely listen to their playerbase on the whole.",0

12051,"do not buy in the current state. thankfully, i was able to obtain a refund after 17 hours of game time.it's been a good two days and nothing notable has been done by the bless team to fix the plethora of issues the game faces. i cannot recommend this to anyone until the devs fix a huge majority of their issues. they've got a really huge wall in front of them to overcome if they are to hope to succeed.after giving the bless team some time (since ea launch 2 days ago) to iron out their issues, nothing notable has been done to address the plethora of issues that it is facing.the issue that everyone faces is the incredibly poor performance - both server side and client side. in addition to that, frequent maintenance & server crashes worsen the experience (but of course, this is to be expected for any mmo launch). fps wise without the player-made tweaks, i got below 30 fps in towns and a frequent below 40 fps outside of towns (my rig runs gtx1080, 16 gb ram, i7-6700). on a side-note, there have been guides written by players (not developers) to help alleviate the fps issues which work to some extent but still does not help the experience too much (and rightfully, it should be the devs who published the guide or patch to address this issue, not the players).gameplay wise, it is not what one would expect for a price tag of 30/40 usd (and above) - the entire world is unpolished. dialogue, quests and plot are poorly written and boring. animations are blocky and unpolished. sound effects are horrible (sounds like what i would get from an indie game) - voice acting is worse. i did a level 31 dungeon that had a cooldown of a couple of minutes which makes absolutely no sense in an mmorpg that requires you to grind for levels and loot. loot in dungeons with a party follows the traditional bid system and does not prioritize giving the item to the correct classes. another gripe i have with the game is that if a player tags a field mob first, the mob's rewards are his and only his.i grinded to mid-endgame thinking that the game would be more fun then, but it isn't - it's the same thing, except with field pvp (and people ganging up to get kills).the combat system has potential, but isn't quite there yet. i enjoyed being able to have options to chain my combos into - based on what i wanted and how i planned to attack. however, the two most blatant frustrations that i have (and other players too) are:1. missing an attack would completely reset the combo.2. using a non-stance ability would reset the combos. this is incredibly painfully frustrating for me. coming from ff14 where we have off-gcd abilities, i cannot fathom as to why the developers would decide that using a non-stance ability should reset the combos. that makes it incredibly counter-intuitive to use any of your non-stance abilities - which means you either use them before you start combos or at the end of the combos only. so why would i want to blink mid-fight if i cannot for-the-love-of-god chain my high-damage combos or stuns? why would i want to cast counterspell when it completely disrupts my combo? if you have played league of legends before, imagine you're yasuo, you have 3 stacks of gathering storm (q) and you're going to go in for the huge knockup play, but you have to flash to get in range - but wait, flashing completely removes your 3 stacks and you can't knockup anymore. neowiz, why?the combo resets make it seem as if the devs have not play-tested the combat enough, or even knowledgeable/talented enough to understand what constitutes a good and smooth combat flow.besides that, the game could do with an innate dodge ability besides the one non-stance ability you equip. blinking should also not lock your movement (there's a short 0.5? second delay before you can move again) after usage.the skill/talent tree (whatever it was called) was confusing and poorly designed. it had combat stats, exp stats, gold stats all mixed into the same tree. it is also a linear skill tree for each of the four paths which makes it incredibly boring. leveling the skills / abilities / talents used some form of currency which i'm not sure how to obtain except from rewards through quests - not via leveling, which is really confusing (at least for me).crafting was.. meh. few crafting options, and lots of the materials i did not know how to obtain so i did not even bother much with crafting. i crafted some baguettes and a necklace only and gave up on the rest.repairing / enhancing / taming - tedious and confusing.besides that, another unacceptable issue is that the localization is incredibly poorly done - the worst i have seen for a game i have ever paid for. i cannot figure out most of my skills due to the poor translation. also, a prime example of poor localization is that the mailbox receive button is translated to gift - yes, gift which is supposed to be the button you click to receive items from the mail. it's as if they simply threw their localization strings into google translate, plopped it into the game and never looked at it again.another opinion i have is that the outfit design is really bland and boring - even those on the cash shop. i did not find even 1 outfit to my liking.i had thought they would be able to iron out all the issues by launch day (or planned & shared a roadmap or informative post to address the issues) but it seems i was mistaken. all they have ever done is just post on character creation restrictions, adding new servers, maintenances and a notice that they were aware of server issues. then, they had the nerve to post about game balance (healing not as potent as damage) when the fundemental issues that actually allow for a smooth gaming experience weren't even addresed.what i liked:1. character creation - good. it's good and has lots of customization options. i only didn't like the voice options, otherwise it's pretty solid.2. combat - kinda. i had fun with the combat except for the few setbacks and frustrations i had mentioned above.tldr;the bad:1. bad performance - fps (30 & below on a good rig) & server lag.2. poor gameplay - lackluster quests / storyline / dungeons.3. bad audio - poor sound quality & bad voice acting.4. disappointing combat - combos being cancelled/reset by missed attacks & usage of any non-stance abilities.5. horrible localization - the worst i have ever seen. everything seems to be taken from google translate.6. no roadmap/plans from devs on issue fixes.7. (opinion) bland & boring outfits.8. other issues faced by other players such as friends not being able to get in the same server and them getting their items server & character bound.the good:1. character creation has lots of customization options except i didn't like the voices.2. combat feels fun at first because of the many available combo-chain options but fails to impress later on due to the frustrating mechanics (see point 4 above).thank you for reading and sorry for the incredibly long rant.",0

26282,"> mojority of games have character customisation aka both genders a great deal still don't. there are tons of games that have little to no customization.> edit: was it even a thing? i couldnt find anything about it.you got me there, i totally forgot the name of the game. i was thinking harvest moon. i apologize for the error and have now corrected it with an edit.> its also done to male characters just in different way as they are marketed to female audience which means egy bois, daddys, guys with 24packs on their stomach etc you can check the newest creations from league of legends or genshin impact it's true that some games are slowly introducing a little of this now. but most sex appeal characters are still female, and it is *incredibly* rare to find a mainstream game where *all* the male characters are meant to be eye candy for straight women. very easy to find games where all the female characters are there as eye candy. the exception is garbage mobile games, which do sometimes try to appeal exclusively to women.> nobody does that... it doesnt make sense weaker characters doesnt sell well. supporting is not female character only thing. not even talking about how support characters dont need to be weak by any means :vthe weaker characters aren't there to sell the game, they're there to give you something to protect. it is true that support characters aren't by definition ineffective, but most of them do lack the ability to be effective solo. i love support characters, but there's a problem when that's seen as a role for women. think of it like cooking. cooking is great, useful, and fun. but when you're told that the role of a good wife is to support your husband by cooking for him, that's not so great. it's like that.for a random example, see the game ico. now let me be clear- i love ico to death. but it does play into this trope. yorda (female) is physically weaker than ico and cannot defend herself, relying on ico to protect her. > okey i would like to ask wtf are you playing? like what? where? which game?i'll admit this one is more popular in movies and tv shows, where it can get pretty darn extreme. but it does show up in games from time to time, where you'll sometimes see villains that will make sexual threats towards women but never towards men.",1

9511,"note: most of my experience comes from playing on the browser version of this game.realm of the mad god (rotmg) is a player versues environment bullet hell shooter experience combined with loot galore, infused with an retro 8 bit art style. there is emphasis on group roles but not enforced upon players who like the lone wolf playstyle. the game jumpstarts after a stress-free tutorial. being free to roam the realm that you have been spawned into.you survey the beach-like enviroment being attacked by your first few encounters, as a wizard you strike back, perhaps even spellbomb completing your first quest. then adventuring on inland. the quest for level 20 begins which may take some time. it probably won't be long until the death screen greets you, being killed by said reason. then one is probably gripped onto the fully realised experience of perma-death within the game and perhaps either hooked to the progression that one can achieve. or straight out quitting. only to perhaps return later at another date. it is this continous cycle of life and death that causes the game to be extremely replayable, to the point of stagnation for some.gameplay is fairly straight forward. core controls being wasd keys for movement, spacebar for ability and right clicks to shoot. a simple glance at the settings can further tweak these controls, as well as realise other crucial bindings like the nexus key- a key to return yourself to safety from critical moments. like the nature of most bullt-hell shooters, dodging is seen crucial, as to keep your hp bar healthy. having it drop below 0 would equate to the death of that character- no respawn of that now deceased character. of course your character can shoot back projectiles towards specified enemies, including melee characters, relative to actually ranged characters. making new entry players having to worry not of controls, but fixate on the more interesting aspects of the game itself. the active gameplay, and dancing around projectiles. classes fit the usual archetypes from mmorpg's such as tanks, healers and damage dealers. they can be sperated into weapon classes, then further into unique abilities. which bring about a unique style of combat to each character. each having their own strengths and weaknesses. featuring 8 stat values that can be upgraded to a max value that are different for each character class ---> x/8. maxing being one of the game objectives, causing your character to become stronger---> 8/8. at first being unmaxed can be considered playing legendary, to being maxed brings it down to herioc. then having a maxed out divine pet (a goal for some) makes the game normal/easy difficulty. rotmg tries to intice its players into a difficult but appealing nature of diffuculty. rewarding those who continue to stay and overcome the challenges and obstacles of the game. upon reaching level 20. fame collecting becomes another game objective, attempting to pin the tales of that characters onto the competitive leaderboards. a numerical value to illustrate the lifespan of your character. it derives from completing quests, achievements and just playing the game.the game features peer to peer trading, the many dungeouns that drop from certain creatures, realm events that spawn in order to allow the encounter of facing the iconic face of the game. these methods allow for progression in terms of gear as well as stat increase potions. which also lead to being used as trading currency apart from untiered gear which is soulbound and so cannot be traded. based on supply and demand this style of currency, makes the game fairly integrated into loot grinding of valuable items, that other players may want to trade for. microtransactions are evident, only serving as a method to perhaps skip through the farming part of rotmg only to bring dissatisfaction in addition to the risk of perma death . fortunately these are not completely forced upon gameplay-wise- only advertised. skill is seen more of a determining factor in the game. only really restrictions are perhaps having limited character and vault storage slots for the non-buyer. for those who seek for a story-driven game, rotmg will feel lacking. its loosely overlapping story is somewhat for the interpretation of the player. it will be the gameplay which entices the player. the focus on action, with unique encounters. requiring players to figure out and pattern recognise the many attack phases of the encounter. conquering such will yield respectable reward. the style of realm is blocky and cool, and should appeal to those who love the retro theme. worlds are split into numerous realms all connected to a nexus point. these realms could house up to 85 players, with no requiriment of setting up needed parties. although guilds do exists. experience is granted to all nearby players. quality loot is soulbound when it does drop (only seen by player). players are generally grinding for their own gains of wealth of some sort. but naturally players work together to take down tougher quests. realms present different regions that represent levels of difficulty. heading inland to godland being the most dangerous. this co-operative nature of the game allows for each and every chacter to shine contributing to the main group allowing for synergy. even the rogue class (its ability to rush through dungeouns to the boss, can be invaluable to the group).the game can be frustrating, annoying and depressing after each and every death especially after x amount of time invested into a character. yet dancing in the realms of the mad gods can be fun. just the nature and intense gameplay dynamics of having to constantly dodge and shoot. that sense of exhilarating action, packed into several pixels. lootbags of dropping of various quality, to provide that incentive to continue for more. co-operating with other players without the hassle of setting up parties. through each death taking each and every bit of experience to the next reborn character. only to perhaps beat the records of your previous attempt.i can recall several earlier positive memories being naive to the gameplay especially at the start, where the game world would be so vast, but commiting time to understand it. having friends to tag along with, can make the journey incredibly enduring. the journey(grind) to the end goals of the game, could be said the best parts of the game experience. as the closer to end game, the less fun it can be. having already experienced everything already by then.regardless i have to sometimes ask myself how death could be so gripping?",1

9200,"overall impressionsi've been told that this game is great from launch and time and time again from post-hype patches. between getting blasted from a line of fire to heal another soldier in battle and getting spawnkilled from a sunderer to jump into battles, my poor experience from the game has yet to mature into something great. i will admit, planetside 2 has a lot of content to cover in the first couple of hours. there's just so much to learn on top of the fact that everyone seems to know what they're doing, but as for scrawny me, i didn't know about the training area until four hours in, and i clearly don't quite recall on the amount of depth the game had to offer between character, weapon, and vehicle customization from the trailers. not only do you as a character get to customize the kinds of weapons you would like in terms of a playstyle, but each of these loadouts contain a perk that you can choose to add-on, along with other smaller add-ons onto your vehicle. in addition, the weapons you equip and their inner machinations are something you can choose to change. these changes aren't for nought, of course. they do, in fact, change the game. that said, if you're a player who wants to jump in and get a fun engagement within the span of 15 minutes like most korean f2p shooters, this is not for you. spawn times feel slow and deliberate, even if it is only 15 seconds. instant action consistently warps you into different locations, and don't even get me started ont travelling between each zone. when stalemates hit on a heavy day, these battles last longer than a typical infantry-only match in battlefield 3. you have to do your research on the game. as i mentioned earlier, i didn't play very well. i'm certain that is a primary result of it. if you want to play well in the game, there's certainly the whole aimng and shooting aspect of it, but there's a lot more than just that, and many of the players account for this whilst being in the battle.all of that in mind, if you know you want to put a lot of time into not being productive, this is the game for you.",1

4572,"i know my steam play time is low but i've been playing this game for a solid amount of time before this released here and i love it so much. this is from someone who hated mobas and everything about them but i was a bit curious and thought that smite seemed like a good entry point and since then this has been the only game i consistently play. the gods are all so cool and the mythology adds a fun layer with the characters plus actually seeing the skins you have on your god is pretty great. the motd is a fun addition because it spices things up a little if you don't want to play a traditional game mode, which smite has a solid amount of. the daily log in bonus is great because i haven't spent a penny on this game and i have a bunch of gods and skins and ward skins and icons. if you're someone who doesn't like mobas i would suggest you give this one a try because it might just click for you. that all being said, it seems the steam version might be a bit iffy right now so you may want to wait and download it from hi rez, either way, i hope you play this game.",1

14119,"not only at how many hours i've now, but based on how many i have played (even before steam release), i think i can write a honest review.first of all, this is a great game with lot's of potential, that's why i've been playing it for quite a time.but the developers on this game decided to make it even more painfull for new or beginning players, to enjoy the game.as you know, in this game you can buy items with game dollars, gc and bandage dx. in the latest patch of januari they decided to remove the dx as a currency, and all dx above 1000 were exchanged for game dollars. which made it almost impossible to buy snipers or gear from the store. because of the ridiculous high prices.second of all, they reduced drops from super zombies and from loot crates etc.it was hard to get loot, not only because the pve servers are always full and renting a private server has been disabled for over 3-4 months, but because once you spawn in all the people are:- full geared- clans from 3 to 11 people- have trained skilltree so they have a small advantage- have better weapons or attachments to kill you easily.with that being said about adventages, the biggest adventage is that it's pay to win.you can buy credits with real money, exchange it for skins or skinboxes or dx, trade it for all kinds of gear. and tadaaa! you now have a full global inventory, and you never need to worry about losing items.that's not the game it used to be, and it's really sad to see it has come to this.i hope i made clear why you shouldn't invest time or money in this game, as it only rewards you with an empty global inventory, or an empty wallet.small summary of pro's and con's.pros:- cool and unique pvp- clan system is unique- killstreaks are being rewarded with more cash- reputation system, rewards you for killing bandits or -rep, or give you negative rep if you kill civilians or +rep- you can find all sorts of items across map.cons:- really low and small loot for a server like this. (no snipers and almost no crates.)- too many clans or friends teaming up.- every server there is different pvp city.- spawning in an other map teleports your character to a new random location (you can never use 1 character on multiple maps without spawning at a random locatian everytime you spawn.)- pay to win (all advantages you get for being premium are just too many)- skill cap is too high, (you have beginner servers, but only someone with 0 kills and below 72 hours can play on it)- premium servers pvp with cars (yes i know, it's ing but the hitbox is just so big)- hackers and laggers all over the place- haven't i said enough to convice you not to play this game?anyway, i hope this review helps you considering to play this game yes or no.thanks for reading!",0

14107,"well, i've been playing newz on its own launcher (off of steam) for approximately one year or so, this game has its ups and downs. first off, i wish there were less skins, and more focus to adding more content rather than expanding the current with re-skins. this game can be extremely fun, especially when playing with a group of buddies and having a blast pvp'ing (gotta get that adrenaline flowing for harambe, boys.), but other times it's just spawn-die, and then repeat that process which is uttely dissapointing. fredaikas and the team have put a lot of time and effort into newz, with one of the most outstanding anticheats i've seen (mlg anticheat) on any game based off the games source, and lots of neat features that i can't even spend all my time writing. if you don't like the game and seriously came here just to write a review because it's like warz.. blah then you can take your two cents and shove it where the sun doesn't shine! of course it's like warz, it's the same god damn source, it's upsetting that people can't appreciate all the work they've done in such a short period of time unlike the hp dev's. i appreciate the time the dev team has put into making a source that had a terrible coding structure and making it somewhat decent and playable.overall rating: 7/10",1

14377,"the game was a lot better back in 2014 but the development team are amatuers at best. failure to learn from their mistakes (and there are many) which has been proven again and again over the 2 years of updates i've suffered playing this game.match making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players. the outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design. the problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in 2015 (battle arena update) which broke the game (overclocking mechanic) and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times. the removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system, just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together. this relates to the poor match making.mega bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them. mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve.failure to add key features for the community like clans (this could make the game if they bothered to implement it)they treat the players/customers with little consideration when they release major changes. often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws.they only care about new players who spend real money. membership exists but it offers such poor value i suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer. if you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year. spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility.the most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item. the items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price. effectively you can grind the free to play model, convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crates/items for real money at extortionate rates. they have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players. this game is now looking more like 'free to install' and 'pay to compete'",0

15666,"as it says, this is an early access review. in other words, the game will improve over time. if you don't wish to play the game when it's incomplete, you aren't suitable for beta testing or any testing for that matter. stay away from this currently incomplete game. (you have been warned).just like every other ae game, this has the same concept. farming. it's extremely grindy, like seriously. if you hate any form of grinding or too much grinding, then stay away as well.there are new features such as crafting and now even the pumpkin lord armour is farmable. which is a great step forward for non-p2p players. in other words, it is more farmy and less cashy. just like how an ae game should be.for anyone that complained that the pumpkinlord armour is too hard to farm due to low levels joining in the dungeon, they have capped it and is now much more easy.a new area has been released and guess what? more farming! before anyone starts complaining that the hard area is too hard, it's probably because you're too low level. (basically a newbie. not an insult here.)i take back my previous statement about levels being less important though. they are super important because the best armour currently available in game is level 15.if you're new to ae games, i really don't recommend this because the story does not flow. yes. ae games are made in such a way that if you never played any other games made by them, the story will feel very weird and rushed. as a long time player of all their games, i can say that their lore is extremely deep. for example, the plot twist about artix and gravelyn actually makes sense. if you looked back at their past storyline, you'll actually see why. sepulchure's backstory is personally my favourite (and the way he died t^t)basically, if you want to start on this game, play all of its prequels.if you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how ae games work, you will have a 50% chance of either loving it, or hating it.",1

15796,"a developer from artix entertainment had requested reviews from players after only being in open beta for one hour which is a bit of a joke but i have enough to make a review so here it is.quick review for those with more time on your hands.is it worth playing: not really there are better games out there for free unless you intend to play on tablet or androidhow would you rate it out of 10? : a solid 4 its a game equivilant of meh would i recommend to others : nope id suggest playing adventure quest worlds instead is it a lot better constructed considering it is a sider scrolling web based game.---the first and biggest issue is the fact that this game was originally aimed at pc players of aqworlds as the next aq game and yet they spent so much time making the controls work for mobile/tablet users that they have forgotten how make it interesting for pc players. character customization : it is pretty standard and not a lot of variations even with the added barber shop into the game so not alot to talk about there.the pathing and quest system are a joke because as of right now after you finish the tutorial you and just smack bang in this town that you are expected to know the layout and locations of everything with just random npcs offering you quests for npcs that you cannot find by a tracker or even in the quest information. so you are literally screwed from the word *go* and if you have no prior experience of the game you are screwed.now onto monsters : at the moment of writing this it is in open beta so its to be expected that things need to be worked out, but currently i was dealing 1/5th of the damage i was being dealt by monsters of the same level as myself and for the sake of arguements i was a fully geared warrior so it makes zero sense that i should be getting destroyed by one monster as the same level as me.combat system: this is where i believe that artix entertainment has done quite well for themselves because the actual animations of the attacks are quite good so in that regards i commend them but due to the long drawn out animations it would seem that where i as the player would get one special move off the opposing monster/s will be able to get 2 or even 3 attacks off therefore rendering my damage pointless because they have caught up to my damage spike and even done some more which inturn requires me to demolish my supplies of potions that i have/had.ui/menu : again i honestly think artix entertainment has really done well on the ui and menu system, for a phone or tablet game, there is no need to restrict pc users to such a simplistic and just empty screen and weirdly enough they have locked the chatbox to the topleft of the screen even though ther is nothing else on the bottom left, which is another indication that they only thought about phone and tablet users.sounds and music : i think the music is alright not the best but what the hell its better than nothing am i right ? but when looting or attacking it suddenly gets extremely loud and every time you loot a monster it is preset to make the sound of a chest opening when your opening a bag, now thats just lazy because it doesnt take a lot of time to make 2 different sounds for different containers of items that monsters will drop. the attacking noises are extremely loud for really no reason in really random areas, such as making that trademark *sheen* noise when it is swung but it is so loud if you really want to listen to it id highly recommend making the sound very low.",0

11525,"in my limited time playing black squad, it has a lot of potential to be a great game, so here are a list of good and things they can improvepros- it's not a pay2win game. a lot of f2p games allow you to buy better weapons leaving the guys who don't want to spend money at a huge disadvantage. this game is spot on towards competing without disadvantages towards those who don't spend money on ingame items. there are skins and such to buy ingame but does not give advantages to anyone else.- sounds are really good, the footsteps are loud so sneaking around is usually the best way to gobattle (gamemode) is a very intense and fun gamemode to play- most guns are pretty balanced- demolition (gamemode) is really fun - it's free to playthings to improve- the blazer (sniper rifle) is really overpowered in that it's mobility is really high for a one-shot kill. if they reduced movement speed and make it more of a stationary weapon rather than a run and gun one-shot kill then i think that would balance it- when observing (dead/spectating) teammates, it's hard to tell which is a teammate and which is an enemy. i suggest putting a highlight over teammates much like in csgo so people know who's an enemy and who's not. also keeping the minimap up while observing would be beneficial for players that use 3rd party communication services (discord, mumble, teamspeak) to help make callouts to teammates - in demolition (gamemode) bomb timer is 40 seconds and the defuse is 7 seconds. the maps are fairly large and as a peacemaker (defender) will take a while to clear areas and get to the bomb to defuse. the percentage of winning a round as a peacemaker, especially when stuck at a disadvantage (1v2) and on the other side of the map, is really low. if they increase the timer to say 50 or 60 seconds it would still be competitive and give the peacemakers a chance to win the round. either increase the bomb timer or decrease defusal/plant time.- would like to see some more gamemodes (maybe capture the flag, etc)- obviously this is still early access but with time i'd like to see more weapons and cooler, more aesthetically pleasing animations when inspecting weapons- not too big a deal, but adding in-game microphone would be beneficial when playing gamemodes such as demolition where communication is key- map design is good not great, basic map styles. some have too many openings it's hard as a peacemaker to navigate where the enemies are. keeping it simple will make the game flow much betteroverall this is a fun game that i hope will continue to update and get better.",1

4024,"team fortress 2i would say after spending at least 1k hours on this game, it has an interesting and well desgined set up towards competeive team fights. as well as creating a goofy and entertaining enviorment that is customizable to a certain degree.the game demands a heavy amount of teamwork towards objectives on maps. however at the same time, value has assesed the true interest of the game. killing enemy players. this has been provided through arena modes, team competions, and a decent amount of maps that allow the player the simply enjoy themself within the enviroment given. the game itself provides an exellent way of assisting new players, such as coaching which has an experienced player go out of their way in order to help new players. in doing so, experienced players are rewarded. however, this is what value has done in order to assist new players.the community can be extremely harsh when it comes to new players. new players are easily identifed via not having any hats, having a hat that is easily accessaible via achievement, or simply inexperience. these players are looked down upon within the community due to their lack of understand towards certain events where players may be trying to do something outside of the common norm within the game and a new player disturbing it. it is also laid out that new players do not understand how to assist a team greatly, even sometimes ruining a game.in my opinion, i believe that it would be benefical to most of the community that new players were to take some time to figure out classes, look up online tutorials towards how you should play your class, even take some time to face agianst hard bots. an easy way to not be quickly looked down upon, targeted for pranks, is to simply buy a universal hat. this will give players the idea that you may not be 'free to play' so to speak. though other than being targeted because of inexperience, the community can be quite...interesting. it all depends towarsd how you go about putting yourself out into the community.though this game provides a large variety of assests that protain towards the entiertainment needs of the vast majority of gamers through third party resources such as custom modders, map designers and much more.in conclusion, i would find that this game is extremely fun, only if you can put together how you can do it well. where exactly you may fit in with the community itself. if you find the right place to be, you can find yourself playing this game for a long time.",1

4924,"i have played this game for 701 hours and 2 years now. i've tried this game competitively, i have reached the highest ranks (as far as my region goes). i've spent close to $50 dollars on this game. here is what i think of this game.brawlhalla is one of those games that you will tremendously enjoy. it's got several different game modes, competitive, casual and private options for multiplayer. it's got a training room which has expansive options for learning how to play the game. this game has one of the best developers working behind it. they even have their own esports department, and tournaments are featured on the main menu frequently. loads of options that you can have when playing this game free to play. you will have fun playing this game: if you're looking to play casually. spend maybe 60 great, intense hours with your friends! download this game if this applies to you. however to the 40% of the population who wants to try this game to reach the top, read on.playing ranked is whole different game. although it has a great esports scene, this game is severely broken and terrible at the high levels. the main problem is this: there is no punishment for running away. what makes a fighting game a fighting game is that two opponents are essentially forced to battle out in an arena, with intense action and adreneline everywhere. however, in brawlhalla at the highest ranks, you're essentially trying to bait each other out and parry. defensive play is the only option if you want to win the game. let me put it this way: a good story has a beginning, conflict, rising action, climax and a resolution. in brawlhalla, although there is conflict, it's often either you chasing someone, you losing to someone who waits for you to attack first, or you doing the above. there is no rising action. so when a match finally ends, is more like a flop. this game will feel terrible and there's nothing you can do about it. some weapons are incredibly overpowered as well. the developers do not make a good attempt at trying to make all styles of plays and weapons viable. like the disaster game which is league of legends, there's always a pool of weapons and legends that are considered top tier, before they are pulled off. where as some weapons make reading very hard (10+ different options to escape and punish back), some weapons feel like 50-50 or you lose the entire game.in essence, brawlhalla is a fun an excellent game that should be played with many of your friends. it's almost guaranteed you will have a great time. however, this game lacks extremely at the higher level. just look at a clip from a tournament that happened yesterday: a pro player (has earned money from this game), actually tweeted midgame, because his opponent resolved to a style where he was just waiting for punishes. . trust me, this is how 60% of all matches turn out.tl;dr: it's an excellent game for playing casually. don't invest time into it if you're going to play ranked.",1

3267,"okay so. i have been heavily enjoying this game and i've been doing well if i do say so myself. the game i feel has a lot of potential and i hope that more people do decide to pick up the game and start playing it more than the other standard br games right now. there are a lot of pros and cons that i can think of for this game but, for the sack of time i am just going to list a few.pros:1. class selection - i think that this is one of my favorite options in the game. being given the ability to pick between a paraglider, mountain climbing kit, and a snowboard along with a free minor weapon setup to start the game up is just wonderful and i think allows everyone to have an equal fighting chance in the beginning of the match.2. weapon play - now i won't say that it is as good as pubg's weapon play but, i will say that it is damn good for what it is, and i hope that a lot more people realize this as well. i do think that it needs some adjusting cause i do think that there is some latency between bullets when fighting or just bad hitbox registration because there have been a few not many but, a few times where i have dead centered a sight down on someone not moving and it just miss for no reason at all.3. lastly, for the pros map size - i feel like this is a very comfortable map size for what has been given to us. especially with all the class selection options we get that allows us to traverse the map even quicker. cons:1. sound clarification - i have a really hard time distinguishing where i am being shot from. there were a few instances where i just simple could not figure out where the player was shooting from because i just couldnt pinpoint the area of which the sound was resonating. there was one major instance where i was being shot from a house a block down but, it sounded like the player was damn near next to me.2. minor glitching - i don't know if these are just glitches within the game or just game smoothing issues but, ive had several matches where i died because when i swapped back to a different weapon it showed i was on that weapon selected but, in all reality was a completely different weapon. the last game that i just played i used a grenade swapped to a shotgun and it showed that my shotgun was selected but, in fact it was still my grenade and i feel like this is something that really needs to be fixed.3. hitboxes - i feel like the player hitboxes could be worked on just a tiny bit more in my honest opinion, for most i feel like its comfortable but, as the game moves forward i would like the hitboxes to become a lot better and the hit registration to become a lot more accurate.that about wraps it up for my review i don't do these very often but, this is a great game and i really believes that it deserves more publicity. i feel like with some content updates and patching that this game could become a gem and become just a popular as fortnite and pubg but, thats a long stretch and really depends on how hard you all want to work on the game. overall 7.5/10",1

3047,"the greed of these devs has always been impressive. they do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. at tier 4 and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.and worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. so once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.with ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.but of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.coming back to the game, i wanted to try out this new pve tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. the problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. and to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.on top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total a 1.0 rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. in air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have 2-3 times the weaponry. in ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. in naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0

(maybe slightly different, but still the same - like most of my friends who are women don't worry that their man will leave them because they lose their job, but they do worry that their man will leave them because they lose their good looks, which can be equally as random and unpredictable or health-related. at the end of the day though, the base of these worries is the same, what if something changes and my partner leaves me? how will i know if my future spouse will stay with me through struggles? there's no guarantee for anyone. which sucks, but it also means that most people who want a genuine relationship are stressed about the same things, and hope to work towards the same sort of faithful stability. so you're definitely not alone in your feelings. idk, this has become a wall of text now, but i just hope you know you're not alone feeling that way and hope this helps you feel better somehow. of course, i also just wish there weren't so many shitty people out there that we all have to be so concerned about stuff like that :(",1

8708,"18 october 2018 - the latest patches seem to be more inline with what most players and i wished. the return of the class based gameplay, more weapons and multiple balance changes (still far from perfect) seem to try to pull this game to a better direction than the patches mentioned in the wall of text underneat.while the patches still have some glitches or bugs, they seem to be trying it to listen to the community feedback and to the fledged player base. or at least that's what they want to portray.if it is too late to save realm royale we will see. at the moment is on the verge of being declared an unnoficial online dead game, but seems to start building some traction yet again. it is far from being what it was in terms of playerwise or balance but is it going somewhere. q's ar e still long with sometimes 10 minutes q and only 2 regions (eu/na). hit registration with projectile weapons seem to behave worse if you are not playing on your preffered region, even if ping wise it feels the same as before.the direction the game seems to go now could change at any moment, if hi-rez decides that this is not racking on the money or the player base.for the moment i will change my review to recommended to try. it is not a fully recommended title but if you want a free decent battle royale you can get into it.an oppinion from a hardcoring decent realm royale playerone of the few br games i actualy felt good playing it regularly, competitvely. it was a unique take on battle royale that got under the radar for many gamers but i managed to catch it and get involved. while it wasn't for everyone it was something unique that i really enjoyed playing. the playerbase was not really big but you could get matches in a matter of minutes if not seconds. the game even being wacky and sometimes unbalanced or had some what the hell happened there still kept me in and wanting to do play it more.i played pubg like a lot, but never involved myself in the game, the market or the genre like in realm royale. it felt close to perfect experience, downed down by some inconsistencies, slow developing time and too few classes and weapon variety.when i wished for variety i never expected that this is how realm royale will become. after some controversial, unnannounced, untested patches went straight to live, or to live after 1 day of existance on pts i was skeptical about the development cycle, but afterhuge community backlash, they kind of modified the patch and removed the issues, even if was a bit later than wished.while the gameplay becaim a bit stale in the last patches, people playing metas and the to op engineer, at least for squads, i still enjoyed it and was a blast of fun times and rage times playing with the people on discord. i still was drawn in.unfortunately, erez (ceo of hirez) decided that realm royale is bringing money and it could do even more if they pull in some players. the choice of pulling in some people was made in detrimental to all actual and old realm royale players who put money into it, and was also detrimental to the complete realm royal formula and to everything the game standed for. uniqueness. realm royale became a complete different game on pts and now on live, one that tries to emulate experience from an amalgan of battle royale games that have a big number of players actively.while the community complained and tried to provide feedback about what is wrong about the patch and how they should bring the old realm royale experience back, or at least try to make some adjustments to the game that is as of now completely different, hirez (erez) decided to push the patch live. the patch portrayed bugs from previous versions of realm royale and even lack of animations or legendary abilities that are or were at the time of writing this broken.also, erez ceo of hirez, recently insulted a high profile if not the highest profile streamer, competitive player of realm royale who was commentating in a negative manner about the last patches. erez posted to the live streamer: play the game the way you are supposed to, with a team and stop crying.the direction of how this game went from an almost overnight sensation to a decent player base and now to a complete mess, is abysal. while i think that the (old) game could have been decently present in the market with some changes, new content drops and events, now, i am afraid that the game will die before it even gets out of early access.the console version has been put on hold, and the duos or solos in the pc live environment is momentarly a work in progress after it has been pulled out of the game, in order to make it more competitive.queue times are still decent at peak online times when both eu and na population is live, but when trying to play on eu when eu is on sleep or trying to play on na when most of na is away or sleeping is almost impossible with ques taking plus 10 minutes.also playing from another region (only na and eu servers) has a ping that is competitively innefective, especially with the projectile slowed weapons.eu and na servers are the only one remaining due to low player numbers on the other regions, like south america, africa, asia and australia.even with one que (squads) but not being in a popular hour will make your wait for matches.a game who lost a lot of it's playerbase, 94% from the time it launched in early access still retained a ~3500 active (concomitent) player count daily, now it struggles to maintain half of that. tldr:realm royale for me and for a lot of players was a game really unique, fun, enjoyable, competitive with few issues in gameplay but some in balance. still the developers tried to balance the game at much as they could, still ignoring the comments of the playerbase. was still a decent experience. now, erez (ceo of hi-rez) just said a you to all players and decided to pull out every uniqueness of the game and basically modify the game completely, that only looks similar to what it was before. they tried to bring in more people by borrowing concepts from other games, being more casual and easier to play. they did not achieve nothing, but they managed to drive off their playerbase and attracted no one new, or at least no one to overpass the big ammount of players that left.realm royale is a sad exemple of a game that was technically decent and had a unique style getting destroyed by corporate greed, not listening to your playerbase and feedback and shelling early access as a motivation to bring in the new changes.realm royale is one of the few games that had to change the entire steam page to reflect the new changes, and is one of the few games that changed it's entire identity in the course of the early access period, totalizing 3 months at the time of writing.while not popular it still had a population that could make this game last for at least 4-5 months more and with an actual driving force it could have become one of the better battle royale games. now, it's a graveyard. hopefully, soon, someone will get fired for this disaster and they will pull out the sinking ship. if not, it will go deeper and deeper in the nothingness of time.for what is worth, i am happy for the purchases i made in old realm royale. i received cool items, a semi interesting battle pass that kept me playing and the tought of supporting the developers of realm royale. but i never expected this to happen, even if it is an early access. i would have never put money in what realm royale is now, even if i would have never played the old realm royale.",1

8330,if you're not looking to play hardcore this is a great game. i absolutely love the combat.but when you get to higher levels you realise that you need to spend real cash to enjoy it. i spent a lot of time trying to make premium cash through farming/crafting so that i don't have to spend anything on but that didn't work out very well.i've been playing this on and off for years now. a good game to pass time. the seasonal events are fun and the browser game is cute. just don't get too attached :),1

13283,"if you are a fan of minecraft and all the features that make it good, this game will disappoint you.the major issues with this game are:1) the developers have an ego, they don't actually listen to the community (despite the lies that pr spouts), and are patronizing to the community, while claiming to listen to them.2) there are no option for texture packs, mods, single player, or creative mode (the most demanded features by the community || see ) . none of the features would be hard to do and keep it free either.3) it's very sub-par on the survival side of things. it's generally too easy to get to top tier equipment, and there's not very much equipment to get in the first place. farming is slow and awful. this is where modding would help, but playful treats the topic like it's heresy.4) the exploration is very underwhelming. after about an hour, it becomes a recurring theme of oh, iv'e seen this before. there are no villages, no dungeons, no monuments, no random buildings, limited biome variety, limited mob variety etc.5) it's a bit expensive. oh, but it's free to play according to pr. well technically yes, but like it or not, the game has achieved pay-to-win status. sure, none of the core features are locked behind a pay wall, but literally all additional textures, and the coolest equipment absolutely is locked behind a pay wall. heck, there have been entire updates that had most of the content locked behind a pay wall. want the good stuff? expect to pay $70 for this game.6) it deserves to be repeated, the devs do not care about the community. when they claim to listen, what they mean is that they cherry pick the request they like and implement them, then giving themselves glorious fanfare on blogs and social media to the tune of look how much we listen!",0

10023,the best hunting game hands down!! the only people that complain are those that are broke and looking for anything free to play. if you enjoy hunting then this is a no brainer. this game is not difficult as some n00bs here on steam complain. once you get the hang of things you will be cleaning the forest out. i recommend watching lots of youtube videos to find out more info and how to play the right way. i have been playing this game for over 5 years now and still not tired of it in the least bit! 10/10!!gunningamerz on youtube,1
5189,"overall, i give a 4.5/5 or 9/10it's a 2d platform fighting game. no it's not smash melee or 4. it's actually sorta unique. has lots of mechanics that do not exist in smash. ex: gravity cancelling, edge sliding, edge guarding is diff, weapon system, and chase dodging. most characters are pretty unique in their own stats + signature moves. this game features amazing 2v2 combos, lots of strings, lots of combos per character, lots of combos per weapon. still, it obviously retains the fighting, getting hit out of stage, sd'ing, and di. 5/5you can also play this game offline with friends at your house or something. also, there is a training mode which allows you to set a bot to reset in its original spot or hp (the more damaged they are, the more they are knocked back). thus, you have an excellent way to repeatedly practice combos alone. 5/5you can play from a selection of ffa, 1v1 experimental mode, 1v1 ranked, 2v2 ranked, and custom games.5/5customization: each character can be bought and leveled up. leveling up until 20 on a character unlocks many different color choices for that character. you can purchase skins: they include the outfit + 2 weapon skins. you can mix and match colors + skins of your choice for each character. it's not entirely customizable, but it's good enough.4/5",1

7968,"enjoyable in short bursts for a long time, i stopped playing nw because it was an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic werent all that interested in fixing it. ive returned after more than six months to nw and i gotta say its a pretty fun f2p mmo, taken in small doses. the combat is fast paced and satisfying, plus after a longtime the game is finally optimized and you can properly enjoy it (it should run at 50-60fps on most pcs even in more crowded areas).although its based on the forgotten realms d&d setting, this game is nothing like its tabletop counterpart (or neverwinter nights for that matter). nw is an action mmo through and through, your characters have no alignment to speak of, so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world (except for the fact that some races work better for some classes). the voice acting is decent, the music is pretty good, graphics are acceptable (better than most f2p mmos on the market), just dont go into this game expecting the next big thing.if you are not willing to spend any money on this game, then i would suggest you stay away from pvp. as a non-paying player you wont be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop items that make your life much easier (or those who have played aton). as a side note, you are able to convert astral diamonds (a currency you get from different in-game activities) into zen (the premium currency, that can also be bought with your hard earned $) to buy stuff from the cash shop, but the rates arent all that great.another problem for free players is that we are limited to 2 character slots per account, which is kinda  and the only way to get more is with zen (on the other hand, you can make and use as many free accounts as you like). whats more, 3 races are locked behind game packs that go for 49,99  for the moon elf, 69,99  for the dragonborn and 189,99  for the menzoberranzan renegade (the packs also include some mounts, a char slot each and some otherthats not all that useful).as for pve, its pretty entertaining, albeit repetitive. once you hit max lvl, your main goals are to obtain some artifacts and do the campaigns (which mostly consist of doing daily quests, getting some resources which youll use to research some passive skills for your character). the quests you do arent all that memorable, but at least they arent very long, so you wont have to spend too much time with em. recently theyve also introduced a system that makes the campaigns faster for an alt but i havent spent much time with it so i cant say how much faster they really are.all in all, if you can look past its flaws (which are quite a few), nw is a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly killing monsters and grinding some gear.",1

15695,"at first glance, one might find aq3d to be a pretty basic, not-so-difficult hack and slash mmo. but this game, in my opinion, does so much more than just appeal to longtime artix entertainment fans. honestly, it, in a way, is revolutionary (hear me out). not only is ae tapping into the cross-class playtype (which i haven't seen in almost any games), they're making a game that doesn't just hand you everything you want. the first few levels go by no problem, and you're appropriately geared. however as the game starts to veer towards dungeon-crawling and actual grinding, one finds themselves actually having to work for items. to be properly geared heading into a new zone or just for new dungeon content, you actually have to work. this involves not only fighting zone bosses for items to craft better gear, it also incorperates working through dungeons with other players for the same reasons. if that's not enough, ae is a company that will listen to fan input (amazing, isn't it?). the content creators constantly interact with fans. there's transparency from the staff on upcoming updates and issues they're working to solve. as far as bugs, this game is in beta. those of us playing are here to help sort out the bugs and get the game ready for final release. that being said it is already a pretty complete game with tons of fun content and many planned seasonal events (including one going on at the time of this review being written). i recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun, immersive cross-platform experience.",1

(although you'll probably want to spend some money to keep this game going!!!)- drafting is awesome, you draft 4 packs and keep every card you draft (as well as prizes depending on how you do)- standard meta feels very balanced, nothing feels broken, so many different deck types that are competitive- you can win 1 pack each day for winning a casual or ranked match, as well as new quests every day to earn in-game gold- i usually have more than enough gold to draft anytime i want tocons:- art style is a little cheesy?

11953,"when neowiz invited emissaries to check the game out at their hq they gave them mid level characters to try out and it was stated by arctix, if not one of the other emissaries, that they didn't want to spoil content for players by showcasing level 45 content. these same people have commended neowiz for their transparency and now act as though the community hasn't been mislead. the content was assumed to be there and neowiz purposely left it out of its showcase knowing that it wasn't. you can't commend a company for its openness and excuse them for not stating that content will be missing, to be rolled out at a later date, that they held off from saying such proves their unreliability.further still, the only real change to na version is the combat system which. true action combat is missing (and by that i mean tera or even bns style type targeting), item duping is a known issue on every other region and surprise - it's on na too. you can say this'll be fixed, but the only way to remove such items now would be a wipe, and since that's not happening the economy is already screwed and it's only day 2. there was a 6 page summary on how to do it, so for those saying it's not wide spread, it really is.i'm more disappointed with the communities divisiveness, people attacking others for stating facts, because neutrality only exists in the absence of objectivity to some people.just because this is a early access doesn't excuse all of the flaws the game has when they've had 6-7 years to perfect the game. it's a cash grab of the worst kind, they couldn't even deliver a game to then turn it into p2w after a few months like other korean mmos we've had westernised. i'm not sure what mode of lie i prefer more.if you're shaking your head at all of this, just take a loot at steam handing out refunds to people with 20+ playtime that have redeemed their in game founder items. this game is a flop.",0

4844,"at this point in time i have 799 hours logged. i'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other moba's and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. smite is a 3rd person moba unlike most moba's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of moba and the way i prefer to play a moba.i've only played around 3 matches of lol, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other moba'snow. to get to the basics, you have your guardians,mages,warriors,hunters and assassins, all of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.hunters- hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy tank.mages- all around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.guardians- guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.warriors- warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.assassins- assassins are very crucial to your conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being overpowered, they're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.pro's- visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, top down just isnt my cup of tea.community- all in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other moba's too me.updates-smite is regularly updated with new content very often, in the last year it's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but high-rez stays on top of it.gods-all of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and any of them can be good if they are in the right hands.cons-unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.hunters- hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play neith,ah muzen cab, xblanque and many others, but they need to be nerfed unlike league (going by word of mouth) yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, i'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, they make being a guardian not fun.guardians- there are alot of fun guardians in the game but, as ive said in the previous statement hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.i've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, i like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, you're not playing ranked-conquest. stop acting like it, thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of dota 2, or lol.last thing is the server downtime, i want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, but, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in the last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. i've read many articles stating that it's because of ddos from other developers, i would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. my problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. so high-rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, please, try and fix this problem.thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.i'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me. favorite gods-vulcan,agni,neith,khepri,poseidon.",1

4214,"well, what can i say? i mean look at how many hours i have spent in this game (spoiler alert: a lot) not only that but that isnt even my total playtime since i had the game on android before i had it here so my hours here can easily double at the time of this review hell its even beaten my favorite games in playtime.now with the actual review: if you arent familiar with yugioh at all start here: this game is a great starting point because its simplistic because of its format and lack of complicated mechanics, the game itself has tutorials that work more like quizes that are entirely optional and you actualy get gems(the important in game currency that will allow you to get cards faster) and i know what you are thinking...gems? is this a facebook game or what? and well gems can be purchased with real money so it kind of has a real conection but unlike other games they arent scarse, you basically get over 1000 when you start (at least thats what how i remember it) plus 200+ each month thanks to events wich at the same time give you more cards and more characters so i think you should give it a try because in my opinion its the easiest and cheapest way posible to start playing the game if you are familiar with the android version of the game start here: the rumors where true at least just at first the port had some bugs like the battles not starting right but that got fixed with an update, also the screen was directly ported making the window an akward rectangle almost like it was an android emulator but another recent update(at the time of the review) made the sides even better i admit they already where usefull since they displayed cards info in a bigger font and the duel history was constantly displayed but now they also show the events and stuff and thanks to those upgrades i can say without a doubt that the pc version is the definitive version since the andorid version takes too much space on the phone and has smaller font and in general runs wors than in pc xd. if you just are familiar to the tcg start here: the game is definitely not like the current tcg at all it kind of lives in a bubble where you arent losing your game if you dont fill your board on the second turn, if i had to simplify it i would say it lives in the gx era but with better and recent cards, the basics and the essence is still the same it just that in a smaller portion and without complex summoning mechanics like synchros, xyz, pendulums and links (at least not at the time of this review) if all those special fusions where to be added i am sure they would try their best to keep the game simple, how simple you ask well simple enough that worms and ojamas are viable options (well maybe worms not so much but they do work) now one of the major diferences is character abilities each character has several abilities that can be equiped to a deck and they can go as simple as at the start of the duel using a specific field spell like yami, or more developed like maximillions mind reader ability which lets him see the oponents face down cards as long as he has 2000 lifepoints or more (he as in pegasus) now this may sound like it breakes the game but no, its the oposite it adds depth to it you have to consider abilities when deck building and you get rewarded by being diverse aka using a lot of diferent decks at least two for each duelist abilities also let you compensate for the lack of cards and add fluidity to a deck kind of like master of fusion which allows you to take a polymerization card from outside of the deck when your life drops 1500 instead of doing a normal draw this type of ability allows you to turn things when you have the fusion materials at hands but you cant draw poly or hell have a fusion deck without any poly or with less then 3, posibilities are endless.",1

(to preface this is only from my experience if you want to play give it a try) i understand the fact that battle royales have rng. luck plays a roll in your success, in cuisine royales case though i feel like it's too random. 7 out of 10 games i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope. other games i will spawn in a decent location, and i'll end up looting 6 houses and leaving the area with a c96 pistol with 8 bullets and a pot on my head. the game's dull for the most part due to the fact that for 90% of the ing game you don't engage with anyone and don't even get me started on the gun play. the accuracy of weapons in this game are atrocious largley due to bullet bloom. i do not understand why some developers add bloom as a game mechanic, but it's ; it destroys the majority of skill that goes into aiming your weapons, and it makes fire fights for the majority of the time down to luck. due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapons with the exeptions of the mg 42, and the ppsh and a few others which leads to tough late games when you are lucky enough to have regular engagements in the game. in my opinion it rewards hiding instead of engaging. the weapon damage seems inconsistant as well. some times i will put 15 bullets into someone and they won't drop and i'll end up losing the engagment 0ther times i'll completely rip open the guy in like 3 bullets. i realize that there are most likely hit multipliers, but nobody should need to be hit 15 consecutive times to die. it's glitchy as well i was playing duos with a friends and we were going to win the game, but instead the game decided to clip him into the military fort that he was standing on when he went prone ontop of it ultimitely trapping him and killing him. this game has a lot of potential. i know it's in early access; i will keep playing, and i will re-review this game if the developers fix issues and are proactive in the community looking forward. the accessory mechanic was a very good addition and makes the game unique compared to other battle royales. darkflow studios even though this was an april fools joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular. optimistic for the future.(i still recommended this game since it is fun but it's broken in a lot of aspects. i wanted to address them while giving my take on this game and thoughts for the future).",1

9060,"i just reinstalled and retried planetside 2 for the first time since it came out, and i can say with unwavering certainty that its one of the very worst new player experiences ive ever had with a game. it was mesmerizingly terrible at giving a positive first impression.- despite having just installed what one should reasonably assume was the latest version via steam, the game still required a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup, as well as a third party registration, without the ability to sync with my steam account.- the tutorial is stretched over a needlessly expansive area, and the narrators lines frequently bleed into and play over one another if one moves along ahead of the plodding pace it wants one to. needless to say, this renders any help such lines could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless, leaving one to flail about and learn through trial and error, rather than instruction, instead.- the very first thing i experienced upon connecting to an instant action is getting spawn killed with an airstrike not one second after setting foot on the ground. fan-ing-tastic.- the ui is one of the very worst ive ever encountered in terms of giving mechanical information to new players. i know it shows information on controlled areas, flashpoints, how many friendlies and hostiles are detected in an area, etc, and thats all nice; however, there are some much more practical questions it seems intent on not answering. where can i spawn? how can i change respawn locations? why, when i attempt to decipher the help menu tooltips for the map, and find that i must use warp facilities to change spawn regions, am i greeted with an insta-death restricted area message upon attempting to reach one of those facilities? who knows! im just constantly told to click the instant action tab, and let the game carry me off to wherever it thinks im needed, regardless of whether i want that region or not. - when i attempted to ask other players in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill, i was greeted with the following automated message: the dead cant speak. i actually uttered an are you ing kidding me? aloud in my office at this point.i know planetside 2 is a well-respected game, and im sure, once one is familiar with it, that theres some reason for that. this isnt about that. this isnt a comprehensive review, nor is it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game. this is simply a commentary regarding the initial impression its current version gives to new, uninitiated players. the short version is this: i felt unwelcome, not by the players, not by my squad, not by my faction, but by the game itself, as a newcomer to planetside 2. at every turn, it seemed as though i was getting punished for not knowing things that a proper tutorial should have taught me, for not realizing the answers to questions i didnt realize i even needed to ask. it felt as if it were deliberately obfuscating critical information that it just expected me to know without proper instruction. ill make this as clear as i can: my initial impressions of planetside 2 were so negative that ive no desire to learn the lessons necessary to further understand the game. im sure the answers are there. im just left with such a poor impression of my experience that ive no inclination to pursue them. im leaving the game - again - and this time, im not returning.",0

5874,"being a long time flight simmer i'm really happy about how dcs world brings flight and air combat to our pc screens. great flight sim with a lot of attention to detail. the world is beautifully rendered with lots of, hills, valleys, towns, cities, rivers and thousands of trees all over the landscape. aircraft are beatutifully rendered inside and out, they sound thunderous and the flight physics feel pretty accurate to me. mind you, to my disgust i've never had the chance to fly around like a excited wide eyed lunatic in an f-15 or an a-10 but aircraft feel responsive to a host of factors in the air from cross winds, to the weight of your loadout, temperature, altitude etc. honestly a lot of the time i have a great time just flying around enjoying the sensation of flight. sim does have a pretty steep learning curve and will take some time to learn each aircraft and it's systems. modules can be expensive but its best you chose an aircraft you want to learn and master it as each aircraft functions fundamentaly differnt. i would treat each full price module has it's own simulator. there are cheaper modules available as well that are not as expensive or as detailed that will still give you a pretty awesome flying experience for a fraction of the price. i will definatly say that this is not a casual game. i see lots of reviews from people saying wtf i coudln't even make it off the ground etc. its really recommended you rtfm or seek out some tutorials. i would also recommend some form of hotas setup for the best experience. more content is being added frequently, i'm particulary looking forward to dcs 2.0 going live, which includes las vegas / nellis afb and red flag campaigns, as well as the addition to the release of the f/a-18.lastly, performance wise dcs is pretty cpu intensive. if you have a decent cpu, you will certainly get better performance. though some easy ways to boost performance is to decrease water detail and civillion traffic ( streets are populated with scores of moving vehicles and trains) there are also guides out there for other ways to tweak performance.",1

(zero personality).you don't really need any of the fancy gear, because the game is easy enough. in fact, i got ahead of the game, level-wise, and i wasn't grinding, or anything. i felt like it's too easy. the only real problem i had was with positioning, so that i wouldn't agro adjacent mobs, and be overrun. every time that i died, is because of the lame dodge mechanics. mobs are way too condensed. dodging gets you killed more often than it saves your life, in this game. speaking of the mobs, i found myself asking, why are they all just standing there, watching me kick their buddies butts, and not helping for? are they blind? this severely destroys immersion. most dungeon raids suck, because one player is a lot higher level, and more experienced than the others, and will just rampage through it, and not allow you to fight or work on the puzzles. the quests are too simple, and repetative. i found myself feeling like every new zone i have to go talk to some irrelevant charactor just to be told that this area is overrun with some generic faction who i need to save everyone from. i couldn't help but wonder why nobody seemed to be lifting a finger to help out. instead they send in me, just one guy, and expect me to be the hero, every single time. the factions don't even carry over into new zones. in one zone you're fighting all orcs, and in the next it's skeletons. it honestly feels just a little generic. it all feels setup, and irrelevant in the grand scheme of it all. the individual stories don't even matter. its just a bunch of text you'll get bored with reading, and start asking, just what are the objectives?.it doesnt feel epic in any way. it feels like a bunch of mind numbing tasks to waste some time on for some reward trinket you don't even need, because it's already too easy, your level is a lot higher than it needs to be. and sooo much running back to the same old shop, where they sell the same old boring gear. getting new quests from the same old charactors, who are always standing in the exact same spot, like they have nothing better to do. of course, they don't need to, because they have you. so, they can just stand there letting you sponge up all the glory, while they stare at the backs of their eyelids. all this evil happening, and people asking for help with what is supposed to be an emergency, but you get to it whenever it's convenient.zzz...i can't find any more good reason to continue wasting time on such a lame and boring game.",0

11180,"tl:dr - feels like 80% magic: the gathering, 20% hearthstone. it's a lot of fun. it has the deck building of magic, with the easy ui of hearthstone. a great mix.i tried this game after it was recommended to me by a friend. i instantly got hooked. if you enjoy this genre, it's absolutely worth checking out.it's very easy to learn all the concepts and abilities in the game, but there is enough variety and depth to the cards, that you can make any number of decks, using whatever strategy you want to try.it's also not pay-to-win. the game is very generous with free card packs, and the legendary(highest rarity) cards seem far more common than in other games. i've only been playing for a few days, and i have already opened over 10 legendary cards, and have built a top tier deck.there is a ranked mode where you take your constructed deck and battle other people, as expected.the part that i like a lot, which is unique, is that you can play vs ai and actually earn good rewards. as i was getting the hang of the game, i played in gauntlet mode. it's a free mode(certain other modes require gold, which you earn by playing) where you face off against series of ai decks. you play until you lose, up to a maximum of 7 games, and the more you win, the better your rewards.if you want to up the ante from there, you can take the gold that you earn by playing in the gauntlet, and enter the forge league. in this league, you draft a deck. the game will present you with three card choices, you pick one, then you get a new set of three, rinse and repeat until you have a full deck. you battle vs increasingly difficult ai, like in the gauntlet, but you get 2 losses and the rewards are much better than in the gauntlet.the best part about the forge, as opposed to say, an arena run in hearthstone, is that you get to keep the cards that you draft. i think that's great.go try it.",1

1704,"here is my problem with the recent addition of dota plus: valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like dotabuff plus and a similar program on overwolf, and i believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). this was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. and now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price). there is nothing intrinsically wrong with dota plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. if people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. in fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like dotabuff that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. these programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. that's it. people have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.in other words, valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). scam if i ever heard one. not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, world of tanks for one example.",0

(where they took a heavy hitting slow firing gun and cranked the fire rate up to 11) why doesnt germany have an automatic rifle? the mg-30 exists. the panzershreck stops being useful after 150m. the bazooka on the other hand has near infinite practical effectivness if you look at their respective charts. why would the bazooka be more effective than a panzershreck? the pzs had a larger round. why do the russians start off with a 70 round smg? why does germany start off with a 20 rd smg? 32 rd mags were made available for the mp34 during ww2, but i guess that kind of upgrade only counts if you are american. the avs-36 only had 34,500 (max) rifles produced, why is it in the game? why does russia need another automatic gun when they have smgs that hold 70 rds? why does a dp-27 not puncture armor, but when you put it in a t38 light tank it melts through armor like a .50cal? its a .30 cal round and its not even 30-06. why are all of the planes in this game flying tanks? the firepower that most planes in this game are able to take should rip straight through them like a laser through paper mache.and for the love of god, can we get anti air guns that counter planes?! that thing that they were designed to do?!?!all of this doesnt even mention the bugs this game has, like how barbed wire can juggle you so you cant move, how your parachute wont open for no reason, para planes randomly crashing into the ground. the bodies that randomly fall out of the sky. 2 ton cars flipping upside down from going over train tracks slowly. at this point having sunk several hundred hours into this game, i know it as the bad game and for some reason keep playing only to make more money and buy more stuff. that part is fun, playing for the most part, is not and the game will give you more money to ride a bike in a field, than to play because of upkeep. dont buy gold, the devs dont deserve the money until they fix their mess.",0

3081,"tl:dr; great game being tarnished by bad development practices (fpe/parts debacle as of late is a good example of it)to start, this game is fantastic. currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat, and ships/helicopters entering closed beta testing. no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone (arcade for 'casuals' and realistic battles for more 'hardcore' players)engine is utterly fantastic for any game, moreso a f2p game. absolutely amazing performance on any system, can almost run on your microwave, while having great graphics on the highest settings. only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the config file but it's pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally isn't neccesary. i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is, in my opinion, one of the best f2p games on the market. but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others, even if i continue to play the game.why? because gaijinthey have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up, and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them. outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle, such as the ru-251. they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with ge purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it. special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection (fp), which parts are needed to repair your tank after it's damaged (which happens alot) and fp is needed to put out fires. these parts can each take 50-100 battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock.for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome. a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for gameplay and grinding were mentioned, and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind. this video then, unsurprisingly, received ~5k downvotes versus ~1k upvotes. comment section filled with people calling out gaijin and saying parts/fp should be free and not ground out for.then anywhere it removing the grind for parts/fp on a gaijin operated platform the discussion is censored. this parts/fp isn't the first nor last time gaijin perform a practice like this. i can not recommend people who haven't played this game to do so, you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into gameplay hampered by greedy practicesif gaijin ever turn this around, starting by somehow reducing/removing the parts/fp grind then i will change the reccomendation to a yes",0

9565,"changed my mind this game sucks, thumbs down now. you can still read the review if you want.alright so it looks like that i'm the only one here now with an insane amount of hours that still actually thinks this is a good game, not entirely ruined by the company. this is a game where if you play a lot you're going to be good. if you play a lot you're going to get good gear. it's not as if the company kabam being greedy is taking the core away from the game, just because kabam is a greedy company it shouldnt take away from the fact that you can still enjoy the game without paying a lot of money.if you come into a f2p game and expect to not spend any money then you were mistaken to even set foot in it in the first place because you all know as well as i do what the f2p business model is.there are a lot of things that which you must buy to fully enjoy the game for what it is, but like i said that should be expected for most f2p games today. you may need vault chests, which is 500 gold each which equals 5usd. you may need a character slot, which the first few are cheap but the rest cost about 1000 gold, which equals 10usd. but you do not need to buy all of these seperartely, they do frequently release good packs that allow you to actually save on some money if you wait for one of them, for example the play more pack can have 1 character slot 1 vault and 2 backpacks, which is a 2000 gold value for only 1000 gold.so if you decide you want to play this game then give it a shot but do not expect to not pay anything if you plan on playing it a lot.now i will say that even i am not the happiest with kabam, they're very sloppy, greedy, and slow with content. but that does not make this a bad game. i repeat for the 50th time that does not make this a bad game. i just makes a game that is ran by a bad company. everyone here downvoting this game because of the company is just wrong because you cant judge the game itself like that, you're taking away from other people who may geniuenly enjoy this game for what it is, because you gave it a bad review when it doesnt deserve it. i am by no means a kabam fanboy. but i am a rotmg fan, and if you're looking to play this game then i do reccommend it.",0

10734,"you like games like magic the gathering and hex, and are happy with their format and close resemblance to their gameplay, this is your game. for there are no suprises here and no real innovation. so if you want to play with new cards, go for it.but first...1)first you have to get through long and boring tutorial.2) then through long and boring ai deck gauntlet. at lowest level, they only play 1-2 relevant spells per game.finally you can play some other formats, including ranked and draft.about draft - instead of drafting against human opponents, you are drafting vs ai (but you play vs humans), what really kills that format. yeah sure, it saves waiting time, but it makes the format pointless.even i managed to go 7-1 in my first draft, i was upgraded to silver rank (and then gold) soon and then it became really hard.by that time, i still found that the game was kind of fun, and decided to buy the founder pack, to get the campaign cards quickly. 5 days later i completely regret the desision. this game is not for me. i do not like magic anymore, i played magic the gathering (father of that type of card games) for 15 years and i have been off magic for another 10. with all the possibilities, why dont you have creativity to improve on the format, not just offering the same game.and yeah, i dont like merhcant cards in constructed (units that access your sideboard during the game). i dont like the mana screws. i dont like the sites mechanic (pwoerful castle that casts free spell each turn, ending with powerful champion). nothing about this game's gameplay is, that i can really recommend. and ui. it is really hard to figure out how to use ui for some of the more complicated targeting spells. prepare to get several losses before you figure that all out.",0

5781,"a few of my friends have been playing this for a while, and i've been dying to get it. i recently built a decent computer and decided to take the plunge into throwing hours of my life at the screen. i bought the f-15 module just to try it out, and although disappointed the f-16 has not been modeled (yet), the eagle is a stellar combat platform. coming from a background in civil aviation and being type rated on cessna 172xp, i can vouch for how realistic the flight model feels. it really (to the extent that my controls can convey) feels like you are being buffeted by wind at low speeds, you can feel the aircraft as is starts to lose lift, and after a few hours you start being able to read the aircraft, when it is about to stall, the best roll to turn, aoa for climbing at the edge, you become one with the aircraft. switching from one plane to another really throws your head for a loop. they've really got the effect of feeling what the aircraft is doing damn near perfect. i don't think even fsx models ground effect as realistically (read: scary as f***) as this game does. it truly is a simulation. pull the stick back and cut the throttle, as the aircraft starts to shake and the wing starts to dip, adrenaline kicks in. it is unreal. i've never gotten such a physical response from a game before. the weight of the weapon and fuel payload is completely dynamic. i found myself flying touch-and-go landings for hours, working towards getting my glide slope and flare *just* right, only to restart and realize my pitch angles and approach speeds had to be entirely different from when i ended the last time, due to being fully loaded again. this is not a game you can pick up and start dominating in within a few minutes. you need to dedicate hours upon hours learning the airframe you want to excel in, and stick to it. it will frustrate you, it will make you never want to hold a flight stick again, but once you get your first kill, or the first time you successfully take on fuel from a flying tanker, the amount of excitement you feel is incredible. getting sweaty palms from holding the aircraft perfectly in formation so as to not get a fuel boom in your turbine is great. getting a radar contact at 80 miles, and have to watch his blip get closer and closer, until finally entering the weapon effective range had me on the edge of my seat. i find myself running through my last sortie in my head while i'm at work, thinking of what i could have done differently, better tactics to use, strategies to try. it is amazingly addicting. i've logged 14 hours over the last few days, and i see myself putting in quite a few more late nights, flying hundreds of sorties. i haven't even delved into the online world yet. i am hesitant simply because i know there are thousands of people online who would make me look like i've never even flown a paper airplane before, and i don't want to make a fool of myself. yet. :)i think the only downside to this simulator is quite simply how steep the learning curve is. i'm sure there will be quite a few people who can't take off, get angry and say this game is broken. take it slow, do the lessons, and most importantly, read the manual! yeah, most of them are close to 200 pages, but like i said earlier, your first kill will make that completely worth it.i would highly suggest that if you are an aviation fanatic, like a challenge, and want to get as close as you can to pushing the throttles to the forward stop in a variety of combat aircraft without joining the military, get this game. i can only sit back and wonder how they are going to improve dcs:w in their second iteration, because from my perspective, the mechanics of it are spot on.",1

8970,"after having played +300 hours i can say that this is most likely the best f2p shooter ever created so far. the easiest comparison is with battlefield. it's pretty much battlefield in a sci-fi setting and huuuge! each of the current four continents spans 64 square kilometers with many bases and outposts ranging from small forward outposts to large tech plants. combine this with a unique look to each continent plus three factions longing for control over the territory, most of the time having two or more fronts to battle at, and very good game balancing and you get planetside 2.the only real downside to the game are the required system specs. the game is pretty performance-hungry, but the devs are working in improving the games performance constantly.if you're not a lone wolf type of player you might want to grab some friends or find an outfit to roll with tho, because there's only so much you can do by yourself. sometimes a coordinated air raid or tank convoy is the thing you need and you can't do this as effectively when you're alone.",1

(and he's super self-conscious)i would love to tell you the story of all my failures, but nobody is gonna wanna read that scidoodle.so, here's a summary: you got good internet? play. if not? please, find a garbage can, proceed to stab yourself (not too much, just enough to bleed out in a good few minutes) and throw yourself in the trash.just think of all the good you'd be doing, for example:i would've gotten to experience the game to it's fullest extent with friends.along with all those other people you scared away because of your internet's absurd temper.q/a:q: i'm a veteran player with 500+ hrs and never experienced this problem.a: i envy you, you little sh- next question!q: was it possible that it was your side?a: if it was me, i'd stop playing and find something better to do.

(i can run the game at ultra)q: who's that guy?a: you're joking right? we just went over this.q: you've only got an hour and a half into the game, why judge it so harshly?a: game's good, but you might want to have a couple friends. (people i met were awful)q: why do you recommend the game despite you not liking it?a: let's get real, this game is good. if you had not played it yet i suggest you try it when you have the chance. i may not play it for a while, (a long while) but when i get time i'll definitely come back for more when i've got some friends gathered.q: what would you rate this ?/10?a: 7/10 (opinion may vary through further gameplay)please, if you are reading this and have yet to play this game.get some friends. your first impression will be way better that way.and tell joel to stop downloading his... female chests.

15277,"the game is terribly unfair and really picks its favorites. it always selects someone to be the lucky winner and another person to be the terribly sorry loser. i had played quite a few matches with friends and most of the time i was selected to be the loser (by the game, that is). no need to say i didn't enjoy that. it's not like i'm paranoid for thinking that - like my friends who were winning thought - it's totally the oposite, because when it was my friends' turn to be the loser, they started noticing a pattern too: some people simply have lucky rolls in this game for no reason and the same goes the other way. you don't roll physical 3d rendered dice, instead, you click a button and wait for the game to do its thing. i can't say i trust that. the rolls were so predictable, me and my friends started guessing the next rolls and we would mostly be right about it.its pretty much random how it selects people, i was just unfortunate enough to be selected several times. its rgn system is completely broken and who knows if that really was what the developers had in mind. if it was, i can say it was a terrible decision. it makes no sense to be like this. it's not fun as soon as you know you will lose. who'd want to play like that? (the developers, maybe)rgn aside, this game has some other flaws, such as the trouble that we must go through if we wanna play with friends. sometimes the steam chat invite doesn't work, some other times it does. some people can host rooms, some others can't (and like the winner/loser pick i just mentioned, it also changes between players). you are always designated one of the 4 random colors (red, blue, green and yellow) at the beggining of each game and can't pick your own color (but can pick between 4 different characters), which at first might not seem so bad, but when your game doesn't have a quick replay option in case you want to play again with the same settings, it gets mildly annoying to say the least. you'd have to leave the match you just finished just so you could create another one from scratch and invite your friends again. when that happens, you'll be assigned random colors again, which really messes up your brain when you want to identify your friends, based on the last match.this game is not very user friendly, but made me and some friends kill some time, but i still can't recommend. if you wanna get a good board game video game, get tabletop simulator. that's the definitive game in this category. go there and play some monopoly, whatever. it's not such a good game anyway...",0

16737,"access reviewthe graphics is incredible, even on with all settings on low. day looks like day, the sun reflects off slippery surfaces beautifully, trees and landscrape is nicely done, and the river stream makes me want to take a dip.gameplay is strange. i'm getting killed from insane distances that when i try the same thing it seems like my guns have limited range, but certain other players' don't. can't even readily tell when i make a kill - put player specific kill messages top center, it's much easier to see. next, i can get killed by a melee attack with a ing blunt force weapon and die instantly even with full armor, yet my weapons seem to have no effect up close - and no i'm not a lousy shot. i'm coming from games like doom, gears of war and the unreal tournament franchise. and why is there not a full list of players in server? frames, but no ping readout?the lobby screen - why not show a list of gaming sessions players can join instead of having them wait on the slow poke search? like multiplayer games traditionally do? i've waited up to 10 minutes to join - not nice in a game with no respawn and where if you die you must reconnect to the server.lastly, battle royale is a lame and annoying genre. i don't know why every damn game studio is getting on that bandwagon since pubg released. it's not ground breaking and it gets old fast. it seems like the gaming industry is going the way of china, bootleg after bootleg knock off after knock off. the games all seem the same - you jump out of some plane parachute style (cuisine royale is an exception) and do nothing but run around collecting inventory items and guns (that you sometimes can't find in this game, so you die - kinda unfair so you end up bringing a knife to a gun fight but whatever), all while some ominous fog is trying to kill you or get shot outta no where. it's literally death match with the exception being the players invests more time doing stupid shiate and playing hide and seek while grinding for the most kills. it's more depressing than fun. i can't recommend this or any other br games to be honest, paid or free.",0

11245,"6 / 10 = concept, gameplay, design are wins, but end result is a 'fail' for me in general ... it's a good game, easy to learn and play, the diversity is pretty extensive, good selection of elements as basis with added neutral cards allows a good selection for decks and then the possibility to 'multi-class' between elements brings in the real complexity of such games. most of all is the simplicity with some beautifull deco and cards effect.unfortunately, this said .. there's the cons side ... let's start with details .. description of effect and such .. you cant put much on cards so i do like the overlay for detailed info ... but there a lack of precision in those said details, all you can read is always the same generic message ... they need to look into others games to really understand this part.for last what reaally sinks them is the sigils concept. they control the level and power of the cards but also link to turns. unfortunately the fact that it's not garanty that you'll find since you need to draw them as you would other cards. soo you have 50 cards in your deck then you add 25 sigils makes it 75 cards ... 1 third of those cards are sigils ... the outcome is the side i hate from this game ... you can either get min/max amount of sigils . if you get a min amount its game over since you cant afford higher cards, in opposite if you get too many on a constant basis.. your level does go up but you have nothing to play or defend with, this leaves you with the 'fair' amount throughout the game ... which is either win or loses ... but after how many failed turn due to unbalance sigils distribution ...",0

13636,"for the 6 hours i played, non-stop mind you, i have to give this game a lot of credit. a friend bought this for me after telling me about it and i was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to minecraft. but, there is a lot of differnces between the two games.the structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing minecraft. it's not as easy as chop some wood, mine some stone, then you're good to go. there is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone. while it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need, you need a lot of them. even after you collect them, you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different matterial. (for example, breaking vines down into twine.) yes, you have wait times on crafting stuff. while it isn't too terribly bad, the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as obsidian, iron, and diamonds. but in my opinion, it adds more to the game because now you have to wait 5 minutes to advance and in that time, you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking.the creatures in the game is definitely unique. while some do remind me of creatures from jak and daxter (the night pigsy's and night leafi's), they still have a unique vibe to them. and they of course vary in difficulty. while a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage, there isn't a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance.also, there is furniture. and to be honest, it actually looks pretty nice. there is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends. you have different types of carpet, walls, and even slanted roof planks you can craft. you even have different colored lamps. you could use them like my friend does and make each room different colors. though the blue sometimes confuses me because i never know if it is dark out or not. but it still looks really nice. much like a room with a bunch of black lights.to add on to the crafting idea to the game, you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game. you have to work your way up and find the recipes. while some of them are scattered in chests around the world, you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else. like weapons for instance. after you craft a wood sword, you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword. which means you have to work to find better things, meaning you actually have a goal to work towards.while there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access, it still runs fairly smooth and it's easy to play with friends. no port forwarding or setting up custom servers. simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up. even when you are offline, they can still join the world and continue which to me, is pretty awesome. i would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes minecraft or sandbox games in general. and i think if you actually take some time with this game, you'll find there is a lot of possibilites with it.",1

8939,"this game is one that actually stands out. this is not a game you can jump in and instantly domminate everyone. it takes time to unlock upgrades and learn how to play. i've played this game since the first year of it being out with soe and then to daybreak games. i've seen it have days of glory and have days of sorrow. it's a massive game that takes a player into 1 of 5 landscapes and thows them in a world of air, tank, and infantry play. it's a battlefield on a grand scale. hundreds of players all at once. each doing what they want and what they can to help their faction. outfits are a bunches of players that can act as one or just goof around. squads to join to play with friends or to work on team work. a fast scale of customization all for free. a fast spectrum of players that range from hard veteran players to just brand new players that are just trying to find a new game that they like. a lot of people complain about certain aspects of the game but they forget that they get everything for free. they can spend money to unlock different weapons and armor but they don't have to. it's a game, that as i said before, takes time. you cannot go in and play for only an hour and get the full experence of the game. it's a great game that has survived for over 5 years and i still love it and can't wait to see what daybreak does for it.",1

7207,"i played legends via the bethesda launcher, when it was first released (before it was on steam). i'm not sure why i stopped, but i later decided to get it on steam. i recently thought about playing it again, so i spent some time with it last night. i really enjoyed it, even more than hearthstone, because it has a deeper single player mode to it. in fact, there's single player story mode and the solo arena.i was surprised, when i opened it up with steam, that i was continuing from the progress i made from first playing it via the bethesda launcher. so, i didn't have to restart at the beginning. i learned a bit more about the game. in most battles there are two lanes for cards, sometimes there is only one. sometimes they contain bonuses, for instance the right may give cards cover, so they cant be attacked until theyre exposed. sometimes the left lane may give cards a bonus, too. its interesting.i usually won (in single player mode), but when i lost, i'd switch decks (from what i obtained) and win. i've now finished the first story and i believe i've unlocked all the modes. now i need to earn more gold or spend real money to unlock more.to complete some dailies, i had to fight real players. i lost each time, but some of the games were close. i didn't feel bad about losing, because my daily goal was just to play in versus mode. so, that was an easy one to achieve. in contrast, hearthstone often has dailies that include victories, certainly not a daily i enjoy.this game is apparently on multiple platforms, making it much more accessible. i think its fun and being based on tes makes it even better. its another free ccg and i think its worth playing.",1

(not something that i find fascinating, but its a nice feature)-you can customize your character.cons:-the game has some bugs. the ladder is so annoying, you won't fit on it properly, you have to struggle, it feels like the character is to big to fit into a 1 block gap with the ladder. sometimes when you close doors or traps, you get pushed into the air and fall to death. you can farm some resources with ease (diamonds and coals), by using glitches. sometimes when you use a potion or food to regen, it won't activate. (those bugs are rare, not something that will annoy you, beside the ladder, that is so annoying, but they need to be fixed).-the game doesn't have weather (rain, snow, thunderstorms... ect.), instead it has a temperture that it shows up whenever you are in a specific zone (savannah is really hot and you can burn to death or in the mountains you can freeze to death if you don't have a fire nearby). the temperature is a really nice feature, but combined with weather or seasons, that would have been so much better and insane!!! -the tree leaves won't decay. they just stay in the air after you take a tree down.-fps problems in the multiplayer. rare small rollbacks (not something that will be a problem). need to be better optimised. not a big problem, not something that will occur everytime.-the game need to have more monster models, more adventures. portals to other worlds. bosses need to be added. more content would really make the game better.-the game does not have a hunger feature in it. you can't starve. you can craft food however and use it to regen your health.-wanted to see some zombies in it. wanted to see some random villages with npcs that can sell stuff like it minecraft. adding humanoids would have been nice.-wanted to see more blocks and decorations.my conclusion:the game is really nice to play with friends and to have that minecraft vibe in a f2p game. the game have nice graphics and new mechanics and ideas that you can't see in minecraft, but it also lacks several cool features from minecraft. the game could really become incredible if more content were to be added into the game. beside the issues that it has and the lack of some features, it's stil a very good game, one that i enjoyed so far and will play it more. i recommend it! i also hope the game will be active and the devs will improve it over the next months and years.",1

14455,"product received for freeearly access reviewtl;dr: another veteran gets rambles on about the good ol' days of robocraft, and won't be returning even if they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.i have another ~200 or so hours on their launcher, as well as the 410 hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in early access. meaning, i've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.thing is, i can remember a time when i first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. however, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. this was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. just simple tdm all day every day.then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. so much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. spiderbots. spiderbots everywhere. sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but i remember more spiders than them.this was about the time i left for a few months, and came back to find megabots. oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. the megabots before the epic up with fj were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. the art bots i very much enjoyed were very squishy. the reason why was very simple: each block had different hp, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to nil if blown up. another way to drop the fps was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. the more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.that was a fun time, and i really do miss those days. what with grinding for tp (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. then grind for rp just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. that's right folks, i said tier, and there were 10 of them, 11 with megabots.each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. there was no wait ten seconds to be instantly healed, only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. sure. there were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the mega and not your sorrythen came the pit, which was okay, i guess. never really got into it, and still don't. would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. however, they had their own set of problems. such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. there was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. i'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.afterwards came challenge battle, but i'm pretty sure its referred to as battle arena. again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. this also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. where one team with superior firepower would farm the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. they wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around reddit with this.really, though, this was a fun time to play robocraft, until the majour up everyone knows about. such as the removal of tiers (big mistake, fj), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called battle ranking. went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. then again, i stuck around just to see what else they did.what did they bring? why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of megabots. i love megas, and had two; one smg and one plasma. i miss them both, but fj doesn't want them, and if they say no, there's not a damn we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.folks, the thing is, i'm not going to recommend this game to anyone. if you want to try it out, go right on ahead. the game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying cs;go and other first person shooters with their loot crates. not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on reddit after all thispopped into existence. if they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. they've ed up real big this time.ps: at the time of this review, i've about three months of premium left on my account.",0

6506,"dont play this game, seriously.the game has a great idea. path progression, faction based fighting. awesome ideas, perfect... until you actually play the game.horrible hit detection, ballistics like shooting tenis balls, and at least one hacker per match. also snipers, snipers everywhere, and why not? the game rewards you to be a sniper, the longer range a kill the higher the exp. with an average weapon you get 5 maybe 6 exp for a kill, 10 if savior (meaning you stoped them from killing a buddy) 60 if defensive (meaning inside a cap point). average sniper kill at 200m? 75-80 not adding defensive or savior. so you can imagine everymatch has at least half the teams made of snipers.also very pay to win, the bought mgs and sub mgs can almost snipe themselves and the basic rifle has to be almost point blank to hit, that is of course the hit detection lets you.laggy as all hell, ping is a very big problem, buggy, just overall a poorly done gamecould be an awesome game if done right... but its not, and sadly this games ideas are almost exactly what i think an awesome ww2 shooter would be, but i end up raging 90% of the timeif you want to try it and at least pretend like you found the ww2 shooter your looking for, go for it, but for god sakes dont give them any money!",0

7541,"one of the most engaging mmorpg experiences out there. you never run out of things to do, but you don't feel burdened and guilty for not being productive because everything you do is productive. you can just go around mindlessly killing andand pillaging while enjoying some music for some hours and bang, you have made a lot of useful stuff to use later on. zero research, zero preparation, just go out there and kill stuff.some positive points about the game:- the game's depth varies with your mood and it remains fun. you can play light and casual, you can work the market, you can go hard and achieve great stuff...you can play it any way and still have fun.- graphics are pleasing, unless you really hate voxel stuff.- sound effects and ambience have a nice retro feeling.- market system is pretty straightforward, simple to use and efficient. not a lot of depth though.- you don't need to be anywhere, you can do everything you need without having to visit npc's.- classes are very unique and fun to play.- leveling is smooth.- you can have all classes without spending a single penny, you can switch classes as you please and the class is like a whole different character, with other equipment, and you level each class separately. same as having several characters, but without having to log off to switch between them.- you can be very stylish. the appearance of every equipment you loot is added to your collection, and then you can make your equipment look however you like.- you can build your place (pretty much like minecraft) within a predefined space called a cornerstone. you can spawn your home in any cornerstone you find here and there. why is this useful? intead of having to visit npc's, you build your own workshops and portals in your place and use them. plus, you get to show your friends your unique home! - it's fun to move around. you can glide, you can ride, your can skate on rails, you can sail, you can fly around sitting on a ing majestic rocket flying golden throne!- userbase has low toxicity (for an mmo).- game is light, highly optimized, runs great, looks good.- good servers, low latency and downtime.- high fantasy setting with a comic twist.- many quests to do. none of them feels grindy and they're really useful and rewarding.- the game is grindy in a way that it's doesn't make it feel so grindy. and you can always do some other stuff and have fun.- fantastic and very rewarding crafting system which is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp without being watered down or boring.- fun events.- responsive staff.- few bugs.- no need to partner up. just go out there. the game has a unique and seamless party system that rewards nearby players with exp and loot every time someone is killing, looting or completing a quest, and it will include a limited number among the nearest players. so just go out there, find people and smash stuff together without worrying or even knowing them, the games encourages that.- you can actually convince your normie and casual friends / family and actually enjoy it together, 'cause they won't have to understand much about the game to enjoy it. it can be fun in a superficial way, and is still fun when you get more into it and dive deep into it's systems.on the other hand, there are some negative aspects:- pvp is fun, but it's very far from being the center of attention. there are no open pvp areas in the wilds, there are no turf wars or factions, there are no big battles, there's not much reward in pvp in general. people very into pvp will probably hate it.- everything is too damn colorful. it's a matter of taste, really.- too many notifications.- lacks a minimap.- character building has little depth to it.- not much strategy involved, the game doesn't encourage you to join a clan, organize and make a plan to get things done, like killing a boss.- bgm could use some more tracks. it's always the same track for the same kind of place.- multiple jumping makes most dungeon designs totally pointless. they should at least remove that when you enter a dungeon, it feels like you're cheating and the feeling of accomplishment is overshadowed by the fact that you're basically jumping around mindlessly and ignoring mobs 99% of the time until you get to the dungeon's last chamber.- sometimes the camera acts like a when you're near walls, if you're in a small room or a narrow passage.- battlefield is a mess. sometimes too many mobs on one place, too many skills and explosions, always too many colors...very often you can't see- i feel that potions aren't the ideal approach to this game in particular. not sure what it could be though. maybe a new potion system, with craftable potions, recipes to collect, levels and different effects.- dungeons very often are generated in a odd way and you loose too much time trying to find the entrance.- classes are not balanced at all, for both pvp and pve. some will always stand out, while others are pretty much useless and not so fun to play.- they should add a proper dashing system so that you could move around more freely.- not a single class can fight while mounted, even the summoners and tamers. like wtf.",1

3107,"war thunder is a game that allows you to command planes, tanks (or other ground vehicles like trucks), and eventually naval vessels in pvp and pve matches.the selection of vehicles you have range from pre ww2 (usually around the time of the spanish civil war) all the way up to the korean war, and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the usa, germany, ussr, britain, and japan (at the moment japan only has aircraft, but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too). there could possibly be more nations added in the future, but not much info has been provided on that. additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations.the game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches, these are arcade, realistic, and simulator. arcade battles are the most popular, enemy nametags appear when in your line of sight, mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better, for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a colored marker appears when you're aiming at an enemy, with the three different colors (green/yellow/red) indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate. realistic battles has realistic mobility characteristics (though not at the same level of simulator mode), limited markers (nametags still appear, but the lead circle and the colored marker are gone), and realistic team matchups (you won't see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode). simulator mode does what realism mode does, but takes it up to eleven. you can only view your plane from inside the cockpit (some of the cockpit interiors aren't out yet, but you still get some kind of first-person view nonetheless) and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret (like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield).the pvp portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match.aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets (generally the role of attackers/bombers) and destroy enemy planes (generally the role of fighters/interceptors/etc) in the common ground strike mode. there are also the game modes domination (which involves landing on air fields to capture them) and air domination (where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone) the more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives, like the attacking side is helping an ai ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them.tank variety in objective types isn't much better, which are usually just capture and hold points on the map. this is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavy/medium/light tanks, spaa, armored trucks... regular trucks with mounted machine guns ussr plz . the realistic modes objectives don't change much for ground forces, but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time.the pve portion of the game can be done solo or with friends, at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content. the pve content includes single missions where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective, dynamic campaign where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map, and historical battles which you have to buy with the steam pack or in-game, which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cutscenes added. though there doesn't seem to be much of a point to doing these pve activities because they don't provide much of a reward, which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game, the grind.this game is very grind heavy, especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription. if you really want to try out the jets you're going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game.but i can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play. all of the vehicles are very well designed, while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practicing and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle you're facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight.the game isn't p2w either (well, i guess that depends on what your definition of p2w is), most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics, or speeding up game progression. the only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew, which improves the performance of your vehicle, but if you're willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew.while this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games (in my opinion) it isn't the absolute best. if you want that go for dcs world.if you decide to play this i would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there. don't try to rush to the end game because it isn't that great. if you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with, and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments. just try to have fun in the end.this

1022,"i really liked the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ships so overall a fantastic space shooter that i've been looking for, however two things i found lacking on a first impression and limited play. first off in general i felt it was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. and second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability. of course i only played about an hour, so i may be missing some of what the game has to offer, this is just first impressions.",1

251,"*note* pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indiedb and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). now for the review.i'm not really a person who could judge what is considered cute. i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you. so in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indiedb version i played). but outside of those enemies, the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it's your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there's no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. what i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the rules to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what's in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie a) you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and b) that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.that's not to say that how the enemies appear in sphj is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don't know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it's own eeriness as you don't know what the next room holds for you. you have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.however this brings up an issue i have with the game, there's way too much luck involved. i'll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first catwalk room (that's what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). if you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.there are other points like this as there's an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i've yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven't encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you're going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i'm not sure if it's an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it's just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can't just hold down the w key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. no, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won't move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. like i said i'm not sure if it's intentional or not, if it's not then i hope the devs will work on this as it's basically a cheap beginner's trap. but other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can't wait to see what the full release is like.",1

(one person has more than one account. the bots move together in formation, and perform macro actions).5: matchmaking pitting experienced against inexperienced bots. obvious mismatches by cpu. i'm experienced and don't enjoy slaughtering obviously mismatched opponents.frankly, this is some of the most flagrant and worst cheating i've seen. even the legitimate purchasing of other robot builds eliminates much of the uniqueness and encourages cheats.that being said, when you get into a game with little cheating (won't say no cheating because it's so rare), the game is fun. even the bad matchmaking is tolerable periodically.",0

6965,"easily my favorite card game. there are a lot of little things that i really enjoy about it, but there are two big factors for me. legends has two lanes, that (with rare exceptions) do not interact with each other. one if the field lane, which is exactly like hearthstone's board. the other is the shadow lane, which is the same with the exception that all minions summoned here gain stealth (they can't be attacked) for one turn. the shadow lane mechanic effectively makes board control non-binary, which makes games dramatically more interesting. then there are prophecies and runes. you have 30 health, and at each interval of 5 beneath that you have a rune (25/20/15/10/5). when you reach that health value, the rune triggers and you draw a card. this is a nice catch up mechanic in and of itself, but then there are cards with the ability prophecy. these cards are able to be played for free, immediately when you draw them off of a rune. prophecies at seemed like awful rng, but they've grown on me quite a lot. they add a lot of depth and decision making processes that otherwise wouldn't be there, and the rng they add overall is still quite a lot less than land in mtg or just good old fashion randomness in hearthstone.these two mechanics together make games feel a lot more unique and gives me a lot more to think about compared to hearthstone, but still has the same basic gameplay pattern and ease of play that made me love hearthstone all those years ago.",1

6309,"product received for freeearly access reviewthis game, has potential. this can be a fun game. and i hope, that this game is fun when it is finished. but, the beta lacks balance. in the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. that is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. some may say,oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon. i would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. the first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. to hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then. i haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. most of the maps, i've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. only five to be exact. however, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective. the lack of progress is irratating. because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. after about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. you then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. plus, the first american smg is significantly better than the german counterpart because of its lack of recoil. after almost twelve hours pf gameplay, i still can't afford the smg, i'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and i'm frankly at wits end. i will say that at first it was fun, but now i find myself getting annoyed. i am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like i haven't made any progress. i think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. if you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. but their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.",0

6194,"spent more then 1000 hours in this game, but to be honest i cannot recommend it right now. started playing it like 2 years ago and even back then there were some unfavorable factors in it, but still i enjoyed it really much. because it's a free game after all (do not agree it is pay to win, but the grind have become really annoying over the time), it's ww2 shooter that reminded me of good old battlefield 1942. i think i gave enough time the developers to show me they are trying to improve the game... but most of patches did nothing more then adding fancy, but useless, stuff. ingame maps are big, but people cant find each other and there is no intense action, but camping with snipers in bushes and tanks pixelshooting you from other corner of the map. paradrops and jeep raids are best way of taking flags like in arcade style.but one more thing about the grind. i played with like 300 hours with main footmen and till now i've reached only level 15 (out of 22)... just imagined i have to play till i retire from work to reach cap and instantly got frustrated. still, not to present biased opinion here are the good things in game: many vehicles, weapons and mods for them; good and fresh update to bf42 ww2 experience; some tactical and strategic skills necessity for playing.don't want to discourage you, if you are new to the game - give it a try, but keep in mind that community is dying and development got stuck and do not expect much from h&g in the future.",0

1370,this game is very much like mobas where it pits 5 players against 5 other players in an arena sort of combat. but instead of having to buy heroes or something you instead get to research toward space ships in a fashion similar to world of tanks or similar games. when players leave there is a sort of balance system in place to where it is still possible to have victory over a larger team. what ship type you pick and what you're up against is not entirely what decides the game. it is how well you play that ship,1
4814,"this was once one of, if not, my favorite games. the base concept of the game is amazing. it is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. the problem lies within the developer, hirez (or titanforge whatever they are called now).if i had to give this game a rating on just the base game and how fun it is, i'd give it a 8.5/10yes, i still play very frequently. but it's only ever with my friends and never alone. i have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but i don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. i've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. i've simply learned too many things and played so much that i would say that i am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.the matchmaking is just a joke. honestly. i don't need to say more than that. matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get yourpushed in.there are very frequent patches, one or two a month. a new god is also released everyone 1.5-2ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. the problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for litearlly years. yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since 2014 and was fixed only recently. 4 years! and even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in 30 seconds or something like that.the skins in this game are amazing to be fair. they look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. there's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get 1 or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire year.again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. certain gamemodes like siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. the game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.it's also frustrating that this year hirez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on mixer instead of twitch. this is when i realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on mixer than there would be on twitch. not to mention that the smite world championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to smite through twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.i think i have put more time into this game than any other game i have ever played. i love this game, but i cannot stress how terrible it feels to play it. i enjoy it far less and sometimes i'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. i feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. i have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest. the problem is that i am in the majority.overall, i just couldn't reccommend this game to anyone in the current state that it is in. i have 2k+ hours on steam alone but i played before it was even on steam. i love this game so much, but hirez is not a good company for smite. they don't know what they are doing.thanks for reading my rant lmao",0

6676,"pay to win [written @ 33 ingame hours]changed from negative to positive because i really like this game. it really reminds me of the good old wolfenstein et days. a wwii shooter that doesn't take itself to seriously. sadly this game is pay2win but it's not horrific. you can earn almost everything with just playing but you will need to sink in hundreds of hours and you will lose lots of 1v1's just because the other dude has a better gun in the meantime. what makes a gun better? more damage and more bullets in the magazine for me but that depends on who you ask. at around 50 hours of play i can unlock the same so than we're even with that. but theres tanks, planes etc. you will be a huge disadvantage for a long time. plus you can't buy the 2nd passive without spending irl money. but it also comes with some positives.over time your weapons will get damaged and you'll need to repair them. it's not super expensive, but grenades are very expensive. if you spam them you can easily make a negative income. imo this is a good thing, less nade spam like in cod and battlefield.overal it feels a lot like wolfestein et to me, which for me is good. there's a only a handful of small maps sadly, but they are made very well. i wish they had a sdk like wolfet had, so people could make more maps, that's really what this game needs imo, more small maps. it got a lot of big maps for tanks and stuff, but ultimately that's a huge battle of which team has the most 1000 hour players and or payers (pay 2 win) and are therefore less fun to me. now you can have fun being free2play but a lot less. this game kinda requires you to have a subscription running in order to make a little money.i hope they go for a new business model with this or a new game because this model really upset most people. the only reason i stick is because it reminds me a lot of wolfet my favorite shooter like ever. it's not the same, but it gives me the same dopamine rush so it works for me. i really wish they made it less grindy and find another way to monitize so it doesn't put people off.also this game is not full with sweaty try hards so casual players got a decent chance at this imo. as a casual myself. of course sometimes there are a few sweaty try hards who annihilate you, but that's it.",1

2957,"yes, the game is really fun and addictive. at 918+ hours i can say it is a true pay to win game. i do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money. there is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for xp so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ton of nickel and dimes. you will earn those same xp during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp. it takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in tank battles). good luck earning xp by just playing. long story short, this game sucks for pvp because of pay to win. but is the best i have seen in a while for what i call eye candy (realistic looking models and fx) and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.ps. i would accept war thunder gold lion donations! lol",0

13726,there are very few games these days that surprise me but this is one of them. i was not expecting much when it popped up on my steam front page but i gave it a try and i am so glad that i did. the comparison i would make would be this. creativerse is to minecraft what cities skylines is to simcity. everyone has their own opinion of course but to me that is what the game feels like. a much more polished version of the original game with some cool new additions.if you like minecraft don't hesitate to get this game. i doubt you'll be disappointed.,1

(such graphic) the community. best community ever. i mean it. the fact that i get to talk to developers. and be listened to 0.0 it makes me feel special.

2013,"stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. path of exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. no pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. path of exile was meant to be the diablo 2 successor that i've always dreamed of... but is it?the first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. the character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true diablo formula. there's plenty of strategy to implement here. i thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.but where did it all go wrong?the second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. cruel difficulty is terribly unbalanced. you will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. this function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience. grinding gear games didn't get the memo, it seems. regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and cruel penalties. my desire to play was crushed once i was met with this awful formula. as an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.due to this massive difficulty boost, you require a build to survive. there is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional mmo). it essentially becomes a game like dark souls - a game for masochists. a game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. to even scrape by.these are the reasons why i do not recommend this game. the beginning showed lots of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. there's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the dark souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.thankfully, i didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. i hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0
