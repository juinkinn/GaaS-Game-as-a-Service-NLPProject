7953,hard to write a review when all you do is disconnect from the server. i have scanned the forums for a fix to this problem or even just an indication to why it may be happening and there is absolutely no help there. pity as this game has the hallmarks of being a good game to waste countless hours.,0
2995,"at it current state(.) is to expensive to play the game, if you don't have premium account you can't progress at all because of the repair cost and even if you do have you can't make mistakes if you want to have enough silver lions to buy another vehicle, stock vehicle are the worst, planes isn't that much but you still can feel a difference, the big problem here are mainly tanks were if you don't have repairs and fpe(extinguisher) you are useless if they get any of the parts of the tank unless you get to the capture point to repair (if they get your engine you can't do anything), matchmaking is too compressed so sometimes you get games where your tank or your plane lacks too much compared to others and still with the compression takes some time to get into battle depending on your rank(if you don't get a small game with - people, wich are decided on the first min of the game), this game have become a pw or even worst than that because at it current state premium isn't helping that much, a premium vehicle and account are a must if you want to grind anything or even play(keep in mind that you can only reasearch vehicles of the same nation that your premium vehicle is), can't recommend this game at all anymore if you want to have fun and even spend money into something i would recommend world of tanks(warships or planes) those games aren't perfect too, but are in a better state or even buy a game from steam that will be better.",0

4727,"this game is pay to win.how? you ask? well, let me just say this...i was playing my first casual joust match when i noticed a character was flying above me, he then landed on me and killed me with some finger pistols, or some.. apparently it was the god apollo i thought, huh, that kinda seems unfair... there's a god that can just fly above you in this game and become completely untargetable?? that's so ing t!! but i let it slide... (mind you apollo is not even a default god, and you need a currency called 'gems' to buy gods in this game) (there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money...) so, after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods ao kuang thanatos and guess who get again? yep, you guessed it. apollo. i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that, but to top it off ao kuang and thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and there's no way to escape it, you just instantly die... and it heals ao kuang and then he can fly away and do even more damage, so after my teammate got eaten by an ao kuang, which then landed on me killing me? i just uninstalled. (((none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money) oh yeah, and before i even started playing, there's some gods they released that they didn't even finish, causing massive balance issues. such as hel, artio, and ullr, they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game. if hi-rez fixes these things, i will make my review positive, but as if now i can not reccomend this game.tl;dr: pay to win game with no updates since after devs abandoned the game, dead community, and extreme balance issues.",0

4399,duel links is blast from the past. you play speed format meaning zones to summon and spell/trap. some players may not like this and are looking for a classic style if so there are other games out there for that.all characters you can play as are voiced in any language you want or no voice at all.you have skills that you can equip to your deck to give you some extra effects. like starting the duel with a field spell in play or getting polymerisation for your next draw if you take or more damage. so the strategy stems farther then just building a deck with your favorite character.the game is not pay to win like a lot of other users may clam as you can get gems to buy packs and decks pretty easy from normal play you can get more faster by paying but i haven’t spent more the $ or $ and i have most decks you can buy from the shop and i only been playing less than a month. one thing i really like is how you buy packs from the shop there’s a set number and a list of all the current cards you can get in the pack with a number telling how many are left you can get. this means if you really want a card from a pack just keep buying the same pack you will get it at some point because with every pack you buy your chances go up.the only issue i'm having right now are a few over powered cards and decks in this format. in the future i hope they start a ban list for ranked duels to force people to stop using copy paste decks they find on the internet.,1

2641,"the good: game is marvelpiece from technical standpoint - beautiful graphics, good sound and all is well optimised. tank and aircraft models are very detailed, there is considerable customisation as well. plethora of vehicles, real and paper projects to toy with.the bad: balance isn't the best, with worst offender being top tiers, particularly jets. aircraft gameplay resolves around destroying ground targets, so if you're up for fighter to fighter combat, you won't win many games. tank gameplay is one shot in nature, as often single penetrating shell is enough to kill crew and/or detonate ammo racks, which leads to rather campy gameplay. arcade mode with its respawn is both boon and curse - if one team collapses, it inevitably leads to spawnkilling. realistic is aquired taste, unfortunately driving/flying for few minutes only to die in boom isn't exactly my flavor.the ugly: grind. on positive, you can research entire tech tree using only one vehicle. in theory, in practice its unlikely to happen before heat death of universe. player progress is deliberately slowed down by need to research and buy at least vehicles of current tier before progressing, which doesn't stop less competent players from playing more advanced toys. obtaining your oh so expected new toy, be it tank or plane is only the beginning - after all you've bought junk of a vehicle and you need to upgrade it and with tanks (and upcoming warships) its especially bad. you can't repair your tank and you can't extinguish fires without researched spare parts and fire ex. while on low level vehicles its matter of few battles to get these, on top tiers it can take well over battles to get anything, with hundreds of battles needed to unlock all upgrades.pw - while there are no premium vehicles that are straight up overpowered (at least i'm not aware of them), there are plenty of options to gain advantage with open wallet. first - instantly buying upgrades for vehicles, its not so much pw as its sanity saviour, especially on high tier vehicles. second - crew. for gold eagles you can level up crew considerably, especially in sensitive aspects like vitality or reload speed. third - increasing vehicle rooster. free player can bring up to vehicles into battle, paying player can bring . so should arcade air prove so hectic, paying player can in theory outlast non paying ones. arcade tanks are limited to vehicles, so no issue there if one can prepare his/her lineups correctly.tl;dr if you can accept grind and/or limiting yourself to early vehicles and you're willing to learn basics (especially air combat), go for it.",0

10813,"like many others i grew up as a typical teenage magic nerd and naturally i am interested in any digital version that could capture me the same way. other than the timeless and amazing shandalar, i have yet too find a really decent and accessible digital competitor, until now!eternal is far from archaic and has happily and correctly snapped up all the best things about hearthstone, while also integrating the best of the more advanced mechanics from magic the gathering. pros:+ clear and inviting interface. smooth graphics and decent art for an indy title. performance is very good and i have yet to encounter any disconnects or crashes. the cards and their actions are all very nicely and satisfyingly animated. it is very reminiscent of heartstone in this regard. lots of attention to details, like high power creatures having an extra 'oomph' when they do damage+ the card-playing mechanics are significantly improved and much more in-depth than hearthstone. one of the key factors here is the way blocking works. just like magic, you can't just attack whatever creature you want. rather you declare your attackers and the opponent can then choose to block them (or not) and assign his blockers as seems best. this is a fundamental change from hs and it makes the game feel much more strategic. you also have interaction with the graveyard, interrupt spells, artifacts, attachments (enchantments) and plenty of dimensions you can build your decks around, including new ones not seen in classic mtg or hs.+ similarly, the game uses a mix between hearthstone and magic when it comes to mana. you need to budget for mana cards and there are many variants of them. this adds an extra dimension to deck-building as many creatures and spells directly interact with them. it can result in some dead hands although this is very rare (the game secretly ensure you get two power cards should you decide to mulligan)+ despite offering more depth, the game is far more accessible and generous than hs. the devs have correctly understood that for a game like this to gain traction when hs is so dominant on the scene, you need to let players get a lof of cards quickly so you can open up the choices. almost anything you can do in the game results in a constant flow of cards, be it ranked, gauntlet, forge or draft. you also get lots of crafting dust so you can get those key cards to make your deck work and there are plenty of quest rewards and themed decks coming your way.+ the four game types mentioned above are likewise very well designed. ranked is your standard ladder. forge is very similar to arena in hs. you pick from three options at a time until you have cards, then you play against a gauntlet of ais, each win upping your reward. draft is a direct derivative of magic's drafting format. you and other players take turns picking cards from random booster packs, and then you craft a -card deck. you then have a gauntlet of real players to beat. did i mention that in both forge and draft you get to keep all cards?+ balance is on-point to the extent that it can be for the moment. so far i haven't seen any outrageous or unfair cards that cannot be countered. some deck types will lose to others more often than not, but that's just card games for you. there is of course a meta and i'm sure the deck types narrow as you go further up the ranks.cons:- i honestly don't have any serious complaints to mention. the game is still early access but it certainly feels like a full game. the casual mode is not yet active, and that is a bit annoying. when you try out new decks, gauntled mode against the ai won't really give you a good benchmark and you are going to be hesitant to take it straight to ranked. luckily you can still play against your friends as much as you like, as if it were casual. - i would like to see a tournament mode added into the game as well. it would be a lot of fun to participate in elimination-style competitions against other players and of course your friends on a daily basis, with rewards for finishing in the top or . larger seasonal tournaments would be really cool as well. edit:- one serious issue with the game currently is the mandatory campaign tutorial. you have to play games for each color, for a total of games, one of which can take a good few tries. you are limited to really poor starter decks that are very boring to play. this can really turn off a lot of players and it takes a good - hours to get through. if i hadn't already known this going in, i might not have continued playing and that would have been a great shame. i really hope the devs revisit and shortens this soon. mandatory games would've been plenty. gauntlet mode is already a great way to learn the game.in summary: a great free-to-play title with a complete lack of paywalls or pay-to-win mechanics. it combines the best of magic and hs into a brilliant mix and you will get addicted.",1

9725,"okay, so having played this game for four years now, i'd like to think that i can certainly be considered a reputable source of information in regards to its quality, so here goes.so, i began playing back in , during the period of time where add had just been released in the na servers. i was drawn to the game by add himself, as i really adored the character design.so i started playing, and to -year-old, anime-obsessed me, this game was the greatest thing ever. this was mainly in part due to my general inexperience with games, as i was just starting to really get into them. i'd played a decent bit up to this point, but nothing of the highest quality(my main games at the time were gta: sa, gmod, and tf lol). it was also due to me adoring anything really anime-related, and being easily entertained.now, while i will say that elsword has some positive features. its main selling point, i would say, in my own personal opinion, would be its characters, the most interesting of which i consider to be add, who, as stated before, was the initial reason i began playing the game in the first place. it also has a decent overall storyline, although it's got relatively poorly translated dialogue.elsword also features some pretty simple, yet fun, gameplay, and although playing with friends or in a group can make your in-game experience much more fun, it can also just as easily be entertaining to play the game alone.however, this game has many problems, and unfortunately, i'm afraid that the bad far outweighs the good. the main problem lies in the greediness of the company that runs the game. now, this same thing can be said for most, if not all, free-to-play games, but we're focusing on elsword for this so we'll disregard that. if you don't want to look like a noob, and you really want to have a generally positive experience playing the game, expect to fork out plenty of money for in-game items.another problem is the poor management. in the four years that i've played the game, i've had a few issues, and through contacting support, have had a whopping of them solved. in addition to this, most of the in-game events are almost, if not downright, insulting. like getting a costume set for days, and having no way of keeping it, unless you spend at least $ to get it, and that's if it's featured in the item mall.now, cosmetics in general are another big issue. the premium cosmetics give a clear and overwhelming advantage over players who pay nothing to play the game. there is no way to earn these costumes aside from paying. now, they have recently implemented a section in the in-game item shop where certain items, including certain costume sets, can be purchased with the in-game, non-premium currency, which at first glance, is a big step in the right direction. however, these costume sets are ones that nobody would or should actually want to use, which brings me to my next point.ice burner costume sets.these are the costumes that everyone uses, that give the unfair advantage over free-to-play players. if you want one(a good one, that is), expect to pay at the very least $, unless you get reeeaaally lucky. these costume sets give significant stat boosts, and thus the advantage over other players, who cannot gain them through means aside from paying actual money.what's more is that, lately the game has been taking a turn in that, if you haven't forked out hundreds upon hundreds of dollars to build up your equipment, get magic amulets to enhance your equipment really high, and get the aforementioned ice burner sets, you're outright not going to be able to participate in certain, in-game activities, such as higher-level dungeons that were recently added at the time of this editing. you will not have the chance to join other players in the newest raid, and even the add's energy fusion theory dungeon, which you do by yourself, you will not be able to do. and if you were able to enter these dungeons, for simplicity's sake i'll just say, you're gonna have a bad time.summing everything up, elsword has potential. however, that potential is wasted on the current management. while i'm fond of the franchise overall(aside from the god-awful attempt at an anime adaptation), i'm afraid that the game itself is a disappointment.and do not get me ing started on the english voices",0

5974,"if you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game. like others have mentioned , the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying , it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying. but then the experience is really rewarding. if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process. now in my book there are types of fans when it comes to flying games . lets see ...- the first type only want to grab the stick (or keyboard) and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else. if you are from this type then go for battlefield series , hawx or war thunder..etc. don't bother with dcs . you will have hours of fun with the other titles that i mentioned. and trust me , there are some really good ones out there and i've personally tried most of them . - this type of fans love flying and don't mind getting into some details about planes but they don't want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details. if you belong in this category , look up flaming cliffs on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading. - these are plane nerds. they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane. they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so. if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading ? go download dcs and have fun . thank me later. now ... if you are the first type ... don't bother with dcs. there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun. dcs is for the other types . if you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. dcs has non-clickable cockpits in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. but here is the thing. you can by fc and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for dcs you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but keep reading .finally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where you actually need to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because dcs not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to fsx or fg and see the difference. as a final note , some say the planes are expensive. i believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the dcs' website. usually you can by all planes for % off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . i say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with dcs:fc . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.",1

15360,literally an very funny game with friends. it's actually monopoly so you'll have many funny moments and rage moments. but there is a little thing that make's online playing unplayable. this game is pw af. everything you're doing in the game can be improved through the credit card. like if you have an unlucky dice result it can be rolled again. that make's the game to a thing where the funny moments (rage moments cuz unlucky dice result) disappear. that make's it boring and annoying together. it's a game if you're bored and doesn't have to do something better,1

8735,"where to start.this game, was actually the one battle royal, that hooked me from the start.i was loving it, everything about it.the classes were cool, the forgeing part was epic, and the fact that mounts would remove the feeling of yet another running simulator-game, was amazing. very fast paced, since camping was not an option if you wanted to have a fair chance in the end.updates started dropping, and the game become more and more casual-friendly. legendary drops from chests, and removal of chicken trophies, which was fine, but still not as satisfying as the first few patches.doomsday for this game hit when they decided to remove the classes all along. not only did they remove the classes, but they remove one of the skill slots, along with all epic and legendary weapons.this would be fine, if you atleast could have the abbility too craft weapons above uncommon-tier.i reccomended this for a group of friends, and they all loved it.today, no, i would not reccomend it.",0

17289,"okay, so i've gotten up to level and this game just has a few problems.: definitely freemium. the microtransactions are everywhere and pushed all the time. you can buy a subscription, but that doesn't make the microtransactions go away, it just gives you a bonus pack of stuff and a certain amount of microtransaction currency each month. % of the content is locked behind real-money purchasing. : broken in several places, one being a floating fish, which rotated merrily and once i saw it, i could no longer play the fishing minigame, which is required to keep your dragon's energy up. also, the fireballs in the flight club game (which is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game so far) will refuse to lock onto targets, and you can't fire manually, which makes a fair few of the levels impossible to %. : looks terrible. these aren't good graphics for a pc game. they're not even good graphics for an ipad game. : controls are not rebindable. you're stuck clicking go fast and go slow buttons like an idjit. : has you walk everywhere for the first several hours of the game. i don't know how long away i was from being able to fly on my dragon, but that's what was promised me. of course, i could turn my baby dragon into an adult immediately for gems. or five dollars. : is a learning game oriented towards children. spent a half hour teaching me the scientific method as part of a required quest.: has farmville in it. literally. a farming minigame where you plant and tend crops, harvest and sell those crops, and then buy more seeds to plant crops with. it is implied that this part of the game is heavily important. i didn't stick around to find out.: if you stand next to a cliff, then rotate rapidly, your dragon will fall off the cliff and be lost to the nether void, only to pop back into existence when you enter a new area. : the voice acting doesn't match the text in the boxes. petty, i know, but super annoying.: the high scores on everything are hacked. : literally everything about the game ever.this is the worst mmo i've ever played. hell, it might be the worst game i've ever played, period. not that there aren't worse games, there's plenty of worse games, but those were worse because the game developers didn't know what they were doing. this is a game that started off from one of the most beautiful animated movies, with clever characters and a wonderful landscape, and was run through the corporate meat grinder with the smallest amount of effort. hell, the company that made it is a subsidiary of blizzard, so they should know how to make an mmo. it's almost like the developers hated this game right from the start. and they nonchalantly took one of my favorite animated ips and screwed it into the ground with no hope of some soothing ointment for afters. it's worse because it was deliberately ruined.-deda",0

11320,"everything about this game should be great, but they ruined it with a horrible resource requirement. much like mtg, there are cards like 'mana' resources which are dealt in your card draw. it results in those games where you could be the best player in the world but lose to bad luck of drawing only resource cards every hand, or never drawing one at all and not being able to play your cards. why this is still a mechanic is baffling. it's so flawed and other games have fixed it. my suggestion is either deal two cards per turn and let players play one face down as a resource and lose it (adjust the deck characteristics, obviously.) or just do it turn based like some other similar games do. both of those options eliminate a great deck or player losing to bad luck. mtg has had that problem and has been around for over years, and it's always been a problem that people hate. why go back to that? other than that they are sitting on a truly great card game. but it is like building the greatest boat in world and putting screen doors on the bottom of it. it is painful to see something so close to greatness completely ruined by such a cringy face-palm of a decision like needing resource cards in your deck. this game, besides that awful game-ruining mechanic is immediately obviously an easy / for deck battling card games. but with that flawed mechanic, i, in my brief but perceptive opinion, am so disappointed at losing to bad luck without having a chance, it gets knocked down to a /. please change this stupid mechanic, it really does the beautiful complex game a slap in the face, to be mild.",0

14517,"really want free jam to read this and new players to understand that i am speaking from a veteran's pov. this isn't meant to be a harsh. i want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. i can't recommend this game yet but i do encourage people to try it. robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before i can safely recommend it (i really enjoy the game, i want to emphasize that... i also want to emphasize that with each update, i have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). i want to give an overview of how i feel about robocraft and i will try to give an effective outline of what i want to say. this isn't me defending or bashing the game. this review is meant to be fair.i want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how i feel about it. i want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. i want to briefly mention the factory. i want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). i want to talk about some issues i have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical it sucks or i love crushing noobs or i get crushed by every meta/ pro user) and offer a solution. i want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. i want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. i want to talk about robocraft's community (there is might be some salt in here. be warned). finally, i will finalize with the largest problem i see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (if this is resolved, then i think it will help the game as a whole).the current movement system is very player friendly. you can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. i am not even joking. i made a ugandan knuckles fly. you can make tanks as well via tank treads. mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ rd person point of view games. camera controls are set as default to help people out. keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). i don't advise them in tier . heli-copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very overpowered. currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. my solution is that hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. insect legs are very bad. they don't do as their were originally intended to do. when i use them, even when i don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. they don't cling to ceilings. as a solution, i made insect bots that do these things but i had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (if interested, look up block widdow or the hanger in the factory, use keyboard controls). the hanger demonstrates perfectly what i want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. the block widdow demonstrates what i want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like the hanger is able to do. if insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. the current weapon balance in tier is... terrifying. the mega plasma (with the help of the trusty power module) can completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. the rail impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a rapid fire precision based weapon. the mega smg gun, well, its fine. the flak cannon is seriously weak. the loml deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. the mortar got nerfed hard, which i don't know how i feel about that since i started maining it until it got nerfed. the shotgun (ion distorter) feels useless. until weapons are balanced in way that is satisfying to free jam (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. i feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. i am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (i consider block spam as the control group in this position). p. s. t smgs need an increased fire rate.the factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. the factory made a war between fighters and builders. the fighters obviously win. i see far less builders than i do fighters in tier . the same goes to t. i don't think there should be t/t bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. i have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.in regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, i feel like they are too small. the old maps from the beginning, were really cool but i think free jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. i think there needs ro be more maps. more maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.in regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but i think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. when this game gets its player base up again, have a league mode where all teirs are meshed together. keep the current tier system the same. in regards to custom games, i think there should be a public/ private settings on it. i mean like allow people to random join. people will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. the matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. for when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.the community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. this will turn off new players to this game. i don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. when free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. free jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of the game is dead. other than that, the community is cool. lots of people are willing to help out. also, new players shouldn't be able to get access to t parts so easily.now to get to the root problem that plagues free jam. the main center of conflict that free jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. solutions? well i think if free jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. for content ideas, i would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. i would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. thank you for your time. i encourage free jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. again i can't recommend this game yet but i encourage people to try this game and share their views on it and to share ideas.",1

12996,"it's... okay.it fits solidly in the catagory of being a waiting game with options to pay to get things done quicker. nothing is impossible to get without paying for it though. and - if complaints made in the discussion threads are true - paying for things is risky since it's completely possible it'll just take your money and not give you what you paid for. but again there's no reason to pay for it. the game is pretty generous on giving you ample lunchboxes (chests of rare loot) and nuka colas (items used to speed up wait times) for free on quests and for accomplishing achievements.the s.p.e.c.i.a.l. stats are not what they are in other games. when it comes to combat the endurance (hp) and agility (attack rate) stats are the only factors. combat is pretty much a watch the characters do all the work automatically thing while you give them a stimpack or radaway when needed. the closest thing you get to any tactical decisions is whether or not you'll use a charged-up critical attack now or save it for later in case it's needed. that's it.as a fallout franchise fan myself i wanted to dabble with it a little. it pokes at my nostalgia. i see a lot of familier weapons and armors from the games. it feels like someone that didn't actually play much of fallout made it. they may have peeked at the wiki, looked at some screenshots, talked to the devs, ect but they weren't likely actual fans of the series themselves. there were just too many thats not how it works moments. which brings me to...lore nitpicksvaults, in fallout shelter, send out radio signals to add to their population. in any other fallout game vaults are pretty xenophobic. other vaults seem much more happy to see your dwellers visit than they ought to as well. to put this into the realistic light: in fallout you are sent out of your vault to find a water chip. you save your vault eventually - as well as potentially other places depending how you play. but the overseer abandons you because you've been outside of the vault too long and are deemed an outsider for that alone. your character is left outside to what the overseer can only assume will be your death. fallout 's overseer was even worse.deathclaws appear in packs similar to molerats or radroaches. in any other version of this series when you get a whiff of a single deathclaw you're on high alert. in this case however you brawl through of them to get through a room. this game failed so hard on what makes a deathclaw a deathclaw.in some quests feral ghouls talk to the vault dwellers. feral ghouls; the ones that have rotted out minds and are completely senseless zombies that just scream and growl and attack anything with flesh.the vault door - the big iconic cog-shaped door - responsible for holding off the explosion of a nuclear bomb and protect the residents from outside danger falls apart during raider attacks as though it's made of paper mache. typically about hits with a sword tears a hole right through it - i don't mean they knock the door down. i mean they rip right through it.conclusionit's oddly addictive. it's free even if it's an obvious cash grab. it's okay as a time killer or as a game that you might play on the side while doing something else - like reading or youtube. it's nothing great though. even the guys that made this game probably don't like it enough to play or update it.",1

15430,"i regret getting into this.i very quickly became...well, for lack of a better term...obsessed.i would buy chests whenever they would do the free golden upgrade when you buy a chest! over the course of playing this game i've spent quite a pretty penny. you can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals, which is why they would sucker me in. there is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall. that is where i draw the line between a good free to play game and a bad one. this is a bad one with grabby money tactics. and for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added, there a special limited time only chests to buy to get equipment just for them!! it honestly just feels so scammy. the prices are a lot for what you are getting. you do not get a good value, at all, don't let their sales fool you. don't waste your money on this game. they add only benched heroes, no actual new ones...so, in other words, you are perpetually swapping out your favorite crusaders for the new cash-grab flavor of the event crusaders (that are almost always better). there are a few positives, such as a nice passive trait tree they've added. but, let me warn you, this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact. same. thing. over. and. over. and. over. you will hardly ever switch up your technique (until the new flavor of the event) because that one group is effective for anything you'd do. i am a lover of idle games...just not this one. try tap titans instead. it is superior to this game tenfold. and they don't lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases.note: if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money, and you don't mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so, don't mind the pointless grind (because you aren't really working towards anything worth getting, even though they do have a passive way to spent idols...it just doesn't feel rewarding), and if you don't mind using the same crusaders (because they never add any new heroes, they only add heroes to existing benches... it's hard to explain if you don't play the game. you'll have to swap out your favorite heroes for the flavor of the event)...if you don't mind any of that, you will like this game.i, on the other hand, am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who, when all is said and done, gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than aaa/indie developers of real games will get... and that is just sad. from now on, i pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers...those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap.edit: i wish that i could find a screenshot. i can't help but laugh hysterically... the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on!!! a set of chests costs $!! they used to be .$!! and, get this, buy an event jeweled chest bundle today and get a free golden epic card that you won't find anywhere else!. and there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on... holy scam. please, please, don't support these developers.stop giving them money. i beg you not to do it. don't fall into the trap. we, as people, have to tell devleopers that this is the wrong way of making money. why are these online prices, something you will never see or feel in your hand, something that is temporary, something that is completely rng (you most likely will get crap out of your chests you buy for $ because they want you to buy a bunch of them... chests for $ would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent...)...something that is not guaranteed should never be that much money!! this market isn't for the customers, despite it's free nature...those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth. maybe i am alone in this...maybe not. only time will tell how this market goes.",0
2396,"don't let the steam hours decieve you, i have played over k+ hours of this game.---i started playing poe on the th of february, . at that time, the game was in closed beta, it was hard to get a key to get in. i've been playing the game on and off ever since.first i'd like to start with some pros and cons.+ unlimited replayability.+ insanely fun.+ difficult to master.+ very good economy system.+ it pays off to play with friends.+ well made microtransaction-system.- desync.- starts off slow if youre a beginner.the game is very big. it consists of acts, featuring difficulties plus an end-game map system, with a level cap of . it even comes with races and recently they've included special leagues with special formats and gimmicks that the normal standard and hardcore versions don't have. the game features one of (if not) the biggest passive-tree in all of video-gaming. it is a very big thing, it's what makes path of exile what it is. all of the different combinations of skills and passives you can do is endless, you will never do every single combination. skills aren't granted through the tree, skills are given to you using different gems, which are given to you through completing the games story-line and finding them by killing things.the economy system of poe is very interesting, it consists of orbs that you will find while killing things, these orbs are the currency. for a list of all the currency click here.[www.pathofexile.com] using these orbs you can trade for different items with other players aswell as with npcs inside of the towns or your own hideout.well, how does ggg make money of this game?ggg makes money by their fantastic microtransaction model. it is -all- cosmetics with some convinence items (stash expansions, these are a great way of supporting the game if you dislike the cosmetics).the game is hard, it's not easy to play and it's definetly not easy to adapt to the desyncs and such. you will your first character up. i recommend visiting the poe forums at first and finding a build labeled cheap and then following that for your first character. playing with friends definetly pays off as it makes the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally makes the leveling phase alot more enjoyable. the game even gives you a +% increased drops per person in your party.overall, the game is alot of fun with very few flaws, biggest one being the desync, but if you enjoy playing arpgs, or if you disliked d, this game is definetly worth trying out. and if you never have played before, don't play on standard, it's practicly the dumpster of all leagues.",1

3120,"this game has the potential to be one of the greatest flight sims ever. the selection of aircraft and tanks is absolutely enormous. there is a diffuculty mode for everyone, the flight models are decent, the damage model kinda sucks but it's not terrible. the aircraft and especially the tanks are very well detailed.i just wish i had the ability to enjoy them all. unfortuately, you can't. you will be stuck in the first and second tier early war stuff for hundreds of hours. i have a buddy who has been playing this game for years. he has over , hours in the game. he is a level . herein lies the problem of the game.you start off with the worst pssible vehicles, which is understandable. these are the bottem of the barrel planes and tanks. they are slow, they can not turn worth a damn, they have guns that mearly tickle your opponent, and they blow up when someone looks at you funny. you are stuck in these until you can get enough kill assists to unlock a new vehicle. you aren't killing anything with a mm cannon on the early tanks, or the pair of . cals you get in the peashooter. once you get those, you continue the grind upwards. it seems your first vehicle in any tier is just asking to be blown up. and, at every tier, every vehicle cost exponentially more. you would think that at higher tiers this wouldn't be a problem as you would be making more money, but you'd be wrong. you can take out a mustang, down two aircraft and return to base, only to find out that you still haven't broken even. at this point in the game, it can cost , lions to buy an aircraft and another , just to train the crew. it gets so goddamn grindy.now, the lower tiers are more fun. usually you can break even, fly against somewhat balance aircraft (panzer iv as a first tier tank. wut? i've put heat rounds through the front, hitting crew every time, and they can still one shot me through the mantlet), and enjoy the game without having to worry about shelling out shekels to the jewish developers just to fly your planes. grinding to unlock a plane in a a free to play game? understandable. grinding low tierjust to fly high tier stuff you've already got? not understandable.absolutely the most frustrating game i have ever played. and the worst part about it is how much potential it has. potential wasted by money grabbing penny pinching jews that are gaijin.",0

11753,"well having played the game for only a couple of days, i can not give a comprehensive review. i can however speak regarding the the more constant complaints. take them with a grain of salt. the people complaining seem mostly hung up on things that i do not see. crying that the game is too hard now because they nerfed damage output is chief among them currently. having played the game before and after this change, i can say that the game was far too easy before the change, and if i am honest i still find it quite easy afterwards, but at least players need to pay attention now, previously short of playing blindfolded it was not challenging at all. another common complaint is optimisiation. again i do not see it. i am able to play the game cleanly on medium () everything with - fps . this is better then i expected given that my video card is a r x, and typically takes a dump playing with k resolution. if there is a point to this babbling it is this. unhappy people cry and complain, satisfied people don't. keep that in mind when reading the complaints. hopefully the devs do not cave too much to the criers and ruin the game trying to appease them. not everyone wants everything handed to them, not everyone wants to go from lvl to level cap in a day, but the people who do are happy to vocalize how much it sucks when they can't. there are balance issues pvp wise from what i can tell, and there is content that still needs to be added, there is work yet to do. thats why they call it early access, this is to be expected, but thus far most of what seems to be wrong with this game is the people who play it.",1

10803,"even bigger rng fest than curvestone because you have cards in decks (with up to copies of the same card), so your draws are very inconsistent.more often than not you are left with either excess sigils (i.e. lands from mtg) or creatures/weapons/spells you can't play because you didn't draw sigils to do that.because of the two reasons above most of the people play aggro decks where many of the cards cost or less. imagine a game where everyone is playing small creatures and hits face... pretty sad.another bad thing about this game is that there are no comebacks at all: if one of the players is winning, he's winning by a lot.granted, the developers are trying to fix this by changing the redraw mechanics (didn't help because you can't redraw a single card, you either keep your whole hand or discard all of the cards) and by introducing weekly quests when you have to win with a predefined deck that is not aggro. but again, the outcome of the matches is so dependent on what you draw, it's not fun even to win as you know your skill has little to do with that. and losing to ideal top decks made by your opponent is even more frustrating than in curvestone.there were games i couldn't play anything by turn because i got a bad hand, and after redrawing still got only + cost cards and sigils. and playing against aggro decks that means you are dead.on a good side, there's also a mode (similar to hs's arena) where you make a deck from random cards. and this mode is actually much better than ranking because you have only cards in the deck so your draws are much more consistent. and you get to keep all the cards you get in the draft! alas, this leads to another problem: most of the cards in the draft are common, so you can't possibly explore all the mechanics the game has to offer.***everything else in the game (art and visuals, sound, single player campaign, card design) is really well done, but inconsistent draws and aggro decks ruin all the fun.p.s. on top of rng draws, this game has some really counter intuitive interactions. for instance, when you attack and the opponent blocks your creatures with his creatures, you can cast fast spells. so, when you kill one of the blockers with a fast spell (so your blocked creature can attack face), your creature simply doesn't attack at all but becomes exhausted (meaning it also can't block enemy creatures this turn)!another weird interaction is when the opponent blocks your non-flying creature with his non-flying creature and you give your creature fly this turn via fast spell, his creature is still able to block your creature even though non-flying creatures can't block flying ones.what's the point of fast spells if you can't surprise your opponent or bait him into blocking/attacking and then ruin his strategy with a spell?",0

8649,"realm royale is a game that exists. it has a lot of bugs, but it is redeemed by the fact it's in alpha and it's unique gameplay.the class system is interesting, to say the least. hunter and mage are my two favorites. the shard system is where you can essentially scrap weapons and abilities you don't want or can't use then you can go to a forge that's shown on the map and you can craft armor, weapons, health potions, and armor potions. another cool thing about rr is the chicken mechanism. once you get shot or downed you become a chicken. you can bounce around and you can't use any items or abilities for seconds i think (not sure). at one point in a game, i was downed and ran around a bush until i was revived automatically and shot the guy who downed me. probably the coolest moment i've had yet.a lot of the abilities and weapons are ripped straight from paladins, just without any of the names used. i recognized cassie's crossbow, androxus's pistol, barik's shotgun, and several other weapons. on the abilities side, they are almost exclusively from paladins. one ability allows you to freeze for several seconds and it heals you while another can throw a molotov.lastly, the mounts are so great. you can just hold down z and ride off on it. this makes traversing the map super easy, a hindrance found often in a lot of other games in the genre. another random thing i liked was the waypoints. they are a beacon in game that you can see from almost anywhere on the map and are super helpful instead of having to look at your map constantly or the compass to figure out where you set your waypoint to.but even with all of these things, rr has a plethora of issues. t-posing, mount poses when they're not on their mount, lots of rubber banding at random times, bushes and trees and grass can be found floating in random locations on the map so the map needs polish, and some of the classes need a bit of work like the engineer. i hope to see the bugs and glitches fixed, while also balancing any aspects of the game that need it since the game is still in alpha. i've met a handful of people on the game in the time i have played which is a stark contrast compared to fortnite where it's filled with try-hards and -year-olds.",1

1180,product received for freeearly access reviewi was expecting bad.what i have found is a neat space like moba.twenty hours into the game i still find it highly enjoyable. there are a few flaws here and there but nothing entirely game breaking.the cash shop is in no way a hinderence to a player and nor does it truly give an advantage.everything aside from cosmetics can be obtained from regular playing. it may take time but you can get anything you want without spending a dime.one of the defining and enjoyable factors of this game i have fun with; is that all ships and i do mean all of them. all ships have a value and merit. starter ships are just as viable late game as they are the first day you log in and most likely get your spacehanded to you because you engaged combat alone or something moba newbie like.once again i cannot stree enough that this game is a moba. treated like one it's an amazingly unique experience to the genre.as a self proclaimed moba addict i can see this one going in my games for time spent.+ hours later-this game is the only decent space game for pvp i can find. many others quote other space games of differening genres.it has flaws here and there in things that can be worked on but after so many hours playing and judging. my final hour mark of this game leaves me at: i really enjoy it and despite the bs about ships of different tier being better. this is t. i get mykicked by low tier ships all the time.this is one of those hidden gems that had i listened to half these negative reviews i would of just wrote this game off. facts are most of these reviews are done by ragey people who didn't understand the game.to judge a game without understanding is foolish.,1

13804,"so in short, the game is fun. but it has some flaws that are holding it back from wider popularity. first of all there is an audio bug that causes feedback of varying degrees during matches that can really ruin the experience for some. second, the game could use some tutorials to explain the roles of the different ship types and how to effectively use them together. beyond that, the game is gorgeous and plays very well. as someone who has been playing since the initial alpha i think the game is in a good place. overall, this is the best shape the game has been in and i expect it to continue improving. if you find yourself routinely losing, look at your ships modules and what their focus is. not every ship within the same class plays in a similar way. starting at tier you are given the tools to really shape your gameplay into anything you want it to be. the game could do more to guide you in those roles but it's still a good one despite that.",1

5646,good fun game but dumb stats of tanks too try and lvl things out. sniper tanks cant see far but there gun is for hitting tanks or other tanks miles away. dumb dumb dumb. even the mighty teir grille cant see sh it teir tanks have the same view range or better lol sad game. history has this td and or other tanks shooting many shots at the good guys tanks before the good guys can even get in range or ambush them with big gun. but the game is fun even with all the changes in the years of playing all the tanks are different now then what they where. the game makers know that these tanks are not balanced thats why they were made stopthings up so much. so after all this time i vote so so game $$$ s out there wow gold bullets all over there are lots. ps try to play for fun it;s hard sometimes but try.,0

7916,"(steam reported hours /th of my playtime, standalone launcher used mostly)all in all, an incredible implementation of the d&d universe, all fans will be thrilled especially with dragon fights! (omg!) loads of content, stunning environments, easy to learn yet hard to master - meaning you can simply mash your way through as a dumb hero, or become a god if you apply yourself - and an rpg well worth putting time into.the amount of content and weeks of gametime provided in the fp model is incredible. the voice acting is world class and the quests vary from profound to wonderfully ridiculous. if you then choose after finally completing all of the story content, which is immense, to then push for the end game content or pvp, you can attain equal footing through some grinding (which is still fun in a group), or you can go ahead and pay the people who gave you this all for free and continue to play with the grinding aspect lowered at that level.alternatevily there are regular events (all grand fun) and many other dungeons you can immerse yourself in without end game gear and have a fantastic time just exploring all the locations properly or socialising in one of the very many highly active guilds.people complaining about pw must get off their high horse as i fail to see how they expect servers to magically stay active and fresh content (in this games case pretty much monthly) appear without the programmers getting paid! servers need upkeep, designers need to feed themselves and coders need their coffee people.free to play models are essentially an involved extended demo these days imho, and if you like it, buy it!",1

3160,"- world of oneshots- lots of grind- lack of skill balance, lvl noob plays against lvl pro- game has like modes on maps (there are more maps but you almost always will be playing on the same ones)- repetitive gameplay- you have to put vehicles in slots before you know which gamemode you will be playing. set the bombers in all slots and watch the game throwing you on a map without ground targets- you can't collect international team of your favorite warmachines. everything is divided into nations and unlocking everything in every nation takes an eternity or lots of money. i thought this game was about military vehicles not about nations- you can't even try the vehicles you haven't unlocked yet, even in the singleplayer maps. you can try the next one to unlock, but you can't try rank if you are on rank - the game is years old and there are no descriptions to a lot of vehicles yet- cheaters (the devs say there are no cheaters but you can google cheats for warthunder videos and find out yourself :))this game is really fun when you are just starting out, when everything is new and unlocks fast, and i had a lot of fun playing the first few ranks with friends. but then it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. vehicles take ages to unlock, you are playing the same modes on the same maps, and it takes way too much time (and luck) to master your skill. i would recomend trying it since its free, but don't expect too much from it.",0

15383,"this game is ok, but the pay to win by cheat rerolling makes this game complete garbage. i am convinced that even in offline play that the system is not rng, but rather forces you to land on expensive income spots so that you will pay gold to reroll. i also think this game would be much better if the starting money was higher, possibly in the realm of or million dollars. the fact that you have to go around the board multiple times in order to have the equity to start acquiring properties and building them up is obnoxious. for example, tokyo is almost always ignored completely. this game suffers from the same kinds of downfalls that monopoly does as well. for example, since a majority of the time is spent on the top corner of the board, and since dice roll 's more on average (if it is based on true rng), those who acquire cities like hamborg, london, chicago, new york, and las vegas first will always have an economic advantage. since these cities are also weighted so much for income, it makes it a terrible rush to get these properties first. also, the fact i can't sell my cities off to upgrade other cities when i land on them because i don't have the equity makes the strategy in this game dull. all in all, i do like the concepts in this game and the different win conditions, but the horrible implementation of it and the pay to win aspect make this game complete garbage. it's not even worth downloading. go play monopoly, you'll be much happier. this is just another game that will try to suck your wallet dry by nickle and diming you with microtransactions to win.",0
8130,"graphics are good, to me at least there's no fps drop between max graphics and lowest, i think theyre quite good really, i haven't seen much better in other mmos.gameplay is fun, if you like hack and slash you'll like this. you can have powers, really strong powers that you need to charge, and class features at a time in your rotation.voice acting in the game is alright compared to most i've seen in online games, might be a big plus if you don't like reading a lot of text.quests are meh, get sent to this area, get lots of quests from the people, kill this and that, go to that dungeon, then report back to the main city and get sent to another area.however i do enjoy the campaigns, which have greatly improved lore in my opinion. if you're a d&d fan you'll appreciate it more as you actually get some lore notes as you play.in game store is the most expensive i've seen in a while, you'd have to spend some crazy money to buy a good mount and a companion. i will admit i spent dollars so i could get some stuff. however, the game has an auction house where you can get highest tier companions and mounts with astral diamonds, which you can get doing some daily quests and such. it might seem really expensive and time consuming, but it's not that bad. also you can buy the zen and exchange it for diamonds, which can get you a crazy amount of diamonds so you can buy what you want from the auction house. i wouldn't recommend spending money in this game until you're maxed out and completed all campaigns. only then should you start worrying about actually having high level enchantments and stuff. by that point you might even have to afford such things with the astral diamonds you'll probably amass. (it took me about a week after i hit lvl to buy an epic set of gear)i see some people complaining about inventory space? since i started playing i've never had problems with inventory management, i don't think i'll ever buy more spacei read thru the bad reviews and they're all about the same things, how expensive things are in the game and i couldn't agree more. but honestly no one is telling you to spend money on it, you can get it all for free by simply farming. oh you can't handle playing a game for months? why play mmos then? i been playing games like runescape since they came out, i played warframe since early betas, same with path of exile and other mmos.this game is fine, has it's flaws but most of the bad reviews are exaggerated. i hit the level cap a while ago and thru ingame farming, i have some of the best gear and weapons, along with those oh so expensive enchantments and what not which only took me about a weeks. people don't realize that all mmos take time and effort to be good at, so what if it takes a year to be amazing at this game? i play many mmos and there's nothing about this game making it pay to win to the max. only an idiot would pay to win, as you can see how crazy expensive things are. most people you'll see with really good gear didn't pay to win, they simply been playing since ? if you're getting destroyed in pvp it doesn't mean they paid to win, they just been playing way longer than you (it takes about a week to hit lvl if you play everyday.)overall, i would say this isn't the most friendly game to new mmo players, but i say its definitely worth playing. it may be a long run, but eventually you'll be one of those guys destroying newbies in pvp. if anything, play with a friend it makes the game much better, i never get bored playing with my friends.",1

2017,"stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. path of exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. no pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. path of exile was meant to be the diablo successor that i've always dreamed of... but is it?the first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. the character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true diablo formula. there's plenty of strategy to implement here. i thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.but where did it all go wrong?the second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. cruel difficulty is terribly unbalanced. you will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. regardless of how you die, you will lose % of your experience on this difficulty. this function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. diablo did this, except the game is years old, and years is enough time for game developers to realize yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience. grinding gear games didn't get the memo, it seems. regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and cruel penalties. my desire to play was crushed once i was met with this awful formula. as an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by %, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.due to this massive difficulty boost, you require a build to survive. there is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional mmo). it essentially becomes a game like dark souls - a game for masochists. a game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. to even scrape by.these are the reasons why i do not recommend this game. the beginning showed lots of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. there's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the dark souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.thankfully, i didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. i hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0

17465,"note: this is an updated review. i had taken down my previous not recommended one a while back. i have such a severe love/hate relationship with this game, but this one will remain.i have been with this franchise since . hours played on here is so far off due to playing for so many years off of steam. with my love of the franchise, you won't get a biased review here. in fact, i don't even always know why i recommend this game. and yes, i know how commentors work, if i have this many hours in a game, how can it not be recommended? quite frankly because this is not the same game i used to play all those hours. this is an mmo, and mmos change. but, i recommend this game, to an extent.the beginning and first few expansions are great. but then, i think there is only word to describe how the game becomes: bloated. they seem to add more features for advancement, than actual content. sometimes it feels as if they are trying to give the illusion that there is more content than their really is. kunark ascending tried doing that with the epic . weapons. you will be doing more in older content, than current content, to gain that weapon. and i am talking content that is much lower than you. i don't mind working for a weapon that is the best in slot for -ish years, but their wasn't much in the way of new content to do.i know i don't speak for everyone, but i feel this is a game that only gets worse if you rush it. there are over , quests in this game, but expansions only add in the double digits these days. if you are a quester, if you want to adventure, i can only recommend this game if you don't rush, because once you get to the end game, you will see many illusions of content.so why recommend this game? the content that is there, is fairly good. it sucks that it ends so quickly at end game, but the grind will at least be real if you want that. but i mainly recommend the start and the first few expansions. after that, it just gets bloated. but some people do enjoy that.this is just my cents, i don't expect everyone to agree with me. but you can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours out of this game on character, and not be able to do everything, unless you rush and only focus on the last couple expansions. but, grinders can get those hours. i am just speaking of unique content. not repeats.",1

8162,"i would say first, it is really an action game using rpg elements more than an actual rpg. while you do have the ability to customize your characters stats and abilities and you do take quests, there is really only one way to complete quests, which is to kill everything between you and the quest marker and then talk to whoever is waiting for you at the end. further, even though this character is a rogue, i don't pick locks or pockets. i can disable traps, but in a group everyone runs through the dungeon so quickly there is no point in trying to disable anything.that said, the combat is pretty fun and action packed. i tried the pvp arena for the first time yesterday and had a blast. and then there is the foundry. the foundry allows players to create their own adventures that other people can then go through. i've tried a few and they seem to be pretty creative and fun (my earlier screenshots with the dancing skeletons and the upside down world were from two different foundry quests.) once you are done with a foundry quest you can then rate it for others.overall i would say the game is pretty good, i have been having enough fun to keep going back",1

9498,"the best thing about this mmo is that you can totally ignore other people and play it as a single-player game. this may also be it's greatest drawback, as there seem to be few opportunities for the social interactions that give other mmos a sense of story and belonging. the most stand-out feature of realm of the mad god is it's perma-death system, but once you get deeper into it, it turns out that it doesn't actually have perma-death. rather than building up the character you are playing as, realm of the mad god is actually about leveling up the little pokemon who follow you around.the really good pokemon (pets whatever. we know they're all actually pokemon) are the ones that heal you, and the best class to play as would be the necromancer, whose attacks not only effectively damage enemies but also effectively heal your character. once having unlocked the necromancer, why would anyone play rotg as any other class? rotg's class system suffers from the same problem as final fantasy v's job system: there are a few kickass jobs you max out before too long, and then a whole bunch of useless jobs you don't really need to bother with because what they offer is either too similar to what you've already got or else so specialized that they can rarely be utilized effectively.anyway, i can't recommend this as an mmorpg. but i can recommend it as a casual game. if you've got an audiobook to get through and want something mindless to grind away at while listening then realm of the mad god is the perfect mmorpg for you. just ignore other players, get some healing pokemon and be a necromancer.",1

6768,"as of currently, i can not say i like what i see. even for a beta, this game is quite broken. though gameplay is the only one that isn't broken to my knowledge, but it's the loading, the buffering, the waiting, it's too long. i mean, i expected this to be basically planetside but in a wwii era, instead i get a battlefield free to play. though i'm not arguing on that subject, i actually don't mind in the slightest. but the fact that i had to wait nearly minutes just to get to the main menu and an additional minutes to get into a game, i rather just update planetside and play that. and after the game was done, i got to the point where i could unlock / buy weapons, and that broken too, everytime i buy a weapon it doesn't respond, i keep clicking and i never unlock the weapon. again, i can reason it being a beta, i should expect some issues, but this has been out since july and it's nearing the end of august, i think there should of been plenty of time for this to not be an issue for future players like me. i want to enjoy this game, but with the waiting and the non-response of the menu, i can't exactly say i'm impressed nor makes me want to come back. what's the point in waiting nearly half an hour to play one game when there are other games like it that are not only polished but finished to where it can take me just mere seconds to play a game. maybe when it's officially released i may come back to see if it's been improved, but after tonight, i'm more likely not coming back.",0

3978,"team fortress is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with classes that all have unique personalities. each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.the heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. the soldier shoots rockets, has the nd most health and and is the nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. the demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. the pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. the spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. his sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. the scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. snipers snipe from far away. medics heal and make people invincible at times. as for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. the more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. if a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. it is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. there is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points ( or points instead of just like king of the hill). teams for both modes are mostly vs . each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.the newest mode is mann vs machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. there is a free version of mann vs machine called boot camp and a non free version called mann up that costs a tour of duty ticket ($ in the store). the ticket gets used if you complete a mvm mission. if you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. a mann vs machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. what do you get for completing a tour? a random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!the maps in team fortress stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. there is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! hats for $, keys for $.. keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! there is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. the game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. weapons will make you a refined metal. that's the basic free currency of the game. when you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $.. you can also buy and sell keys in the steam market for steam wallet money to buy steam games.the items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. so it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. it is all rock-paper-scissors. heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. a pyro can easily take out a spy. stuff like that.team fortress is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and halloween events. the halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just halloween versions of normal maps. the community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. there have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.it is an exceptional game. diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!! free!!! you get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. it is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! or single player against bots! it is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. the game is smooth, the characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. there is a diverse array of modes.",1

14976,"with recent updates, robocraft has died. the main reason people loved it was because of the creativity it allowed to thrive. the ability to create wonderous designs after constant tweaking, spending hours creating a perfect machine of both functionality and style, and finally testing it in battle against countless others who had done the same. seeing bits of your robo getting blasted off, yet feeling relief that the cleverness of your design allows you to continue the fight without the missing pieces. having your entire robot being destoryed in a death match, yet being able to rejoin the fight thanks to a repairbot and the built-in escape pod that you spent weeks perfecting.it is all gone now.in its place, we have a ruined husk that is more akin to a facebook game than the glory of what it used to be. the game is now entirely around trying to drain its players of as much money as possible. you don't get the feeling of progress after every match like you used to, instead, you can't move forward at all without shilling out insane amounts of money. you can forget about using the ingame currency to buy the parts you needed, that isn't an option anymore. instead, even with money, they put a worthless crate system where you have to gamble for that final part needed to build the masterpiece you envisioned.",0
15721,"at first glance, one might find aqd to be a pretty basic, not-so-difficult hack and slash mmo. but this game, in my opinion, does so much more than just appeal to longtime artix entertainment fans. honestly, it, in a way, is revolutionary (hear me out). not only is ae tapping into the cross-class playtype (which i haven't seen in almost any games), they're making a game that doesn't just hand you everything you want. the first few levels go by no problem, and you're appropriately geared. however as the game starts to veer towards dungeon-crawling and actual grinding, one finds themselves actually having to work for items. to be properly geared heading into a new zone or just for new dungeon content, you actually have to work. this involves not only fighting zone bosses for items to craft better gear, it also incorperates working through dungeons with other players for the same reasons. if that's not enough, ae is a company that will listen to fan input (amazing, isn't it?). the content creators constantly interact with fans. there's transparency from the staff on upcoming updates and issues they're working to solve. as far as bugs, this game is in beta. those of us playing are here to help sort out the bugs and get the game ready for final release. that being said it is already a pretty complete game with tons of fun content and many planned seasonal events (including one going on at the time of this review being written). i recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun, immersive cross-platform experience.",1

(possibly due to the fact that my 'hero' refuses to pull prophecy cards when his runes are broken, and in stead, pulls them on his turn, making them less effective or fun to use, while my opponent seems to have none of these issues, but that's rng, i guess..).as the game hardly brings something new to the table, i don't see it competing with hearthstone, and with gwent's release closing in, i have a feeling legends won't be around very long.",0

3366,"already put hours into this game and i say for sure that i enjoy this a lot more than pubg. it has an interesting and unique spin on the br genre which is greatly appreciated in this market of pubg clones. optimization could use some work but it's early access so i'm sure the devs already plan to work on that (game runs decently actually but it could run better). i have a ton of fun with my friends in squads and duos; solo is fun as well. really unique gameplay aspects that differentiate this from other brs like the zone system, how you drop into the map, the different loadouts you can start with; really shake things up. the inventory and equipment system is leagues ahead of pubg, for example you've got auto equip for attachments, when swapping to guns it will swap the attachemnts too, when you drop a gun it will put the attachments in your inventory for you, can have sights/scopes set to one gun and toggle between the without ever needing to open your inventory. i definitely recommend this to anyone who regrets their $ spent on pubg (me oof) or those of you who have been waiting for a cheaper or free alternative to that game. some of the unique things about roe:-you can choose exactly where on the map to spawn-you can choose from preset loadouts (skiing pack, climbing pack, and gliding pack)skiing pack gives you the ability to deploy a snowboard and quickly travel through the snowy envionrment without needing a vehicle. climbing allows you to use the miles of ziplines around the map to travel fast and get to places that most others can't, you can also climb up certain rock faces to gain advantageous and strategic postions. the gliding pack allows you to use a hang glider whenever you're in the air, you can hang glide of a mountainrs, cliffs, buildings, or ledges to flank or surpise your opponents.-the zone system is super unique, it'll be confusing at first and seem like the zone mvoes waaay too fast but once you understand how it works then you won't die to zone often or even at all. and part of that is due to all the different forms of transportation you're offered-freaking ski lifts!!!-extraction helicopter, allows up to different teams to get the win-haven't encountered any bugs or gltichesroe: ./ (would be a but i'm just gonna take off . for any issues/bugs i haven't yet encountered but might exist)",1

2966,"absolutely not worth your time, i promise you. the game is made so that you will be outgunned / games and you roam from match to match losing all your tanks immediately.the shell hasnt done any damage voice line will be burned into your ing brain.from my experience i feel as if the game is purposefully gimping you (with the already dice rolls, this game heavily relies on luck).the game is based around a br system x. x. x. (. . .) and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down point of br which is ing broken most of the time. i'd like to see tanks around my level or one above/below mine. instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are whole br above you, meaning your best tank is worthless. if your best tank is worthless, all the ones below it are useless. the second i researched a tank past . (.) i immediately saw an insane rise in my br (battle rating) versus everyone else. once in a blue moon i can penetrate the tanks i find, otherwise i am either getting ed by enemy armor or my own team not defending a point. i went from getting - kills a match to getting maybe or . sometimes .this is not a matter of skill because i can outflank the enemy team like a ing mythical norse god and still be useless because i put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank, while this guys brigade of super heavy . tanks turn around andall over me. i cant count the number of times i've seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map, mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through ing trees.arcade is ing useless, it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by . if there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank, you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game. the second your name pops up tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn heat shell with the accuracy gungnir. if you even attempt realistic without hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier. if you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every ing aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you, robbing you any chance of having fun.so they almost have a good game here. but they wont fix the dice rolling, they wont fix thematchmaking range, they wont fixto make a good game. i dont mind the grind at all (which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers). they wont because it heavily insentivizes people to get premium and buy their way through the grind, in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their mm wand. it is such an incredibly fustrating and unrewarding experience once they've roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that / game is not worth it. i rarely got matched with high br until i really got into the game. dont even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single ing stray bullet.i would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging they've got going on.edit: tanks (and aircraft) are also seperated in ranks. these ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about .-. in br; although the ranges vary based on the nations you play. my point being is % of the tanks in france rank are unplayable and i am not exaggerating in the slightest. to compare, the worst i did with a tank in rank (germany/usa) in war thunder was something like spawns and kills. i never had more deaths than kills in war thunder until i tried the french. the french are so bad i had a tank with spawns and kills. another tank with spawns and kills. one tank with spawns and kill. the only only time i could get kills was pure and absolute luck with finishing off someone elses target while i hit weak spots in the back, which sometimes took many shells. or shooting a notoriously terribly armored tank (bt-). it was baffling how these tanks were incapable of penetrating even the worst of tanks. non of the starting tanks would yield their sweet death to me, including the japanese. even when i managed to penetrate, the amount of time it took me to lob - shells into a single tank, only gave teamates enough time to finish them off just because you couldnt finish off their crew. i'm sure if you google french rank tanks you will see everyone agrees.",0

9300,"planetside is a tough one to sum up. first off, you need a decent computer to run this because this game will kill you computer if it can't handle it. it is a very cpu and gpu heavy game. aside from that, it is a joy to play. unlike your typical shooter, this game does not revolve around quickscoping and lone wolfing. if you do that in this game, it will be a bad expeirience as you constantly die. but it is not meant to be played this way. a game like this needs real co-ordination with you squad and your outfit. you must know what you are doing in this game. thats is crutial, because this is a massive game with over people per server. every team needs to co-ordinate. the pay to win model is non-existant in this game. you can play without spending a dime and still kill players who throw down $ a month for premium membership. as for bugs, yes there are plenty of bugs, but soe is updating this game every month, they constantly look at what is wrong so far and try to fix it. planetside has the potential to be the top game for the next year or so. since its free, there is no reason why you should't try it.note: if you are planning to play this game with a medium to low end computer, i recommend putting the graphics to low, and the render quality to % to maximize the frames per second.",1

6461,"take this into considerations before you even put any time into this game; it's reviews are mixed. if that isnt enough to turn you away from this game, than i'll delve deeper.the trailers are the greatest part of this game, it makes up for the game's lack of in-game music. grinding takes forever in terms of exp to earn your next weapon, and credits to buy your next weapon.this game is pay to lazy, not pay to win. everything in the game can be unlocked with in-game currency without ever having put a penny into it. however, these pay to lazy prices are absurd, ranging in the s.the community is absolutely horrendus. alongside the forums, there has had to be major censoring on all three factions, in the game. you will see a lack of sportsmanship.due to the game's lack of combined arms, you'll be out of luck if you thought this game would be where you can renact your favorite fury scene where brad pitt fires an stg. at a german from an mae sherman. you will never be able to spawn with a mosin nagant as a german or vice versa.the developers take years to respond to certain kinds of feedback, reto displays heavy examples of selective listening where certain factions recieve more or less attention due to their paying playerbase. it has taken years for a glitch in plane dogfighting in which one pilot could instant-kill the other without damaging their plane.i will probably be banned if the reto community manager sees this. because like many others, people have been banned for giving this game a review it truly deserves. however, i'm fine with this. the heroes and generals that i started playing two years ago has radically changed. and will continue to change.if you still decide to play this game. you'll have a fun hours before you realize the heavy gripes of this game.",0

6516,"written by maxtunnerx - has been removed from the official forums;shortened point due to char limit___this is a list of reto's policies that negatively influence game development and public opinion:) implement first, ask questions laterwhenever something game changing is about to get in game, nothing can stop it. at the very best, devs make a public test server available - days before launch without reflecting complaints. this results in unfinished and disliked features in game which take months to tweak in the actual game! if the feature needs so many tweaks to be working properly, roll back the live servers and do the tweaks on a separate (preferably public) server, dont punish your regular players.) polls and silent majoritydevs dont consider forum polls representative no matter how many votes there are just because its a fraction of the playerbase voting. they also refuse to solve their percieved lack of representativeness by implementing in game polls because they dont want polls. nextly, they take silence as agreement, which is wrong. silence is neutral, its not agreement nor disagreement. they keep referring to vocal minority and silent majority as if these were constant values. they somehow dont understand that if they implement something vocal minority wants and silent majority doesnt, the silent majority will become vocal majority and devs will see what the opinion in the community really is and can roll the change back.) adding everything into the pipeline no matter how urgent it ishaving trouble with constant eye strain and very limited visibility, both of which are getting worse by the build and both of which can be easily fixed by rolling back/editing a few values? no problem, we will put it into pipeline and maybe in years you will have a fix...) doing everything the most difficult way, over-complicating and over-doing thingslet me demonstrate this on examples:a) spawncamping/mining - instead of editing a few lines in game rules (prohibiting this behavior) or using the vehicle ghost mode system that they developed for skirmish battles, devs decided to fix spawncamping by working on a set of requirements all new maps must meet to (probably) prevent spawncamping. needless to say that its more difficult to make maps because of it.b) teamwork/special at limits - instead of using special at limits like in the past (for example tanks per battle max) and instead of using already working squad system, they decided to make a whole new system and connect everything (related or not) to it. that took about % of human resources (including those from rts department) and several months to make. the result is a half-finished system that will take weeks or months to tweak (finish).) being stubborn about good and neccessary featuresthe biggest example is class tutorials. there is absolutely positively no reason not to implement tutorials for all classes. in fact, its the other way around as the benefit is huge (skilled heroes and happy generals). despite that, devs are stubborn and refuse to make tutorials saying we would have to update them all the time. that is a very lame reason at best as first blood was updated like once or twice so far. besides, the important thing about tutorials is teaching the basics. players dont have to have all new equipment and stuff there, they just need thing the tutorial is about (pilots need just plane, tankers need tank etc., they dont need of them to choose from), so except for gameplay and similar changes (which are very rare), there wont be any reason to update the tutorials.) preventing community from helpingdue to the slow game development, its obvious community wants to help. however, devs decided to make their own engine and use various incompatible programs to prevent any such help. danish laws also complicate the matter, but i would be very surprised if there wasnt a legal way to bypass it. whats missing is the will to look for such a way.) adding stuff nobody needsshining example be the tractors, especially in combination with the announced trucks. of course its nice to have more variety in game, but is it useful? is it useful so much that it overrides all other priorities and makes it into the game before other features (*cough* planes *cough* bipods)? these questions probably werent asked by devs before implementing tractors. worse yet, in the next build they will add another batch of useless transport vehicles to the game.seriously, is it really that important to have vehicles in the same category, when the new vehicle is even worse deathtrap than the predecessor? especially when the existing vehicles could already do everything these new vehicles can do and sometimes even better? hell, there are finished mortars but noone has the time to think of a fun way to implement them. no wonder when all time is spent on this stuff.) removing stuff that was/would be cool, decreasing quality of some featuressometimes the devs lose the way and sabotage their own game. how else could you explain them removing compass, pistol drive-by in cars, plane vs train missions, old soldier interface (+ one primary, one secondy etc. weapon limit), skirmish trench map and downgrading graphics and vehicle skins? if youre curious, check pre-alpha, alpha, and beta videologs and you will see. if you want to have a good laugh, i recommend watching a pre-alpha videolog where they say it is far from final and will improve over time and then watch a beta videolog where everything is worse.) broken faction pipelinethis is something my brain isnt able to comprehend. why on earth do they release a new item for one or two factions only and leave the other faction(s) waiting for months before they get their counterpart? this is unheard of and every time i think about it im like jackie chan in that i dont even... meme.) selfishness and lies, king and peasant attitudeits not a bad thing to develop a game the way you want without asking anyone for opinion. however, it is very dishonest to say user driven development and help us make the game you want to play and then ignore user input and make a game you (devs) want to play. by the way guys, have the devs ever implemented something you suggested? its not very likely, but it is possible. however, dont think they did it for you. they most likely implemented your suggestion only because they had it in the pipeline long before you asked for it, and now the time has come to implement it.panther was a good example. people requested panther a lot, so devs waited until the time they had planned to release it, released it and community was happy they got something they wanted. nobody quite realised that panther was first asked for like + years ago, and was asked for a lot about a year before implementation.that brings us back to game devs want to play. you see, they consider themselves king of the game and consider community the peasants. in other words, players are supposed to shut up and play at all times. there is a rare occasion when the king listens to a peasant, and that is when a player comes up with something super cool the devs havent thought of. now you get the idea why they dont want polls and instead want constructive feedback (thats the peasant's surprisingly good idea).in the very ideal case when they confirm an issue and decide to do something about it (which takes months and hundreds of topics), all they do is put it at the end of their damn pipeline...!) fixing whats not broken, not fixing what is brokenyeah, thats how they do. when something works perfectly, they fix it and create bugs. when there is something actually broken, nothing is done about it for years.",0

10970,"don't expect any enjoyable pve after the first few hours. you rank up quickly and then the ai's flawless card drawing advantage ruins your games and can deplete your coins.problem : cpu draw vs. your drawthe mana mechanic in eternal works like magic tg. there are land/mana cards called sigils which cumulatively power your other cards each turn, and getting the right balance of mana is essential. that's no problem except that in eternal, the ai consistently (very infuriatingly consistent) gets a perfect balance of mana (sigils) vs. the other card types for smooth gameplay. you, on the other hand, will contrast this by getting random draws, and you will consistently lack sigils. occasionally you will be overloaded with sigils instead, which is just as bad. you may have the better deck, but it often doesn't help because the ai has a guaranteed draw every time. this is especially problematic since pve rewards require consecutive victories.i can't remember any other ccg working like this. it seems the ai was intentionally programmed this way, perhaps to lure you into spending $$$ on better cards, to overcome this unreasonable advantage. (it doesn't seem to happen in the bronze and silver leagues but you level out of those in a few hours.)problem : deck sizethe minimum deck size is , process that. (it's actually , but that doesn't include sigils, which are added automatically, and bring the total to about .) what?? this means you can't play themed decks very well at all. do you have a good idea for a deck, with clever card combos and synergies? it will be too difficult to play it because it's too difficult to draw the right cards.problem : gauntletas you progress through the gauntlet, you eventually reach master league. nevermind the fact that each league is progressively harder yet the rewards stay the same, there is actually no special reward for a successful master gauntlet run; just the same silver chest you get for minor accomplishments. in fact, even beating the lesser leagues yields a better reward. the highest pve achievement in the game has no special reward, and it doesn't take long to advance and be stuck in that league. (assuming you have the patience to deal with aggravating mechanics to get there in the first place.)problem : campaignthe main campaign is incredibly short and you will be finished it in a few hours. the second campaign costs quite a bit, and i still do not have enough saved despite having completed the highest level gauntlet. (~ hours in)problem : forgefun at first, but quickly becomes just another way to lose gold. thanks to the sigil problem detailed above, you just throw away your precious gold entry fee after reaching the gold/diamond+ league. you need multiple consecutive wins to make this worth it, but that becomes very difficult when the game is withholding sigils. this one is the nail in the coffin for pve. at least the gauntlet, while frustrating, is free. gold is just too scarce to justify the high cost and risk of advanced forge runs.conclusioneither stick to pvp only, or uninstall and save yourself the trouble; or at least wait for updates to the problems above. maddening design choices ruin pve fun after you level out of the beginner leagues./ sigils.",0

13567,"i've never played minecraft before, but when my wife picked up this game during it's free week, i decided i would check it out as well. it is absolutely fantastic. i played it for about a day and a half before i decided to pay for it, and i don't even slightly regret the choice. it's still early access, and it occasionally shows, but this game shows an extremely high level of polish that i've not seen on some games that are even fully released. the bugs that i've come across are usually small, but pretty regularly re-creatable. however the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook. my biggest problem is with the combat, honestly. it's almost always a battle of attrition, and if you survive, you tend to end up with low health. at that point it's almost better to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your things. dying is basically a part of the game, so it's good that there's no real repercussions for doing so (other than having to go pick up the things in your bag). some creatures are absurdly difficult, and dodging is almost a complete non-factor. you can, occasionally, find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit, but it's inconsisitent.my nd largest issue is the durability of some items in the game compared to the amount of materials required to craft them. the mining cells in particular come to mind. there's one of two ways to solve this as far as i can see: either make items with durability (like mining cells) last a lot longer, or make the odd materials to make them more readily available. i'm not saying i want my stone mining cell to last me through hours of playtime, but i would like to be able to find red flowers without running around for minutes looking at every other tree i find.in spite of this, the game is immensely fun, and you can easily find yourself sucked into it. digging into your mine deeper, crafting your house to look absurdly awesome, or just exploring the surprisingly vast environments, you'll find yourself readily wondering where the hours have gone. i'd definitely give this game a /, because it's technically not even finished yet. you should definitely check it out.",1

(if you can call it like that).it is fun at the beginning when you can unlock new cards and experiment with them, but in the end this game turns out to be unbalanced and only few cards are playable, seeing the same decks and the mindlessly auto include op cards over and over again. really boring and no strategic at all.- super random effects everywhere in prophecies, abilities, spells. gambling at its best form.- no counter tactics.- no interaction in your opponents turn.- no color/attribute theme and special character. they are all a big mixed salad. red or strenght cards have more draw card mechanics than blue or else intelligence cards. that makes sence to you right? check another exp. you have this special double attribute card and then you have those single attribute strength cards that do the same thing but also they are creatures being also a threat in the board and if this isn't a sloppy card desing what is?conclusion attributes mean they are more to resemble/copy mtg colors, without having their own special tricks and abilities.- a lot of broken cards with wrong mana/energy cost. (exp. vs they have same cost and obviously you run them all in a control deck but the first is times better, it exiles from the board and the deck in the same cost!! super deal!! no backfire!! exellent job!!).if you are into strategic card games go play magic arena that will be coming out soon and it will be also free to play.if you are autistic with no social skills and critical thinking continue to play this braindead game. better for us.",0

6320,"product received for freeearly access reviewthis game, has potential. this can be a fun game. and i hope, that this game is fun when it is finished. but, the beta lacks balance. in the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. that is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. some may say,oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon. i would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. the first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. to hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then. i haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. most of the maps, i've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. only five to be exact. however, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective. the lack of progress is irratating. because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. after about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. you then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. plus, the first american smg is significantly better than the german counterpart because of its lack of recoil. after almost twelve hours pf gameplay, i still can't afford the smg, i'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and i'm frankly at wits end. i will say that at first it was fun, but now i find myself getting annoyed. i am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like i haven't made any progress. i think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. if you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. but their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.",0
3633,"i got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money, and i have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase. over hours over a span of years i've played this game and watched it grow, add new things. i was there from the hatless update april , up to the smissmas update. the game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decissions i wasn't very fond of. if its something valve are masters on it is to build a game that's all about the gameplay. its by their flawless designs that their games like left dead, counter-strike and team fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day, despite some of them being decades old. looking at team fortress it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games, especially when saw a surge of other class-based arena shooters like overwatch and battleborne (haha) i will say i played overwatch for about a year, it was the christmas of when i first got overwatch and at the start, i enjoyed it. but over the year i played it the sessions when i played it grew further and further appart, until i only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didn't touch the game. it was then i really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game, how it had been polished to perfection. something as simple as the loadouts, simple change of weapons could completely alter the playstyle of characters in this game, swap the engineer's wrench out for a gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the offensive rather than defensive. the medic's main weapon, syringe gun vs blutsauger changes whether he's a battle medic or not. the syringegun allows you a passive health regen of hp but blutsauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regen by points, making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive, and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regen after escaping close encounters.that's only examples of ways classes can change depending on their loadout. every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their loadout. in games like overwatch your hero has counters, meaning you can't master a class to the point where you're unbeatable because he's been designed around a rock-paper-scissors design to where some hero can take you out. in this game it was just about picking a class, selecting a loadout that suits your playstyle and going to town. there was very little counters, each class could take out the other equaly so long as you played it right. (with class exception..) the community also helped make this game great, by offering custom game modes, custom maps, custom servers. it was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it, allowed the community to create and take part in it. something overwatch doesn't allow past letting them design skins.. what has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that i feel it has lost its way. many of the people i used to play with have moved on and the community isn't the same as it once was. the community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are minecraft servers with ads out the a*s to try and cash in ad revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favorite game. that's not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community, the dev team has plenty to do in it as well. trying to make the weapons balanced, the team went back and fourth with alot of the weapons in the game, improving some that were before worthless (like the quick fix) and but turning some before good weapons, bad. the problem is that when listening to a community, you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt. keep in mind, its not the people using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced, its the people getting killed by them that's complaining. much like how cod nerfed its shotguns down to being useless, the game killed alot of good weapons and ruined some peoples' loadout. but it wasn't also loadout changes, adding things like competitive play to the game, i still feel was one of the worst decissions ever. the games random crits system, is there for a reason. its there as a boost of luck, so that even if you're better than everyone else, you might have a critical rocket strike you, or a critical heavy or scout which you would've otherwise escaped from or defeated. could you imagine if cs:go had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg it'd count as a crit and kill the person? the community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and insta-kill the person they were shooting at. i no longer play team fortress , because the state its in is not one i like. i have played it a bit in recent times, but that was doing tour of duty with some friends, as mann vs machine is a gamemode i still enjoy. but even if i no longer play it, i will never forget the friends i made through it, i won't forget the trading i did through it, i won't forget the fun times i had on it. hours, amounting to more than half a year. some would call that a waste, but i wouldn't have traded those hours for anything. thank you for the memories team fortress .",1

(however it does go down quite often which is unfortunate)pvp - *sigh* this is the most damaging aspect of the game. it has the potential to be great but anyone who plays who has not sunked k real money into will admit - is broken unbalanced and pure pw. literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change. unless pvp is fixed the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it is already and continue until gone. but in overall opinion it is a fair fp game but has the potential to be one of the best if handled better.",1

14603,"note: while most of my gameplay hours come from way back, this review is about the current state of the game, not about what it used to be.in short: robocraft is a game, which allows considerable freedom to build creative bots and then battle it out. it's also a game which doesn't really allow much creativity if you want to be competetive. the autobalance is bad and new small bots will be matched against massive leviathans with more guns than you own. progression tied to loot boxes (think battlefront ).good sides:- lots of tools and parts to build exactly what you want,- many maps,- detailed info about your bot allows for easy planning,- supports many control schemes,- simple pre-made start for new players,- leaving cpu unused gives damage boost, but...bad sides:- ...large bots with many guns get a health boost,- all progression tied to random loot crates/luck,- matchmaking, small bots matched with ones x the cpu,- no proper feeling of progression, just random,- only gamemodes (with respawn) available. gets repetetive,overall, robocraft is a game which has many interesting systems, but which also doesn't support creating with them. while devs have made this game more accessible, they've also cut away so much. bad matchmaking ensures you'll have a hard time unless you get lucky or pay up for the loot crates. locking progression behind random chance is just the last straw.i cannot recommend this game.",0

10130,"thehunter, why i enjoy this game.- for everybody who appreciates realism, i belive this one is as close as it gets.- a very mature community (usually older people who have the patientce to hunt, yes less than in real life but still this game requires patience to bring home those beautiful animal trophies).- the game is constantly updated and it keeps a very strong data base tracking every animal you hunted/spotted, every shot fired with each weapon so you can see how you are doing comparing to others not to mention that daily there are competitions with trophies and prizes.- beautiful graphics and sounds (especially when maxing graphics), makes you really feel like hiking in the wild.i would like to say a few words about why this game is unjustifiably trashed on steam.- notice, that absolutly .% of all negative reviews are by people who barely played and just seem not to understand the bussiness model, no single negative comment is actually made about the game it self.- the bussiness model of this game is different and it requires understanding.bussiness model:- as a free to play what you get is a limited experience of being able to visit all the maps but to hunt only species (mule deer, cottontail rabbit). clearly this will not last you for hundreds of hours but you must consider this as a - hours of demo that will show you wether you would like the game or not.- thehunter is constantly being updated (its the same game from ) so the bussiness model here is a subscription bussiness model. in reallity depending on the time you commit to - monthes you can pay as little as $ for a month ($ per year).- the items/ gear that is sold in thehunter is also sold for real money, you must consider this as dlcs (steam languge).- even if you absolutly want to a lot of new content yearly it shouldnt cost you more than $ per year.in case you are intrested in trying:- just download the game.- tune up graphics in settings to max (relative to your rig ofc.)- start and finish the tutorial.- start / join a hunt in logger's point and go on tracking and hunting mule deers and cottontail rabbits- after a few hours you will see if the game is for you ;)",1

1938,"dota is a first person mmo rpg survival horror game developed by ea and ea only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.the main protagonist is you, jakob. you are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. jakob's model really matches his personality. a hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of morgan freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.the storyline is great. i love how the developers have a completely separate prologue chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first minutes of the game). you start out in the middle of россия... er, russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, really attracted to your cousin. you take her out to show her the world when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. your cousin falls into the crevice. you are devastated. you try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. you look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. you then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. and i'll stop there, otherwise i may end up spoiling the prologue!the pvp in this game is spot on. it's like the developers know that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! it's brilliant, need i say more? fine, i shall! just like the amazingness that was dungeon keeper mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into ea's pockets! it's fantastic!the best part too? it's бесплатно--free. если вы грязная американская свинья, кто не любит водку, то вы позор. um, what i meant to say was it doesn't even cost a dime!overall i would say this game is a /, a must-have game. ea has really shown how to create such a game. i'm just waiting on the dlc to come out later since, surprisingly, there was no day-one dlc.",1

14784,"god damn, have the mighty have fallen. i had started this game around december of , and it seemed interesting. the previous year came and gone without much issues with the updates... but then this year rolled around. and it looks like the game is under new manegement. i did not mind the removal of tech points, nor the addition of new weapons. but the straw that broke the camels back is one, important, thing. nano disruptor's loss of damage output to enemies and therefore it's fall to complete uselessness. if you can heal yourself by just waiting, why have someone on your team with just nano disruptors when you can just hide somewhere and regenerate? the addition of lock-on weapons seemed like a good idea on paper, but it makes taking them on a nightmare when you consider that the new loot system has a good probability to reward these weapons. you should never, ever, ever, have loot drops be the sole way to earn curancy and items. and more importantly, never have the rng be too damn broad with the drops, as another reviewer has pointed out, it does not matter if you bought crates, odds are that all the drops will be comon or uncomon % of the time. i had to deal with cryptarch rahool in destiny year , and he was more fair with his drops even before bungie fixed his rolls with engrams, than with this new bs loot system. and what the hell is up with the locked drops behind slots deal? we got them out of those crates, give them to us, don't you dare shove a cupcake in our face and then take it away, because we don't have the neccecary requirements, considering these items are going to be hard as hell to get now, with the new currency situation. with the drop system in place, you have to break down items, just so then you can make new ones. overall, great ing job with screwing over year long fans who enjoyed the game, and great job ing over people who would gladly give you money with this backwater, money gouging system. you suck, because you made a once good game suck. thank god for jim sterling.update (.): wow, you guys really ed it up. i came back hoping that the game might, just might, have changed for the better, but no, it got worse. first of all, i see the loot box system hasn't changed, didn't even bother giving those who suffered through the last year of thisshow a day of prenium just to earn all of the rewards, no. and while i will admit giving players almost an unlimited size (just that in order to play pvp it has to be under cpu), the fact that getting blocks to build your bot with is still a chore makes it underwhelming. and is it just me, or is the weight of your bot is put on the back left as opposed to the center, where it should be? this can't be a counter to drones, as most bots are supposed to built from the center outwards, it would make no sense to change that. also, i miss the the single-player mode where you could kill bots and get rewarded for it. what, think that people were abusing it? it's actually laughable on how, at release, it has less players then when it went to alpha. then again it has been a year and a half since i wrote this review, and you've done buggered it up some more. clearly yall are deaf to your audience, and you should be ashamed for it.",0

817,ahem ahem...if you've got plenty of time to waste(emphasis on the word waste) this is the game you would be playing. its dull with low graphics and poor sound(well its free so you cant expect much). i dont recommend you playing this game how much ever your friends tell you to.,0
4327,"its a fun addicting shorter version of yu-gi-oh tcg. you can play this game without spending a penny. but if you ever want to get to the highest rank of king of games in the rank ladder it is possible without spending money; however, it will take a lot of time and luck with the rng to pull cards necessary to be competitive. the game overall is fun since you can mess around with friends or play solo just afking while auto-dueling bots to level up your characters and gather materials to access the duel gate or card trader shop. this game revolves around gems though to get new packs, accessories, and structure decks; these gems can be obtained from leveling up, events, dueling in rank, or spending money on deals in the shop. but, recently konami has made it harder to get gems like in the past with less gems being given in events and rank as well as changing the amount of packs in the new mini-boxes from to , which makes it harder to obtain multiple copies of cards when resetting the mini-box. they also added awhile back the first structure deck only obtainable with money only not gems, so there are stuff locked behind the paywall. so, with each new box and mini-box release there are always meta defining decks along with them and its getting hard to keep up as a free-to-play player or mildy spend few cash player; so you have to save and spend gems wisely on cards you want or competitive boxes. overall if you want to reminiscent of playing yu-gi-oh like in one's childhood or play card game for fun this is a good game, but if you want to be competitive without spending money on this game from the start, it will be challenging to gather necessary cards for meta deck; unless you save up in a short period gems to get meta deck made.",1

14864,"while i dont play it much anymore, the devs are moving in a generally good direction the last time i heard of the updates. old review robocraft has, to say the least, run through some bumpy updates, whether it be including rng into the game's system (as in making you rummage through multiple loot boxes to get parts that are generally useless to someone higher than a new player), or completely remove tiers [(a system which helped balance matchmaking of bots so you wouldn't get massive bots shredding into new players like wet paper)robocraft's gamemodes go as far as this-tdm, your general gamemode in almost every combat orientated game-ba, battle arena, a mode about capturing points to mine protonium crystals to power a weapon that destroys the enemy base-brawl, a mode that is either free-for-all or tdm that has some gimmicks to it-custom games, a customizable game where you invite people in to play a game you customized- ai tdm, tdm but with robits controlling digital robits-ba ranked (or leauge), ba but for every loss you lose mmr (a value which is used to rank you in the gamemode) and for every victory you get mmr mechanics and stuff the forgethis is basically the shop where you make things using robits, the ingame currencymost things are pretty expensive and require atleast more than one game to getrecyclingyou scrap parts you get from loot boxes (gained from playing games) for robitsinventorythe menu where you can see what parts you havebuildingyou build bots and stuff, health blocks (basic cubes) give a hp boost to everything, light cubes are x the cpu cost (the value which determines how costly your bot is) and are more durable but give a x less boost in hp compared to cpu.misc notes about stuff:-parts recycle for alot less than what they cost-loot boxes have robits in them-loot box items in general are rare or below for even the best loot box, though the best one mostly has large sums of robits (mostly yeilding atleast one , and sometimes a ,) gameplay most of the time it's either you die or dont when encountering enemies, from my personal experience, after winning alot you'll experience a loss streak. alot of bots above cpu contain larger weapons that will kill you unless you have a better bottldr; game isnt that great but isnt completely unplayable, you can find some enjoyment after you get your first large weapon (excluding the protoseeker) edit: they've added robits into crates, giving somewhat of a chance to progress without mindlessly spending hours on said game, my opinion of this is still a do-not-reccomend, but it has softened.edit. from what ive seen so far with the updates, freejam has improved in how they update, although this game is flawed to say the least, it's not unbearable now.",0

13238,"fallout shelter is your usual idle mobile game with a bit of simulation and some clicking. made by bethesda and behaviour entertainment, released first in on ios and other mobile, updated significantly since then, arrived to pc in and to steam in .technically, it does have occasional glitch fixed by restarting game, such as when i couldn't remove elevator. and people say that they had their saves wiped out due to error or crash many hours later. so uncool.and eh, idle games are idle games. as far as i care, they are soulless. well, though this game has a bit of soul, in artstyle. it's really neat in-universe-cartoon thing. quite nice, mhm. none the less, the one who wins at these games is not the player who fully maxes it out after hours. nope, that one loses. the player who wins is the one who checks it out and goes away once it gets shallow.none the less, i tried. the normal play. there is your base building and basic recource management. wait long time to get smthing. can rush, with percentage that it can go wrong. the only microtransactions are either boxes of random stuff that you can get as loot anyway and ability to arrive to quests immeditly, doesn't matter much. usually you can leave the game for a while unless you sent dwellers out exploring, then it goes against whole idle thing with them possibly dieing out of injury while you aren't paying attention.i mean, it's not pay--win but it's still an idle game which is completely shameful on pc.it's actually funny how game was different combat systems in shelter and quests. in shelter animation matter zero, everybody's health is just getting slowly sapped by presence of npcs with their stats and only endurance stat matters for health. quest kinda does it more with aiming, attacks, critical hits minigames at rare times. but eh, still shallow.and yea, it's idle. i played normal vault for a while and stopped very quickly after realizing at how easy it will be. so i tried survival instead. and boy, instead of proper challenge i got cheese-land of cheesy tactics. it's hard but in merely annoying way, not the way that makes you think or tests you.here are some examples of these pro tactics that are based off real life:nothing bad ever happens if you don't pay attention to things. in survival mode you will be bombared with incidents every few minutes which will be sapping away health of your dwellers so in nutshell you want to do stuff and leave asap. leave workers to live happily and restore health, for we all know that presence of exploitative class brings only unhappyness and bad luck.just like in real life the best way to handle conflicts is just run away and ignore it. right? so if you ever get incidents, in order not to get health of dwellers sapped away, you just have to move them away from whatever or whoever is invading you. if it's internal then it will spread to horizontal and vertical rooms and then end. which also brings the only non-cheesy tactics of how to build base, aha. and if it's from outside then they just go through each row back and forth to the bottom and then go away. just send dwellers to rooms where they already passed. it doesn't even matter if they have to go through fire on the way, it only takes away health if they are assigned to same room. raiders also sap away recources while in shelter but in early game it's quicker to just let them run through than confort, thus takes less recources.did you know that pregnant women are the best workers? while they can't fight back or do quests or explore, their ai is set to always run from incidents, practically making them completely invincible. and you wait forever about bringing babies out of their bellies. what an utopia.it also seems that if you have too much population then their odor will spread all over the wastelands, bringing bigger threat in. as a result you will have to stop at certain population and then wait patiently as you grab the needed loot. send people on quests and exploration to gain better equipment before getting bigger. idling. don't upgrade to level rooms early either, makes bigger internal incidents there.overall, i quickly realized that in order to progress in survival i will have to wait for days to get better equipment and once i got into the fairly stable movement in the game i figured that this mobile idle game can't provide any more proper enjoyment and left the game.i've won.",0

2963,"yes, the game is really fun and addictive. at + hours i can say it is a true pay to win game. i do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money. there is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for xp so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ton of nickel and dimes. you will earn those same xp during each match, but at the rate of around to xp. it takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around skills (in tank battles). good luck earning xp by just playing. long story short, this game sucks for pvp because of pay to win. but is the best i have seen in a while for what i call eye candy (realistic looking models and fx) and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.ps. i would accept war thunder gold lion donations! lol",0

15538,"undoubtedly the best clicker game out there. at its core, you have tons of characters, each of them interacting with others to create the perfect formation to fight waves and waves of enemies of different difficulty. every single character has its own upgrades in the form of cards, and the cards have their own upgrades and so on, and so on. basically you have tons of upgrades, way more than your usual idle game. it can go as far as feeling like an rpg or even a strategy, rather than an idle game. especially if you check out the wikia page or any guide, and there are many.of course, in the middle of it all, are the chests, which are your micro transactions. you can buy them with real money, as well as specific cards and bundles, but crusaders of the lost idols is by no means pay to win/pay to progress. the player regularly receives codes for chests via e-mail, and there are plenty other ways to receive boosts without spending any money.events! the crusaders are filled with events on a regular basis, far more often than any game, idle or otherwise. they aren’t different from your regular runs, but the variety of characters you can acquire from them, is certainly keeping the game fresh.finally, the community. yes, a community in an idle game. moving on from the initial surprise - the game has an in-game chat, mostly alerting everyone when someone gets an epic gear, but also giving you the ability to ask questions or talk the day away. given that the crusaders is not a competitive game, the community is extremely friendly, by far the best one i’ve encountered online. i have observed people from all walks of life share their story through the chat, and it is… well, beautiful. no matter what type of gamer you are, this is something you can easily play between chores, or while doing literally anything - working, watching a movie, playing another game. i’ve enjoyed my fair share of idle games while doing tedious tasks, and crusaders of the lost idols is definitely keeping it interesting, being rewarding and a bit challenging to top it off.",1

7642,"it's basically grind some more - the game. no story, naration or plot. pw elements are present. however, it does have some things going well for it. +interesting and various classes+wide variety of dungeons+tons upon tons of collectibles: mounts, pets, boats, wings, gear appearances, weapon appearances +crafting, upgrades+and in case you're wondering, no, it has nothing to do with minecraft unfortunately, it's repetative . the only goal in this game is to grind up until you max everything out (if possible), so you can grind (even more) at a slightly faster pace. it's pve. pvp is bad and unsatisfying.and as mentioned, it is pay-to-win, even though you can earn everything through, guess what - grinding. even the currency, purchased with real money, can be obtained through playing, it just takes a lot of time.it takes some dedication to continue playing after a certain level, as there are difficulty spikes, quite possibly to make you buy upgrades on their store in order to move on, but everything is doeable, especially if you group up with a friend or two. the reason why i'd recommend trove is because it's free to play, there is constant progression and tons of collectibles, plus it's appealing to gamers who fancy their grindy-looty games. after a long day, i find myself logging on for a few dungeons and destroying some pixels. all in all, i've had a good time.",1

9793,"elsword is a side-scrolling arcade style beat-em-up, the game shines in the different classes and unlocking new ablities. they recently made leveling alot easier and you can get your final job advancement (nd one) in - days unless your playing on a saturday or sunday. the reason i say this is because elsword has a stamina system that goes down whenever you kill monsters in the fields, or when a monster dies in a dungeon. stamina is reset every night and all character's have seperate stamina bars, so if you run out of stamina on one character, just switch to another. also the maximum characters per account (without buying any) has increased from to i believe . a problem is that there is no character cuztomization if you dont spend real money, and the job advancement clothes they give you only last up to weeks before getting deleted. this makes some characters (like chung in my opinion) look really stupid, most others look fine though. some events have given out costumes but these are rare. the combat is nice and fluid as you can chain abilities with combos, and there are about abilities per character but you can only have four of them on your skill bar, you can sawp them but they only give you enough sp (skill points) to max out around so choose wisely (at each advancement you get a free potion that givs you back all your sp). for i think dollars you can unlock extra abilit slots for one character, but most abilities take mana and your max is so this is not essential to beat dungeons. dungeons are easy early on but they get harder to beat later in the game, the way they do this is kind of wierd. good healing consumables have to be bought or can be crafted with materials you get in dungeons (either way works) but after level it becomes a struggle to stay alive. its works like this, there are around to maybe enimes per entire dungeon after level , my one character has around k hp but a single enemy hit can hit me k to possibly k depending on what it is so killing enemies efficiently and not getting hit is the name of the game. life items can be found in boxes in the dungeons but these are used upon touching them are not abundent enough to sustain you through the entire game, on top of that the only way to get revives are though field bosses (rare to get revives from them), events, or buying them with real money. its hard to explain but pvp's are decieded by whoever can chain more combos with abilities without knocking down the opponent (this sorta goes for pve to but on a lesser scale), unless your in a v match and have team mates to interrupt the combo (start playing the game and it will make more sense). i have friends who i play with so i dont interact with the community that much but guilds are the way to go to socialize as dungeons are usually too crazy with all the fighting to type to each other. last thing i would like to point out is any dungeon can be entered from anywhere and you can que for player parties or just start instantly with whoever is in your party. all in all the game has its cons but being a free to play game it is worth a try as they are adding new content on a fairly regualr bases. now if youll exscuse me my fingers hurt.",1

15784,"i’ve not played much of this game, so its fair to say that i haven’t been able to experience all the features; however, i already see the aspects of the game which need emphasising and the problems of this game.the game is early access, so it has the odd bugs (a multicoloured polygon games springs to mind) but this isn’t something to get angry about in game before its official release. the team working on this is small, but the game is often updated, as is the outlined plan, and community engagement is fantastic from artix entertainment.it was the nostalgia of my playing aq worlds almost ten years ago that drew me to this game. it has some of the same charm and humour, but not to the same extent. at times the game can feel like its trying to hard to be what its predecessor was.the big question when it comes to this game is whether trying to make the game accessible for mobile gamers had limited its appeal and enjoyment for pc gamers. the answer, in short, is yes. the camera feels clunky and the game very much feels like its designed for regular visits and clicking which could be done on a small screen. the classic trope of mmos, grinding quests, are definitely frequent, toward the point of tediousness. some redesign is definitely needed in terms of quest placements and objectives. my main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quests (often quests are very small, possibly to make it them completable on the move) and so double the rewards for the remainder – with a slight increase in difficulty. i think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in terms of achievements rather than in gear. the game doesn’t feel like a life experience in the same way as other some mmos and rpgs, including aq worlds does, but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task. thus the problem is that the game feels far too much like a classic mmo and not enough like the game it could be; perhaps essentially what is needed is a slightly altered d version of the of artix’s more successful d games.another problem is the crafting system. when you collect enough raw material, npc crafting shops can make this into gear, for a price. this is quite basic and nothing i really have a problem with. the issue lies in the need to wait a set about of time (a minute, an hour, a day, etc.) in order to collect your new gear. it slows the game, and when you collect the item, it can sometimes be that it no longer feels worth the time as you’ve levelled up and found new equipment to use.the question that i think it comes down to asking yourself is whether it is better to invest your time in a game mid-development, or a game in what is essentially the dlc phase; should you play adventurequest d or aq worlds. for me, getting back into the latter is very daunting, with so much content – one of the reasons i often avoid mmos is because i feel so out of my depth when compared to players who have been around for so much longer. the d game is lacking, but it has fantastic potential, and will hopefully grew into the game it could be. it’s worth taking the time to try this game before dismissing it, especially for people who played artix games some years ago.",1

2072,"in my opinion it's the best action rpg that's on the market right now. it has a grim setting, and a story that's mostly told through environmental bits of lore, but most importantly it has a depth of gameplay that no other arpg comes even close to. it's the best spiritual successor to diablo ii to date. the first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed. there is a web with hundreds of choices. don't worry, eventually it will make sense. you can obtain respect points via quests and item drops, so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway.your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear. the gems have one of three colours (red/blue/green), that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear. sockets can be linked, allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems. this can do things such as splitting your burning arrow into projectiles, or turning your glacial hammer attack into an aoe attack that hurts monsters all around you. later in the game, you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage, or get stunned.every three months the devs launch a major patch with a new challenge league, which adds new skills, new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics.the free to play model is truly free to play. you can play all the content in the game without paying a dime. the only way the game developers make money is by offering microtransactions in their store, for cosmetic upgrades that don't affect gameplay. want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look? maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor looks. want your fireball to look like a dragon, there is a microtransaction for that! want a lizard with a bell on it's back to follow you around like a puppy? there's a microtransaction for that!i have put hundreds of hours into the game (using their native client because i started playing before the game was on steam) and found buying the microtransactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more (and more and more and more) content to the game, while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic microtransactions.there are a few non-cosmetic microtransactions available, to upgrade your account with more character slots (i believe the default is , so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the classes) and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters. the default you get is , which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in , but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in . there are also premium stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours.the game is free, so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game?",1

1266,"recommended to me by a friend, he said that he got it a year ago, and it was barely playable back then, but now, it's pretty awesome. as far as i'm concerned, it's a bit like league of legends meets eve online... without the £ a year subscription. the graphics look pretty sweet, and there's no evidence of pay to win (which is great) it's more pay to get something that looks cool, but is really difficult to use and there's a non-premium version of the vehicle anyway, so yeah, really nice and fair, despite me struggling at the game because it's very heavily tactics based... and i struggle with working with a team over the internet :p still, best purchase of in my opinion ;) actually, no, best purchase i've made on steam for a very long time ^_^ buy it buy it but it :",1

14836,"came back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that i no longer endorse this game. they had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (tl;dr alert) i've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why i don't play anymore. i used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. the removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. all of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. shooting said weak spots and watching % of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. it was the highlight of the game. the second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.how did this change? the removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. this absolutely destroyed the enjoyment of the game for me. i regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below % health, and this was due to having working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. the poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy % of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. it used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. i got destroyed all the time when i first started playing, but i did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about kills per game (no respawns when i played)i honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but i hate when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche. rip robocraft.",0
1139,"decided to give this game a try now that it is fp and i am very positively surprised.first impressions after a few battles.this is a very fun spaceship moba style game.space combat is engaging and you have to keep an eye on what side of your ship you show the enemy to prevent him from punching through your armor as well as trying to hit the enemy ships were there armor is down, which leads to some nice maneuvering fights.playerbase could be larger, but that as others have mentioned is most likely because it just went fp, the game certainly has what it takes to attract a lot more players and i would not be surprised if the player numbers go up quickly now.",1

10863,"i have had used steam for about years and this is my first ever steam review. this game is fantastic.it's easy to pick up but there is lots of tactical and strategic room for growth. some say it is like hearthstone but much better, and i would agree with that. it has a healthier economy (ie it is more rewarding and gives you more cards without having to spend money). but if you want to spend money to speed up your collection, that is always an option.i would compare it more to the card game magic the gathering. it takes the best of magic and hearthstone and leaves the worst out.the single player campaigns are pretty fun and give you a good start for your collection, then there are several game modes to play after that: gauntlet (free ai challenge with decent rewards) forge (draft mode against ai where you get to keep the cards you draft) draft (draft mode against other people where you keep the cards you draft) puzzles (exasctly what it sounds like--puzzles to help you learn strategy and game mechanics) casual (unranked play against player opponents) ranked (ranked ladder play against player opponents)the card quality is great, and the game is surprisingly well balanced. the developers have done a great job to maintain balance in the card pool. there is diversity in the meta, which is to say that there hasn't been one single deck that has dominated over everything else, because every strategy can be countered.the game is still pretty new, and there is only the base set and one expansion set out so far, but there are already a ton of cards and there is no shortage of cards or ideas for decks. the game was just made in a way that makes sense, and the devs have really put alot of thought into it. have a cool deck you want to share with your friend? easy, there is an export button in-game. find a cool deck online that you want to try out? easy--you can copy the deck and import it with one button. super user-friendly.if you are interested in theorycrafting, there is a great community here, on reddit, and other forums as well. people post deck lists all the time and there are plenty of startegy articles to get you started. here are a couple sites that are pretty popular to check out: www.reddit.com/r/eternalcardgame (reddit discussions) www.rngeternal.com (discussions about strategy, meta, etc.) www.eternalwarcry.com (easy place to post a deck idea or see what others have come up with)all in all, cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is interested in this type of game. good luck, and i hope you try it out!",1

11293,"i have to compare it with hearthstone because it's very similar and we all know that hearthstone is at the top right now. i will break into parts while reviewing.pay-to-win vs not so pay to winish as far as i played..we are all aware that hearthstone is pw, because without packs you can't have cards, without cards you can't make a decent deck without a deck you are enforced to lose. earning packs is not that easy or fun and when those hard-earned packs give you only rare card it gets really annoying. lets not forget that they bring a new expansion each - months or so you have limited time to get the cards you want. you can always pay though.. in this game as far as i have seen it is easier to earn and drop legendary and epic cards. i got like legendaries in my hour playtime. each pack gives you cards. you have more chance and you get what you deserve. p.s hearthstones pack rates made me a fckn psycho.. legendary in packs.gameplay-this game has so many card types that i can't even remember while playing. i think a majority them make no sense. charge,poison,stun,spells i can understand every card game has them but there are many others that i can't even remember their name. hearthstone is easier to understand for these aspects (idk in what condition it is right now). -so you can't attack minions in this game directly with other minions. you select your minions to attack, if the other player chooses to block with one of his minions, you attack the minion instead of the hero. it's a little different and i didn't like it. it gets so confusing with other aspects of the cards. while playing i was like how the f did he attack me and i couldn't? or i just blocked you how can you attack my hero? i simply don't like it.-your mana does not increase on its own. you deck consists of cards, of them are by default mana cards that when used you gain mana and can be used each round. this made the deck creation process more hardcore. you can decide on this yourself but sometimes i was drawing like no mana cards and stuck at mana while my oponent was at manas.events-singleplayer etci only played the tutorial singleplayer mode and it felt normal like hearthstone would have. also the same modes do exist like creating a deck and playing with other players until you loose a certain times for a prize.i think that is all. i was really hoping to like it but i did not. maybe i still have a love for hearthstone deep in(i don't play anymore). or maybe it's just bad and confusing like i said.",0

3051,"where can i start with war thunder? well, i'll start with the basics. i stopped playing about months ago and the whole game has changed. when i stopped, you had plane tiers. this meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. what this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. now, you have this tier system, which is no other word for it, it's just seeing it on steam, i redownloaded it and played in what is now called tier . what happens now is that instead of playing tiers out , you fight against tier out of . this means you are fighting people in planes that could have been tiers above you in the old system. for instance, you could be in a bi-plane just out of ww and someone in a mk spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. i really did love playing the short time i played. don't get me wrong, i loved it! but the problem is, i can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't thinkthrough. i cannot imagine playing it for more than hours, which is incredibly short for a game. if you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. it's fp and good fun and the start. but after the hours i played it as a tier , i cba with war thunder anymore.",0

8488,// alpha build reviewafter working myself up to diamond and a playtime of hours i figured i should give a little review for this game.rather than listing every single pro's and con's (that are subject to change during the alpha and beta anyways) i am just gonna point out the major things that realm royale in my opinion is doing better than every other battle royale out there. - the forging system : the forging system incentivises you to stay on your toes throughout the entire early to mid game. you are forced to actively look for fights to craft your legendary armor and weapons. camping in this game is heavily punished in the late game as you will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the players that actively did look for kills to craft their stuff. - map and circle : with an average gametime of around minutes per match realm royale is probably one of the fastest battle royale games out there. the circle actually hurts like hell in this game which means people will rarely unexpectedly sneak up on you from behind as gas camping is nearly impossible in this game. the map itself is relatively small compared to other battle royale games which means if u will sometimes unexpectedly find yourself outside the play zone it is not necessarily a death sentence. - the classes : in realm royale you can pick between the warrior/engineer/assassin/mage/hunter class which all are unique and fun in their own way. while certain classes like the engineer are easier to get into than other classes the variety of class specific abilities aswell as class weapons creates a very high skill ceiling for each individual class. - overall gameplay: unlike other battle royale games that incentivise you to find cars around the map each player has their very own horse they can ride to move faster from forge to forge which as mentioned in point leads to more fighting and therefore low downtime between all the stuff you have to do in this game. the sound effect are very loud. it is virtually impossible to sneak up on somebody as you will be able to hear their footsteps or shots from miles away. this in my opinion leads to less frustrating death experiences as its promotes a fair chance for each participant of the fight.these points alone make realm royale the best battle royale game that has been released since hz's early beta and offers everything i was always looking for in a battle royale game.- fast gameplay- more fighting than looting- high skill ceiling- no wall building bullsh*t (*cough* fortnite)keep up the great work hirez,1

11011,"if you're looking for a free to play card game that combines the best features of other franchises into one simple and elegant package with tonnes of strategic variation and depth, you've come to the right place.when you start playing this game, things hit you immediately:- the animation is fast and fluid. no time is wasted on flashy nonsense. the animations goes through quickly with minimal interruption, and still looks good! so most of your time is spent making decisions rather than impatiently watching stuff happen on screen.- if you're familiar with hearthstone and magic the gathering, then this game feels instantly familiar and easy to learn.it doesn't suffer from the rng self-destruction vomit that hearthstone has become.and it has a much more modern online client interface than the outdated relic of mtg online.- despite being in early access, it already has so much content. and even without having a full library of legendary cards, you have sooo many options in deck construction, strategy and interaction without paying a single dime.i was so impressed with the elegant design of all the cards and in-game interface that i bought some of the in-game currency just to support the developers. but i did not need it! you can earn and craft all the cards by playing very casually.there are several modes to play:- gauntlet: against ai decks. here you can test your new deck concepts and do some casual grinding for gold. extremely useful. and surprisingly challenging.- forge: also against ai. this is basically arena or draft but against ai. it costs half as much gold to enter than with draft, and the draft itself is cheap anyways. forge is good if you love draft/arena gameplay but don't like to wait for other players or don't like competitive play too much.- draft: you open a pack and pick one card. then you pass it on to someone else, and you pick another card from a pack passed by someone else etc... until the pack is empty. and then you repeat the process for a total of times.then you construct a deck from the cards you picked and play pvp. if you enjoy the competition and have the brains to stay competitive, this mode can earn you a lot of gold, packs and shiftstone (used to craft cards). best of all, you keep the cards that you picked! including the ones you did not use to make your deck.- ranked: pvp just like constructed in hearthstone. nothing special. i actually prefer constructed over draft due to the incredible creativity of the community. but that's just a personal preference. i like to test new concepts cuz it's so much fun.casual: pvp but without rank points. useful if you just want to enjoy the gameplay and complete quests without affecting your current rank.- events: every now and then, we get an event with special rules. i really like these because they make you think and build your decks in specific ways to capitalise on the battlefield conditions. plus, they are incredibly rewarding, so it's worth the effort.in addition, there are quests that require you to play certain colors or card types to unlock chests. this encourages you to get creative and try new things. just the usual card game incentives...i've seen most reviews and steam discussions complaining about the resource system (mana) borrowed from magic the gathering. indeed, you have to play sigils (lands) to gain power (mana) and play your cards.truth be told, the number of spells that draw sigils are somewhat limited. mtg had many more mana fetching and fixing cards. in eternal you need to give extra attention to include enough sigil fetching cards in your decks. seek power and find the way are extremely important. and card draw engines are a must have in every deck strategy. otherwise you will be at the mercy of top decks by turn .if you can get accustomed to the mana system and start brainstorming deck ideas, you're gonna love this game, especially if you like to be creative.if you can't be bothered, feel free to net deck. many new players net deck at first. in fact, the community is very generous and intelligent. and they love to share their ideas with new players.whatever your playstyle is, there is a deck for you. feel free to experiment. you'll be surprised by the magnitude of unlikely synergies you can discover. it's very enjoyable to have this eureka!! moment when testing new combos. eternal really encourages you to try new cards.there are a few slightly overused or unbalanced cards, but most of them are cheap to craft and everything can be easily countered with the right strategy. the silence mechanic is particularly powerful and almost essential to counter certain effects. i'm a little worried about the silence tbh, and i really hope they add a revert mechanic similar to hex: shards of fate. otherwise, silence effects would have to be deliberately kept few in number from now on because it's counter-interactive and not very fun.as far as card games go, i give this a solid /.if the devs keep an eye out on card balance and maintain their caution when releasing new cards, this game will be an excellent addition to any card game player's library, especially if you're tired of the old franchises that have become overburdened with their outdated online clients.try it and keep an open mind. you won't be disappointed.",1

8440,"notes: it's still an alpha, a few bugs but so far nothing game breaking or anything that cost me a fight core diffrences from fornight any unwanted loot can be exchanged for shards a resource you can use at a forge to generate gear the armor (shield) is made from the armor you pick up, the better the armor the more capacity you have for the armor bar, which can be refilled with a potion. the class abilities are very fun and add anew dynamic to fights. additionally the fact you can get upgraded versions which due more damange and shorter cooldown is also nice the rng of loot drops can be mitigated by using a forge. scrap the useless stuff, go to a forge and have it generate you a top-tier class specfic weapon, armor or ability at any point you can press z to summon a horse to get around/climb mountains quicker when your downed, instead of laying their and needing to wait for an ally, you instead turn in to a chicken. as a chicken you can run/jjump around, hop through small windows to avoid getting shot, and if you live seconds you auto-revive. allies can not revive you, instead their tasked on focusing to keep you alive. the map biomes/themes are pretty fun and diverse, you can go froma frozen tundra to a barren desert to a jungle temple etc. while it seems more cartoony than fornight even, the variety of locations and consistant art style and tones keep it visually appealing. the gun system is simpler, with some uniqe guns (poison), bows (hunter only) etc very important : when you deploy from the bus, you don't parashoot, you do a hero landing! you just crash land somewhere like a badass. no fall damange *other features* in-game voice chat game modes: duo & squad only",1

14021,"the game is free. expect bugs, a way for the devs to make money, and people and situations that willyou off. i've only played for a few hours but the game is good as it is. there's an open world mode and battle royal, so you can choose to have a more dedicated play experience or just constant br. things the game lacks- the game is in dire need of some actual vehicle gameplay. i think you can buy like in the open world mode but even then i feel like the price isnt worth it and the vehicles probably arent the strongest, (idk though).attachments for weapons, ive seen a few attachments laying around on the open world mode but never in br. i feel like it would be better if less pistols spawned on the ground and maybe attachments or other things the game lacks.in short this game would be the perfect fp openworld/br zombie game if it had - a new map maybe, upgraded textures or annimations, and sounds the sounds arent smooth and zombie vocals cut in and out over other zombies, attachments for weapons, pistols spawn out thein small areas. you might walk in to a building and find pistols yet not be able to find any in other areas.this review wasn't too well thought out i justa wanted to share how i feel about the game in its current state.",1

11880,"i've played this game for hours. as a paladin. the class that has the lowest dps. which sucks when trying to level. can you say 'boring'? i've clubbed everyone to death for . levels. there is a story to the game, but after level you enter into the pvp zones. that is where toons much higher than you dwell and try to kill you the moment you step up to a quest giver. to say i have no clue what the story is at this point is an understatement. what is it like to level a paladin at level ? well, i've killed mobs and performed questions; i'm only half way to level .i am so bored of this game.the only way i'll keep playing is if the devs make me th level. cus if level is any indication, ill have to kill another , mobs and perform quests to hit . just... not... worth... it.you want to know what is in and not in the game? read the , reviews. want a fun game? this one is not it. players are leaving this game.",0
4685,"i say other games like dota allstars, dota and heroes of the storm that i've played are all great games and deserve /. (and other dota-like games that i didn't mention are just shadowed by dota) but they aren't as action-packed, aren't as visually polished as smite; their ranged attack can't be dodged or blocked; their combat field / lane / jungle are smaller, more crowded with incommensurately large model of characters and spells; their heroes have eyes in the back of their heads. for example, i think dota's artwork is great. the other day, i roomed in and found out a man are almost as high as a tree and the landscape is just non existent, i'm so disappointed that i suddenly found out i'm just not playing an aaa game.for the action-packed, juking and vision part. go google smite top plays casted by inuki and one will feel the thrill that other mouse-clicking dota won't give. just remember, when one dashes forward in smite, he/she will see everything moving backward and will have effective vision field shrinking. compared to the more boring degree vision field of most other dota games, one only have part of degrees in smite.i said other popular dota-like games are great, but the comparison is cruel. so either / to them and / to smite. or, if one can't accept they're , then / to them and / to smite. deal with it.",1

10144,"i am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.*** gameplayi tried this game and liked it so much that i purchased a one-year membership after a few days. the relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. you basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. there are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. you will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. tracking gets easier the more you play. with the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. it also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. this game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time. *** membershipsall players start as guest and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. a membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. a permanent license is not available.*** hunting groundsthe reserves in the western part of this world resemble of american continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in europe. currently seven reserves are available. each has its own charm and of course its animal species. at the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. you can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. the maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.*** animalsat this point the game features species. some of them can attack the player. many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. for many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. shooting animals in thehunter quite demanding. the animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.*** weaponsa host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. using the open sights can be just as much fun though. depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. there is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals. shooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.*** equipmentthere is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. there are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting. *** in-game moneyall game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. it can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires. *** missionscurrently there are a total of missions available. most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. you will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.*** competitions & leaderboardscompetitions are run around the clock for all animals. players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. the top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. in addition em$ can be earned. all animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. the best players will make their way into the hall of fame. *** multiplayermultiplayer parties are client-based, there are no mp servers. in the game it is possible to chat with others. players can hunt as team or on their own. it is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.*** things i don't like- the website's style is not outdoor-like. also the font size and the line spacing are too large. there is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store.- the large antlers of the red deer are completely unrealistic. the red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being european.- some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. the most obvious ones are the brown bear and the roe deer.- it is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them. sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.*** conclusionthe game is constantly being enhanced with new content. it remains one of the best games i have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. it is unique with its lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. there is a great random factor and unpredictability, which i think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. i keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old.",1

9156,"planetside is a very well-designed, highly involved mmo. simply put, it is the free-to-play title done right. from my short time with this game, i can find just two major issues: the graphics and the tutorials. bottom line, if you don't have a powerful system, this one's virtually unplayable. i tried feeding this to my three-year-old laptop, and it just spat it out. it's not a game in which you can get away with having a low frame-rate or sub-par hardware. and despite having rather intricate mechanics, it also doesn't have in-game tutorials; in order to learn how to play, the player must visit the planetside website and sit through several long-winded (albeit still quite informative) tutorial videos. i think this might become a substantial obstacle to expanding the playerbase--it's not very inviting to new players. the confusion one might still experience at the start potentially turns them off to the game, and thus they may never pick it up again.graphics and learning curve aside, if you've got a nice system and are willing to put the time and effort into orienting yourself, planetside has a lot in store.",1

1053,"the game is early access, so you have to understand what you're getting into: it has some game-crashing bugs, balancing needs fiddling, the menus are frustrating at times, and there isn't a whole lot of explanation (particularly regarding controls). if you want a game in a more fleshed-out state, with only a few, minor bugs, and polished interfaces, this is not the game for you!that being said, as far as capital-ship-fighting games go (a sadly limited genre), this one is pretty damn good. the graphics are impressive, with lots of explosions back and forth, and ships that are well designed with all the blinking lights and gew-gaws we've come to expect. the controls are simple and (mostly) intuitive, such that some basic playing around will make sense out of most of them, all the while giving you the feeling of being at the helm of a massive warship.the basic gameplay is essentially that of a moba (league of legends, defense of the ancients, etc.). you'll jump from sector to sector, capturing space facilities and engaging enemy players. sometimes it'll be a solo encounter, two ships bobbing around each other, exchanging fire and close-range missiles. other times, both fleets will meet and light up the darkness between asteroids. both are impressive in there way, and fans of star trek, star wars, and battlestar galactica will feel right at home!ships come in various classes, from your stealthy cloakers, to the fast-attack hunters, to long-range artillery ships, and all the way up to capitals with broadsides that can make a planetits pants. each has a primary weapon and secondary ability (slaved to the left and right mouse buttons, respectively), plus other support abilities used via the number keys. you can move in all dimensions (x, y, and z for you cartesian-types), though you cannot pitch or roll. it has that slow, lumbering feeling you would expect in such large vessels, but without feeling sluggish or unresponsive.if you don't feel comfortable purchasing early access games, the developers are planning to take it fp early next year. if nothing else, give it a shot. you'll be pleasantly surprised!full ahead, helm!",1

2795,"yeah i'am still playing this game and hoping that it will change... first:it is ing unbalanced as hell... if you had played this game for a while, you will start to notice that not only by ranks match making is working, but with battle rating too. for example:iii tier tank br: ., ., ., ., ., . (if you got . you are ed, the match making will put you with br . all the time and sometimes . will apair, after a week of grind and wasted all your nerves, you will get . tier and will think : finaly, i have walked out of thisquot;) however, you will go of course for tier iv , now whats happens:iv tier tank br: .,.,. (it seems ok, the max br that you will get in the team is . its about : of battles) but if you got . br iv tier tank, you will be placed with max . tier witch is much more powerful when shity .

7537,"this is one of the rare few times i will write a serious review so read carefully.trove is a ver addicting game with countless hours of gameplay. even though i only have + hours into trove, i highly recommend it if you like adventure multiplayer/singleplayer games. now lets move to pros and cons show we? pros: -a very fun and addicting game that is actually free to play!-item gear rankings, the higher the gear the better, once you get to uber and above its a every time legendary -very smooth frames and fun gameplay mechanics-each class is something new not just a recycled concept which can lead to hours of fun gameplay-no pvp, which means no overpowered uber players kick new players arses in combat-club worlds! create a club and a club world where only you and your friends can hang and build together-each dungeon is equal, meaning that a pirate biome dungeon isn't harder then a cursed vale dungeon biome-shadow levels! increase you level from the max of cons; -the game can get very tedious grinding for flux-the game can also be very tedious trying to get a legendary or higher if you dont improve your magic find-you must pay attention to the tutorial or you will get very lost mid game-although they are fixing this, queue times are very long on weekends due to weekend traffic-if you run out of potions mid battle with a dungeon boss, your screwed-corner stones can be hard to find at times-you have to mine for materials to make new portals to uber and above-mushrooms-i find that challenging dungeons at uber and bove can prove to be very difficult at times-wings dont come to you early and are quite hard to obtain-you are stuck to one class and cannot change unless you collect cubits daily or spend in game currency final thoughts: trove is a very fun game and i highly recommend it. while it may seem that some of my cons are a bit bias or even very true, the game has a lot of pros that will make up for them. it's also worth mentioning the game never once puts you in a postion that makes it seem like spending real life money is a must. if you like singleplayer open world adventure games, or even a multiplayer play with your friends game, then trove is the game for you! also i personally recomend the neon ninja and the shadow hunter for beginners, but mostly neon ninja if you like to be up in the front lines, shadow hunter is a ranged class requires more brainpower and strategy.",1

6787,"new update: it is virtually impossible for you to earn more war credits in a game than what it cost to repair and refill ammo in just a single game. basically this means is it is impossible to progress through in the game without shelling out some real money. the issues with the game with new players still remain below.don't play this game, it is very unfirendly to new players. the community is very toxic towards new players as well, the 'vets' claim it's skill is why 'noobs get owned'. but if you happen to pick up a dead vets weapon then it becomes apparent that skill has nothing to do with it. i picked up a dead vets light machine gun and it was more accurate than my infantry standard bolt action rifle at long range. clearly my score increased dramtically whenever i had the opputunity to pick up an upgraded weapon, so 'skill' as the toxic vets say is just their way of inflating their eit doesn't help that the game throws you in the sharks pit once you hit lv (roughly hours gameplay). after level you can be matched with anyone, this puts you at a severe disadvantage and you are forced to try and grind (performance based leveling up) vs oponents that are much better equiped than you are. if the xp you gain was fixed rarther performance based (kills etc) i would feel the need to try and slog through it. but it feels like you're trying to push sh*t uphill rarther than play the game.",0
12992,"tl;dr - fallout shelter is fun for what it is - a quick diversion while you drop the kids off at the pool, or when things are slow at work, etc. i played the game on my phone for a couple weeks and maxed out my dwellers and rooms, and so forth. opinions and things of note from my playthrough:it's a pseudo-strategy upgrade'em up, vault-building farmville-like game that is also reminiscent of sim tower. the comic art-style is well executed with cutesy and fun animations and effects which the dwellers exhibit while carrying out their lives.bonerkill alert: grabbing and dragging dwellers is awkward and inaccurate, even on pc, especially when zoomed out -> grabbing them accurately requires zooming in, but moving them to where they need to go often requires zooming out again.double bonerkill alert: the emphasis on microtransactions in fallout shelter are disappointing, although not unexpected considering the original platform and target audience.entitled gamer conclusion: it's unfortunate that bethesda used their time and effort, and this great ip to make a weak mark on it's legacy. i think i speak for many fans when i say we would have been happier to pay outright for a more serious entry for mobile platforms, perhaps something along the lines of fallout/ii/tactics.",0

12341,"quick and dirty review, this mmo is not absolute trash, but i have no confidence in the ability of the team to actually right this ship and make this game anything better than a mediocre mmo.first off the game launched with only one server, one. i understand that they couldnt let people pre order because it was in early access (more on that later) so they were not sure how many servers they needed, but really, one server...thats either a complete lack of conficene in your product, or inexperence with mmo's in general. you dont have to have worked on an mmo in the past to know how mmo lauches go, and they are never smooth, so why hamstring yourself with one server when there are so many examples in the past that you can look at that tell you this is a horrible idea.second the translations are bad enough that people were having trouble going through the tutorial because it was telling them to mount (the term this game uses when it means equip) abilities that were not in the game. its engrish so its not so bad you cant figure it out, but its very lazy, and just another log on this trashfire.third is the end game content, it was cut out. honestly, that by itself is not horrible, there have been other mmo's that have had limited end game content and this really only affects players who poop-sock the game and reach end game in hours or so. however, this is worth mentioning here because this game has already been launched in korea, japan, and russia. we have three other regions where this game is not early access, its a completed game, being used right now, and has been since . there are changes to this release, but those changes were to the combat system, the developers have not said that the base content of the game was changing, only the combat, the background numbers of this game. re-balancing aside, why would content need to be cut? speaking of cut content, they also removed the action combat mode that they proudly showed as a selling point for this version from all but the berserker class. nobody really knew they were doing this, or why. on launch day there were scores of people asking in global chat how they could turn it on. apparently their reasoning is that it needed tweaking and would be added at a later date, no eta has been given other than later date.lastly, optimization is very bad. the game does not utilize the gpu much and because it uses dx it also doesn't utilize multiple core cpu's. so there are bottle necks abound and your beast of a machine is going to have issues pumping out more than fps, and just get out of the main cities as fast as you can. there are .ini fixes that you can use if your comfortable manually editing those files, but these are mods that you will have to do.all in all, nothing here is a deal breaker, but all together it just sucks the fun out of the game. that and the droning fanbois defending all the mistakes saying its early access. you know what, it should not have been early access. what they said they were going to change is not enough to justify saying that this complete game from another region that needs translation and a combat overhaul is going to need to be re-tooled soo much that it needs to be sold as early access, i think they did this just to give rabid white knights a talking point to try and quell anger to keep sales up just that little bit longer.i foolishly stuck it out when soo many other were refunding this game because i wanted to see what this team could do, but after this most recent patch, a - percent nerf to damage across all classes, i cant help but feel like this team just doesn't know what they are doing and don't know what to do now. it seems to me like the na team don't really have the experience they need for this project and instead are just sacrificial lambs to the slaughter while neowiz try to siphon just a little more cash out of a ip that failed times already. maybe keep an eye on this game and check it out in months, but right now spend you time and money elsewhere.",0
12244,"what started as a normal mmo launch full of bugs, the game has cleaned itself up! the developers are on top of things and are adding additional content quickly. i highly recommend this game for someone looking for a new mmo to try out. i have always been a wow player, but it is getting stale. bless is a nice breath of fresh air, adding in some old mmo styling and features (which newer mmo players might not like). give the game a try for yourself instead of relying on youtubers looking for views. it's a great game with a bright future.",1

848,"it's very rare that i am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i don't like. wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game...i mean this game is bad and i mean really bad! the map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. oh let's not forget when i logged in for the very first time, i received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. i literally got invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. i could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. an option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. my gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. i lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out i did not hit him once! so throughout the match i sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. and of all the ridiculous solutions i've found this has got to be the worst. i found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. the trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (i know i'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.and then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which i gotta say wow. people who hack in this game are way too comfortable in cheating. from what i've seen these hackers walk around like yeah i'm cheating...the f*** you gonna do about it?! in some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. but not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so i guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. shame on me for not noticing this sooner. i get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. this game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. the problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (who knows you miles may vary)",0

1724,"i have been playing this game for over a year and i have to say that before i knew about dota , i never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain i've ever felt. really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. the community is horrible as and so is the matchmaking. people picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). so i am asking myself: who in the hellinto their head for them to do such stupid things? it' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! and when there are already carries, why the do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? that makes no sense! while playing dota i discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. normally i'm a calm and relaxed person but dota forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realized that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the , too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are s again. that's why i prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. if it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: rip! there is no more to say, really. you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up. furthermore, you will waste more or less minutes of your precious time. but trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. and because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting dota . no, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. you can't get out of it. you are trapped in this game. it's really sad. i've tried so hard but always end up playing when i have some time.so here are my advices:. never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.. always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. or maybe for more flaming.. schedule your free time. it's not only minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. sometimes the whole day is ruined by dota . once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.. you have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. there is no other way to endure this community.you get it? great! then i wish you guys lots of joy playing dota ! :",1

7512,"just to get this straight this game is just like freaking minecraft! but positively like minecraft. the game starts off as a tutorial and when your in the tutorial you get to pick between a variety of classes. originally, the main classes you got to pick in the beta of the game when it first started was a knight, a gunslinger, a candy barbarian, or a dracolyte. classesknight- mainly used for tanking. can withstand many enemies. great damage. close range. has a passive skill that when hit your next attack deals more damage. the great thing about knight it is good for soloing but damage is not that great.gunslinger - has an advantage at range. uses a gun. good for damage. has a passive skill that when shooting in the air while attacking an enemy in the air while airborne your next charged shot will be instantly charged without cost. candy barbarian - mainly uses melee weapons as an advantage. close range. can withstand many enemies. skills provide healing and can hit multiple targets. good for damage or for soloing.dracolyte- this is most likely a overrated class in my opinion but i'm not saying the other three classes are bad but this class has just got more advantages and it's just so overpowered to use. uses a staff and the freaking skill is a flamethrower that lasts forever until the enemy dies. the most awesome thing about the last or ultimate skill of this class is that you get to transform into a fire- breathing dragon that is most powerful than your flamethrower and it can literally annihilate everything well i'm just exaggerating if you know what gear to equip. also in trove you get to build your own house and make cool pixels like pokemon, and other stuff which are like the things you need to build in minecraft but your going to have to mine for blocks just to build stuff.in that case, the game is fun, building is enjoyable, and having a fire - breathing dragon is the most coolest thing i've ever seen in my life.",1

2591,"two years ago i would have recommended this game. now i can't.i don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call war thunder a simulator), so i can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.but i can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.there are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. when you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. at the start of the game it isn't too bad. a low tier plane costs around rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least per match if you do well. that's games, fair enough.the problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. to get a tier plane (the game has tiers), the fw -d for example, you will need , rp, while you are only able to earn rp on average. that's about games for one plane, and each game takes about minutes.that means you need to grind for hours for plane. want to get a jet? play matches.the game doesn't reward you for playing well either. even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the mvp, the game will only give you a pitiful - rp at most. it's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. on top of that, gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. they could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. this means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. so to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time i mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. rp gain has been reduced over time by approximately % (not even kidding) since i started playing. this is also why i have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly.this makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why i quit playing it.now the second issue - balance. this one is a lesser issue to me because i didn't play game for historical matchups.the game uses a system called battle rating to match different planes together in a battle. a plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. the problem is that the battle rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.you will see planes from face planes from , and planes from facing planes from even .planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.keep in mind that world war lasted years, and so a year difference is huge. also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.the result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he -a, fa buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course i'd get next to no reward for this, but i sure would make a lot of people frustrated).in the case of the he -a, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.on the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in realistic battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all nations.so why do these matchups exist? that you can ask only gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in war thunder.this brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.any of the above will likely never be fixed. the developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. they don't read the english forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.the way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. the post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. there are many more problems with the game that i haven't mentioned because i haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).i'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.everything works perfectly well in gaijin-land, comrade! (except it doesn't).tl;dr:if you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. it is free after all. but it's a waste of your time.",0

11053,"if you came here to expect a better hearthstone alternative, go look elsewhere (i'd recommend elder scrolls legends in that department). eternal is a great adaption of a magic the gathering style cardgame. i played various different card games over the past years and can explain the reasons for my perspective (even with the current small amount of playtime in eternal)eternal card game is remodelled version magic the gathering. it only differentiates in a few aspects. this isn't entirely negative as eternal focuses on online gameplay while most people know that the mtg online client is for most parts.let me go into detail about the things eternal has in common with hearthstone and magic (i'll only use these two as examples, since they are the most known).hearthstone similarities:- presentation (ui, voiceover, design, boardinteraction, etc...)- business model (prices for packs/arena/story/etc...)magic the gathering similarities:- core game mechanics--> blocking attackers--> using counterspells--> building up mana using cards (without tapping)--> keyword mechanics (such as flying, trample/overwhelm, etc...)--> mixed decks (using cards from more than one faction/hero/color)even though the looks and the online play model are very similar to hearthstone (which i believe is a great feature (hearthstone ui is beautiful)), the core mechanics of the entire game are vastly different, a lot more like magic the gathering: building up mana requires manacards (sigils/lands), attackphases have room for interaction (i.e. blocking/counterspelling), damage distribution of minions is altered (not easy to explain in short), arena (draft) has a slightly different model than hearthstone and you get to keep all drafted cards, other minor differences.i see quite a potential in eternal as a card game, especially as it delivers a very good online mode for a mtg style game, while adding unique features to not make it look and feel like a carbon copy. it's also quite easy to pick up, but unlike hearthstone, where netdecking (copying playermade decks) alone can get you to high ranks without much effort, eternal requires some good mechanic and card understanding to rise from amateur to novice and even more to master.presentation: ./gameplay: /accessibility: /overall rating: ./ (for now).i recommend eternal to any/all card game fans.",1

2393,"this game is pretty good. i've been playing diablo since it came out, and path of exile just blew my mind at first. the ammount of costumization compared to diablo is insane. true classic hardcore gameplay in which you can do whatever you want with your class of choice. itemization and gem system are also insanely customizable. it's like a dream come true for someone that have been in a cage (diablo ) for some years. huge amount of little mechanics that keeps your head busy for a long time while you're playing the story. also at this point there's already much more story content: acts with incredibly varied storylines and distinct artstyle for each world region. i love diablo but poe is on a whole another level entirely. this is easily the new standard of modern arpg. now for the cons:- huge letdown is that microtransactions are way too effin expensive, if you're outside us. they've simply converted their dlc store from us dollars to whatever currency it's used in your country, so if my currency is like : usd, i'm f-ed. a set of skin in this game is worth more than month minimum wage salary here. i don't care about skins but other stuff are needed to play this game confortably, like stash tabs. i can't take this game seriously if i know i won't be able to keep my sanity in the long term. the game is good, but food and housing comes first.- trade system is archaic, to say the least. i know they're trying to replicate diablo nostalgia here, but its a process that aged very poorly. the game absolutely need an in game full fledged market system. i'm glad there's any trade at all, but i often want to quit the game just because trading is so cumbersome. you have to pm people, hope that they're online and wait for replies that almost never come.",1

(touched on more in suggestions from community)-ranked battles dont seem to hold any affect on a player-bots in the sport minigames are not very reliable ever at all lollike any game under development still they like other games should take suggestions (which bralhalla seems to do quite often anyways)suggestions from the community-adding more varied maps seems to be like a solid feature. maybe a map that changes terrain every once in a while or a map that increasingly gets smaller, even bigger elaborate maps would be cool to have along with the smaller ones!-adding more items in battle would make the game ever more interesting. things like a long range gun with few bullets or a really hard hitting weapon that doesnt last vary long, short boosts that increase speed, hit speed, damage, defense, etc would be cool too. a super move as well kind of like the final smash in you guessed it super smash bros brawl is probably my biggest request though in this catagory.-adding a point to ranked battles would make the game even more important!! trust me on this!! more people would be willing to dedicate time and effort to ranked matches so therefore brawlhalla if winning a certain number of matches granted you a certain prize. the best idea i could think of is seasons. every once in a while there will be short seasons. depending on where you place at the end of each season (bronze, silver, gold platinum and the number) you would get a rarer random mystery item(s). the items can range from skins to taunts to money to xp to even mamoth coins!-more minigames would also be a blast and just make this game more enjoyable to play ecspecially with friends. bombsketball and the football gamemodes are an absolute blast and same for win based on kills and stock mode. adding things like survival where you need to fend off against powerful bots each round and you prograssively get certain stat boosts, heling aid, etc. another crazy gamemode would be where each round or every few mins or seconds you get a character change, stat changes, etc.all in all this game really is just superb. most of my cons werent even fair because this is an early access game.

1164,"well i been playing this for a couple of hours now so i ready to tell you what i think. for the a free to play game i'm impressed you start off with four ships all seem good enough to get the job done. you can earn more as you play prices seem reasonable. the game play is casually competitive with some ship roles that change the way you tatically need to think. the ships comes along with your own crew that provides minor bonuses to it. seems this crew is some how customizable but i have yet to get a new member. the game has a reward system for play up to six matches a day. every match you play earns you credits to buy new ship. as far as the pvp matches go they seem balanced and most the time pretty close or right down to the wire. i have yet to play a match that i have just wanted to surrender. has coop vs ai if you like that rout. all in all for free to play this game i would recommend it and even think of a future purchase cause of how the game is structure to make it ends meet. so if you like space, action, ships and a team based game then give it a try.",1

5017,as you can see i play this game quite a lot. i love the game. it has a lot of different weapon and characters and they all have different combos or as we call them strings. when i first started playing i didnt understand what was going on but when i searched (...) combos on youtube i understood what i had to do and it made everything way easier and more fun! im a season diamond (if you count this seasons) and i can say that i still enjoy this game a lot. the community van be cancer though :/.,1
6237,"pheeew i have waited a long time to write this review. heroes and generals is the best made game i have ever played, but... the most poorley made game i have ever played. you start up the game, pick a faction: russia (the one everybody loves), germany, (the one everybody hates), and the allies (the other one). when you first start playing, it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing, and you generally have a good time. then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like, with smgs, semi auto rifles, bolt action rifles and good stuff like that. also, you die super fast, and don't expect to have health regen. if you get hurt, the game will not help you out, so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently (or inconveniently) around the map. same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or anti-tank weapons. but you will die (trust me, you will) and you will spawn back in... at the other side of the map hahahahaha! yes, you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die. i suggest that you invest in your faction's truck early on. speaking of vehicles, the gameplay with them is crazy, fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics. but they have one other type of vehicle... tanks. oh dear lord tanks! where do i even begin... okay. i can do this. you will have ptsd after playing for the first time with tanks. they are op as balls and make you die and respawn, but we already covered that. if you don't take the game seriousley, as i often just mess around, they can add some fun to the game, but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it. oh, and planes are the same thing, except you can't destroy them nearley as easily as you can with tanks. then i bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game.now, i will tank i mean talk about the largest issue with the game. the grind. after the first set of vehicles and weapons, tier ii weapons all cost way too much. you can't make the money that you need because of another system i will talk about later. because of the low amount of maps to play on, there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons. you can't even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you don't have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it. i will give you an example. say i am playing as the allies. i want the thompson smg, a ka bar knife and some stick grenades. i have the m garand, and i level up my infantry assault ribon to level to get the grease gun smg and some pinaple grenades. now i buy a shovel, because i need to get to level in close combat to unlock the knife. i use the smg, but then i'm not using the grenades, so i can't level up in explosives. i switch to grenades, but then i'm not using my shovel so i'm not leveling up close combat. i use my shovel, but then i'm not using my smg. i pick up the smg that the enemy i just killed dropped and use that. but then i'm not getting xp in my grease gun so i can upgrade it. so it goes in a terrible circle.i do like one system in the game, beleive it or not: the weapon upgrade system. if you use a weapon of your faction a lot, you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it, like springs, sights, barrels and some cosmetic things like skins. i like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most. for instance, i like the m garand. a lot. i first used it as a sniper weapon, changing the ammo, getting better gas sealing and even a scope. but then i changed it to a close-quarters weapon, taking off the scope, lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire. there is a downside to this system, however.the game's repair system, ho mama. every bullet you fire, every vehicle you spawn, every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag. it costs money, lots of it. i kind of like the system, as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary, but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own. also, you guessed it- upgrades cost money between matches, so the game also punishes you for using them, which is a little strange.here are my suggestions to make this game better.. add more weapons, so skill trees don't only unlock you one or two weapons. lower the prices on everything, the game grinds on for way to long. add more maps, the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools, playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast..balance your damn tanks.place spawn points much closer to the action.okay... my opinion of this game... i like this game and want it to be good, but it is constantley held back from all these problems. and i know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff, but that is no excuse for what we have now. they should have waited much longer on releasing this game, as i am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks. but one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play, as of now. my final rating for heroes and generals is a /.i will continue to update this review as the game progresses. that will be added to the bottem of the review",1

2667,"as a veteran player of this game with over hours before finally throwing in the towel... it's full of development bias, a salty community and very questionable business practice. they've hired research consultants who generally make up their own facts and have no background in historical research, treat their players more like cattle than consumers and have two separate development teams; one for russian vehicles, another for everything else. that alone raises a few red flags.i really tried to like this game and sunk a lot of time and effort into it and it's community, but all i have to show for it is the company banning both myself and dozens of other users for critical thinking of their product and business, and have received everything up to and including death threats from community members solely because i have differing interests and views.the game was once fine, but gaijin has been progressively ruining it by pandering to their home nation rather than the international market and feels that their player base is disposable, milking them for a few bucks and then kicking them aside for a few new players rather than trying to maintain the interest and respect of their veteran users.play at your own risk.spoiler: russia wins.",0

2529,"while this is a good game, it is rediculously biased. when i first got this game it was a blast and i had a good time. so based on gameplay i would have given it a positive recommendation. i am an older gamer, from the mid 's and as a rule i dont like making ingame purchases. but i am also an american and lack common sense. ask any canadian about us. anyways, i made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all lost when i bought some upgrades. by no means did these upgrades use all of it. i submitted a ticket and to make a long story short i was told i would not be refunded the ingame currency and that i must have spent it all. what makes this all ludicrous is i never recieved the upgrades i supposedly spent everything on. i never played it again. in hindsight i dont feel i really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. so i hope my review will temper the very positive rating they have right now since i dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. i will just go back to wot where i haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your iq is points above . that would be points for all you guys who dont quite hit the mark...",0

2361,"to start on a positive note, path of exile takes the diablo formula and expands on it in every single way possible. it has an incredibly complex crafting, leveling and gear progression system, which is growing and becoming more intricate with every single update and hasn't been matched by any other game in the genre to this date. the music is excellent, the environments are alluring and the lore is fascinating, but what brings the game down is a staggering amount of well documented technical issues that plague it, ranging from poor optimization to server stability. the servers simply cannot handle prime time, especially after the release of the new expansion. and since this is a free to play game, making server stability a priority is clearly not in the cards for the developers. it's completely understandable from a business standpoint; however the game is no longer playable for me and many other people in its current state. even if you were to overlook the incredibly poor optimization of its dated engine, the developers refuse to focus on stability issues, churning out new content and micro transactions, instead of fixing the game and making it accessible to a larger player base. the issue will become more prevalent in the future, as more and more players jump on the bandwagon with every new expansion.",0

5800,this game is for everyone who likes fighter aircraft and wants a good (not perfect) simulation. in the base game you only get planes so i would recommend purchasing a dlc (flaming cliffs for example) if you enjoy the game. the game also comes with a mission editor which is very detailed but still not to difficult to use. if you aren't sure if you should get this game you can give it a try anyway it´s ftp after all.,1

14559,"product received for freeearly access reviewfirst, let me take you back when this game was good. i was looking for a game that was, of course, multiplayer and really wasn't a big pay to win game like most of the free to play games on steam are. (free to play does come with a cost). the game was easy to learn and allowed great creativity in designs of bots and strats. they added new blocks every update or so, that even furthered the game play by allowing users to unlock them in the tech tree and play enough games to save up and buy it. i've kept a watch on the updates and finally re-downloaded the game to see some of the recent changes, as its been awhile since i played. i was very intrigued by the new game modes and ability to put multiple weapon types on your bot at a time. which i personally thought was a step up and further gameplay mechanics. however, upon entering a game i was quickly destroyed by a guy camping with these lock on missile launchers. at first, i was amazed at the power of these weapons but, after a few minutes of repeatedly getting spawn killed by the same guy started to take a toll on me. i looked at the block store and the price for one is outrageous. owning one means you don't have a life, or you do and you wasted your hard earned earnings on an item that is op. now, of course, the whole loot crate thing which is a totally different story by itself. what happened to you play a game and you get money? now you get random drops from a loot crate. the drops depending on how bad your team sucked. with this, i can see how this might be good for low-level people who take what ever they can get to improve their bot. in the late game, i totally waste my time and money by selling these or so random drops to save up for an item i do want. like those lock on rockets for example. premium is trash. currently have a -day premium from confirming my email, so first-hand experience! with premium, you get an extra or so items that i think have a slighter chance of receiving a rare item. which then i sell anyways. the gui for building your robot i think has improved greatly. i am now allowed to mirror blocks that make building speedier. then there are premium paint colors! seriously guys? i cant paint a block a certain color without premium? what a joke. currently still trying to find the tech tree and will hopefully report back when i find it! my current ship was a medic flyer which i flew around the map healing, everyone. i joined my first arena match with it and like i said earlier, i was getting spawn killed by that little ***. i then realized after the fact that the nano disrupters now don't do damage to enemy players? what? they pretty much nerfed everything except those rare items and up. if you like to waste your money on this game and buy your way up the ladder than look no further because this is the game for you! just enter your card number and instantly win every match you play! after a week or so of nonstop fun, you will then realize that it gets old and you wasted or so dollars on a game you don't want to play anymore. for a game that started out with a lot of potential, i'm sad to say that this game has turned to a pay to win hell hole. i did enjoy this and have had good moments with this, and i do recommend this to new players who need a game that can be easily run on low-end computers. however if you have a higher end computer world of tanks or minecraft if you want to keep the creativity aspect. i will still keep on looking for the updates for improvement that might improve this game. yes, i still do have hope, just very little. meanwhile im moving to the dying cod franchise where i can experience the satisfaction of eliminating a team of little kids by myself. without having to pay to win.btw- i did not waste any money on this game and i am proud to say everything i earned was earned legitly through game play. so i cant really fully say its a pay to win but it sure does come in handy!",0

6623,"heroes & generals had potential, but had to mess it up with greed and apathy. this game had so much potential to be a good game, in fact it was a good game before these updates messed up everything. the updates ruined the german faction to the point that any game with the germans is a near certain loss, they don't listen to community requests and go on their own to buff things making them op or nerfing the hell out of items whcih devalues the time put in that endless grind to get any item in this game. it took around the hour mark to actually get a bare sniper rifle for my infantry which needs an extra hours to get the essential attachments to be any use in matches. moving to gameplay, it used to be pretty fun with games having an even match that last a considerable amount of time compared to the current match stomps, where you only see paratroopers and people sneaking past the lines to steal the obj while the other team goes for their base. i have seen countless times where our or the enemy team, after a long battle capturing the objective, getting their point capture by those paratroopers that drop in every minute right before the point was secured. moving past that, infantry destroys tanks which makes them obsolete, there's barely any reason to play recon since everything is speeden up from the constant stream of crappy updates, and they ban many people who hadn't even done anything, there's too much to list and it makes this game incredibly boring as well as tilting. i can't find any reason why you would play this game in it's current state unless you want to waste time or money (which i might add is completely pay-to-win since the most op weapons are sitting on top of a hefty grind or a pretty penny). this game is horribly executing and since the developer don't care of the popular reception, will continually to dig a grave for this game.",0

4707,"don't let steam hours fool you, i've been playing this since beta on the normal client. i literally downloaded this on steam just to throw my two cents in: i'll just say this: if you enjoy other mobas, you'll most likely enjoy smite. that being said, the game is undergoing a major shift, and the developers are jumping ship. they're going from hi-rez-example employee name to titan-example employee name. this is being used to distinguish between the two groups of hirez. one is project titan, and the other is simply hirez. you can expect the eventual dropping of the original devs, to the new ones. half of the problems that the game is currently facing, is due to inconsistency. i'll explain: most players, whether they're new or old, can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent. this being that you can queue for a match, and if you're lucky enough to get in, and not you are unable to be matched, and are now the highest queue) which literally resets your queue for another - minutes. if you're lucky to get in, you'll see one of two things; one or multiple people on your team that are exceedingly low-level, and shouldn't be in your games, or one or more enemies that are low-level, and shouldn't be in your games. either way, it's simply not enjoyable. rofl-stomping some poor guy thats a low-level, when he shouldn't be in your game, isn't fun for anyone. it's not fun for him, and it's not fun for me. and it actually has a high chance of running new players away.match-making inconsistency is more often than not, the cause for player-frustration: i've been playing since the beta, and i'm burned out. i played literally games in a row, and literally had trash players on my team, that threw the game. i should never be paired with less than 's, that's sloppy match-making. playing with friends should be fun: i've played countless hours with friends, and one design flaw remains; whomever queues for the game, and is the party leader, rules the match-making. i'm normally the party leader, and we typically get players between -, aside from the low-levels we get teamed with. and while this is fine, we have a few players that are new, and have difficulty keeping up with players that are +. so to remedy this, we'll have our low-level player host, and queue for matches, and thats where it becomes apparent that the match-making is literal trash. because if he queues the party, we go up against players that are his level, not mine. hirez claims that the match making takes the cumulative level of the party, and match-making-rating, and queues them with the players closest to themselves. well we just proved that's . so now we're in a game with players under , and i'm . so i have two options; i can rofl-stomp these low-level players, or i can hang back, and let them experience the game. i don't want to throw the game for us, but i don't want to be that player, thats farming lowbies. that's not fun for anyone, and i want the player base to keep growing, not shrinking. god/class favoritism is rampant: you can clearly see which gods/classes are favored more than any of them, just by looking at the numbers. there are currently gods; out of those , there are mages, assassins, hunters, warriors, and guardians. mages are the most overpowered, and thusly the most played. there are mages that are so ridiculous, you can't close the gap, to actually get to them. this can be seen with gods like ah puch, discordia, baron, nox, zeus, vulcan, etc. it's exceedingly rare that mages are bad. however, there are many gods that are simply in a terrible state, such as ratatoskr, pele, artio, terra, jing wei, nike, osiris, etc. part of this issue, is that hirez balances gods strictly around conquest, their main mode. the funny thing is, most people don't play conquest, they play arena, and assault. to this end, the game is unbalanced, severely. you jump into an assault, which is a v with random gods across the board, and you fight an ah puch, you're basically screwed. he can keep more pressure on you, than most players can get around. if your team doesn't get a mage, you're basically screwed. gods like pele, are fantastic, in conquest. she's designed to be a jungler, and is the current best jungler out. that being said, on any other mode besides conquest, she's utter trash. this is part of a major problem for smite, balancing the game for a mode that most people don't play (as admitted too by hirez execs) doesn't work. it leads to people quitting due to frustration, when all they want to do, is play the damned game, and have fun, which is what games are supposed to be.smite is literally flooded with t cosmetics, that do nothing but take space in chests, to prevent you from actually getting the skin you want. you have god skins ward skins avatars loading frames pedestals social emotes recall skins hud themes loading screen backgrounds jump stamps fountain skins level-up skins death marks titles music themes announcer packs vgs voice packsand you can bet yourthat all of these are filled the the brim with absolute trash that you don't want, but is just there as filler for chests. hirez is incredibly greedy, and literally throws cosmetics in the way, to make you spend more gems(real world money) onyou don't want, just so you can maybe get the skin you want. i can't prove it, but i'm certain that chests are rigged, so you only get the good skins at the end of the chests. to put it simply, if you pay gems for one chest rolls, you'll most likely get and seeing as there are mostly items in one chest, you're going to be shelling out aton of money just to maybe get the skin you want. this needs to be changed. the sheer greed of hirez shows in literally everything they do. these are only a few of the problems: there are so many bugs, and issues in this game, it's absolutely insane. in it's current state, i would not recommend anyone plays this, unless you're interested in sub-par games, and shoddy matches.",0

4426,"winning or losing is entirely determined by your connection error, or rather the server's connection which is so flimsy it could go either way. the game lags and has a lot of talking npcs and unncessary click steps yet has a timer. which means they must've intended the game not to be played as yugioh, but as a completely arbitrary gamble and the yugioh cards are there for aesthetic and to trick idiots into buying gems.overall it is more balanced than real yugioh, but that's because real yugioh is everything you should not do in a card game. with so much dependent on first hand cards, spells/traps only existing as complimentary utility, and a lot of power creep from set to set, it wasn't hard to make this game at all more competitive by just tightening the board and changing set rotation down to hand selected cards that aren't all that good in the real format. what this is, is yugioh where they only correct their own bad game design by limiting cards that broke the real game as either extraordinarily rare (again, to trick idiots) and leaving the meta complete hogwash because of consistency constraints and tight board management making a lot of archetypes obsolete.yugioh as a game is all about the rareity and power creep of a card, so in essence this fixes that by makingservers that run on a atari and insuring most players never even see the really broken stuff they've made over the years. but if you're expecting to duel hardcore, make friends, do really anything besides wait around for the server to crash and get a loss for it... you'll need to play another card game. which i can't even recommend to you one because the industry is just so unconcerned with improvement and actually in-depth gameplay they're all just as bad. if i could give it a rating instead of just a recommendation i'd rate it two stars because it's like some evil genie wish of technically fixing yugioh, but in the most contrived way possible. it's like these programmers work harder to aggravate and troll than they do making a game.",0

8350,"in this review i'm mainly going to focus on the freeplay/paywin aspect of the game.i'm writing this as reaction to all the misinformation and outright bull*** spread around by clueless inviduals who gave up on the game the second someone with better gear made them feel inferior to the core, resulting in them calling neverwinter paywin ever since.let me state it right off the bat. there's nothing, and i mean nothing in this game that can't be obtained by just playing - and it doesn't even take crazy long to get your character into elite gear either.but you're not limited to just weapons and armor - all cosmetics, mounts, pets, literally everything is at your disposal without spending a penny.the game features a currency exchange system between astral diamonds (the game's primary currency, among others also used by auction house, where you can get pretty much everything) and zen (premium currency used in zen store, aka cash shop).there's no limit to how much you can exchange and you can do it both ways, so once you start running epic dungeons or find any other way to earn ad, you can get yourself whatever your heart desires, leaving your wallet untouched.so it's all up to you. sure, you can spend cash to speed up your progress in getting things if you want, but it's most definitely not a necessitty. i've never spent a cent myself, yet all my characters are in the ultimate gear, riding the fastest mounts, and it's not a rare sight that i get called a casher by people who don't know their way around the game yet and blindly believe you can't get the best stuff without paying. those are the same people who eventually ditch the game and end up writing zomg pw reviews over here in their bliss ignorance.tl;dr: if you don't mind spending some (reasonable) time working towards your gear, improving it piece by piece, you won't have any problems getting your characters anything you might like, without spending cash. i believe that's one of the things that rpg's are about after all, making your character more powerful as you progress through the game.if you just want to have the best stuff handed to you for free without spending time (or money), well then look for a different game. and good luck with that too.with this out of the way, it's time for some pros and cons.pros-as mentioned, a solid freeplay model that doesn't require you to spend money at all-six classes, each of which can be built and played in a number of ways, offering a completely different experience-i want to say enjoyable and entertaining gameplay and combat system, but that's highly subjective, so you best see for yourself.-a lot of lore if that's your thing-very good visuals-there are new short-term events coming up every few weks, usually in the form or a time-limited skirmish event (for instance call to arms: defend the temple is active right now), or a chance of valuable event items dropping form any mobs you kill for a couple of days-there are also neat seasonal events that last about a month, like summer festival and winter festival, with a lot of stuff to do for fun or decent rewards-new content being constantly added, altho the rate of large content updates (so called modules) is a tad low.-a large scale of gear and transmutation items that, along with dyes and dye packs, let you give your character a unique lookcons-endgame content is still slightly lacking, especially in the pvp department. however, it's being worked on, there's been a rather large pvp update two weeks back and even more stuff is on the way in the incoming module .-ever since the shards merged, the game tends to be a bit laggy from time to time. just for the record, the server is located in the us and live in europe.a few notes:-noticed some people complaining about bots. i haven't seen a single bot in lvl pvp in months. the only bots i ever see are the ones spamming zone chat with website links, and those you get used to easily. i basically don't even perceive them anymore.-i have minimal experience with dnd, so i can't comment on the game in that regard.",1

4400,"so when i played yu-gi-oh legacy of the duelist last year, i found it pretty crap, the multiplayer duels didn't really feel fun, the campaign was just ripped straight out of the anime and it was definitely not worth £ with dlc that adds up to around £-£. as for this game... well i saw ads for it in early , it wasn't exactly something that made me wanna play the game... the ad was some year old men saying cringy things, didn't look like yu-gi-oh, looked like a fan movie of yu-gi-oh. either way, november and here we are with the pc port of yu-gi-oh duel links, ported straight from the mobile! :d currently in the game you can play as characters from the original series and the gx series, i really hope next year they add something for yu-gi-oh d's as it's gonna be its th anniversary, but for now there's a lot to do as these characters. you start off with either yugi or kaiba, which is... a really weird choice isn't it? the most popular characters straight away? shouldn't they be like final bosses or something? well either way, you come across yugi's friends such as tea, joey, pegasus (not exactly his friend but y'know) and some others which i haven't gotten to myself. you duel them and unlock them, you don't have to just duel these guys, you can duel people online or random ai people. eventually you will unlock a new world which allows you to play as jaden yuki, the protagonist from gx, you can then unlock chazz, alexis and probably the rest of jaden's friends throughout the gx series. they better put something for d's at some point, i mean it would equal a lot more playtime for a lot of people and it would probably get more people interested in playing the game.the gameplay is like any other yu-gi-oh game, you place monsters, spells, traps, fusion summon, tribute summon, synchro summ- nvm you can do everything but that last one. except this time you only get card slots, for monsters, for traps/spells... what the hell? this can't be because its a mobile game, because yu-gi-oh duel generation has the regular slots ( for monsters, for spells/traps) but this one limits that... weird... also, i don't understand why the life points were reduced to instead of like in all the other games... was it to make duels quicker? because sometimes they can end really quickly if you know what you're doing, or if you're against ai... and duels can end in seconds with the auto-duel feature you'll eventually achieve, which plays the game for you... is it fun? not really, its funny for the first couple of duels, but its not exactly useful, if you need to get to another stage and you need to use specific cards, you should probably not auto duel. i did make a negative review for this game before, but that was before i actually started playing for real and after playing it... while it is annoying that there's only slots and there's a bunch of daily login mobile pop-ups (which btw should not be in a pc game) its still a decent game, you can transfer data from your mobile version to the pc so if you've played it since it came out, you should probably do that it'll save you the hassle of doing everything all over again. if you want to play a good yu-gi-oh game on pc you should definitely try this, its a bit boring at the start and has a really slow beginning but it eventually becomes addicting, especially if you have friends who constantly wanna duel you.",1

1274,"if you haven't already downloaded this game, you are missing out on something magical. almost everything (except certain exclusive skins) is unlockable through gameplay; and what's more, you're not going to grind for days just to get one ship or an upgrade. i play for - hours a night and have bought a ship, upgrades for my stock ships, cards, all kinds of stuff. all from my in-game credits.that said, so far the additional cards and weapon mods don't really give players a specific edge, more like situational bonuses. i usually pilot a reaper. the reaper is fast and has a ot of munitions, but it's definitely built for medium-range combat, and has a specific purpose of being a sniper killer. i can change my weapons so they do more damage to heavy hulls, or fire quicker to with less damage to protect ymself from lighter ships, and let my beam weapon do the talking on biger ships. the reaper gets a shield that protects its behind so that those attacking you as you pass them can't do as much damage. i can augment that so that it will protect me all over for a short period of time, or change it to top and bottom instead of behind. there's no augment available for my weaponry where i gain superlasers that deal massive damage with pinpoint accuracy, or shields that can soak massive damage all over. everything is situational, and that's awesome because it really means that merit is based on skill and not on cash spent. in fact, even if you unlock all ships, buy a bunch of platinum, etc, you'd still have to learn each one. think about unlocking every single champion in lol. you'd never play through all of them, and even if you did you'd never be awesome with all of them. now, outside of all of the fp drama of the current gaming generation, this game is solid. i feel like i'm piloting a spaceship; your ship is slow, and yet there's moments where everything is over too fast. there hasn't been a game where either side was steamrolled, and lots of times where a team has come back from the brink because of poor planning on the opponents' part. communication is vital here. there's no such thing as carrying your team. either you work together or you lose, and there are certain comps that strengthen this. there is no ship that can take a sector by itself; double kills are things of amazement. the aesthetic is just amazing. the first cinematic shows the ship up close and you really get a sense of scale for these things. it really sticks with you as you picture the battles from the cockpit. i actually really wish they'd allow for a cockpit view so you could watch this mountain of a spaceship fire a plasma ball at you the size of a skyscraper.literally my only complaint is for more maps and play types. the maps switch up, there's different styles of sector you can jump to (some are asteroids, some are long skinny rocks, some are more empty than others, etc), but i'd like to see different layouts. i think a capture the flag mode would be excellent.",1

15208,"hello steam community it great to meet you all, thank you for taking the time to gaze at my review. frist off, i start by saying after playing well over . hours of robocraft, i come to a turning point. the crativity that once made the game enjoyable has become sadly ended in my own option. no more will you see duck or boat, or even cute anime robots. the choice to jump on to a loot based game system left a bad taste.i really try to embrace the new changes. but time and time agian the move to a a more competitive tournaments style of gaming to me rune the beauty the game once had.i really do love the the ideal the game give, i love to be ceative. building a robots in robocraft was once rewarding, i use to enjoy battleing and come across someone who would creative with there own robots battle mine, notice funny than seeing a hat waring duck battle a big piggy, but you dont see anything like that now.most matches are now all competitive tournament robot are build for only one idea to win loot crates to get the best weapons & armor.when i was at about hrs into robocraft i started to notice the change. but the last few changes i hope things would return to a playable game, but sadly the introduction to loot crate, have only reward people who have enough spare time and money to buy them, it make the game feel cheep. feel like a cash grabing tactic in my own opinion.if you new player, you're robots are only going ot be meat for the higher level players with the best weapons and armor. but that being siad. the game still offer enjoyable gaming for competitive players. but if you just want to be creative player then sady this is not the game for some people.talking aobut what i liked and dislike about the game has all change. becuase this is not the same game i played when i frist started playing robocraft, with before there tier system you had balance, with the exponential scale in robocraft that determines how strong a robot was, and what other robots it could battle, but now with the matches base on cpu favior poeple who buy loot crates to who then make lower cpu robots with extramly powerful weapons witch then in my opion then rune experince.i also sadly if you had ask me a year ago to recommend the game i would have, but becuase of overtiering and introduction to loot crates system, having to pay primum monthly jsut for extra pant colors, really under vaule the game. so with a vary heavy hart i must sadlly un-recomend this game to anyone who think the game offer crativty and fun enjoyable gamming. and only ...*sighs*... recomment this for people who are competitive tournament player types.",0

17201,"brain cells died playing this game. i hate it.here's why:saturday, april th i was looking for some steam games, and i found this. i loved how to train your dragon and , and even the netflix mini-series. i thought it would be a decent game, after seeing the good reviews, (i only see the bad reviews after getting the game, for some reason) and, after all, its only $. (+ over $. in in-game content).the first thing you notice when you turn on the game is that you made some pretty bad life choices. the second thing you notice is that you are already praying for god to have mercy on your soul. the third thing you is when you get to play the game, you need to make an account, or you get named viking so i made an account, and i chose the name pingas. and it said it had symbols. really? ok. i can live with that. named my character buttergamer in homenage for pbg. the game wouldn't let me name it that way cuz' it had the word butt in it.finnaly got to the game aaand... wasted minute and . seconds waiting for the game to load. aaand... wasted another minute cuz the game was downloading stuff. aaand finaly got to play the game. what i saw was atrocious. the quality of the graphics were terrible. i mean... this game was made in and even still, it looks like the graphics were made by an year old learning how to make a game, or this game was made with the same program the gamecube games were made.the genious that made this game decided not to give any collision detection to some of the npc characters (and sometimes, you fall under the floor).after that, i justoff and uninstalled it. wait, you can fly as toothless?/ best game",0
1878,"the game in itself is technically remarkable as the mechanics are brilliant and you could have fun with it for a lifetime.the community however is toxic - humankind at its worst.most matches your teammates will disconnect as soon as the other team gains the lead which is pathetic, this is common practice online but on dota it reaches new highs.when are not busy clicking the disconnect button, these lovely folks (instead of playing the bloody game) spend their time insulting you for whatever reason - it's common taking at female characters which is lovely, sometimes right at the beginning of the match for no apparent reason whatsoever other than probably them being complete dumbasses.it's particularly sad that this happens playing unranked matches, years away from even being able to attempt a competitive match. i can't even begin to imagine the environment when things start getting serious.it was a better experience praticing with bots as machines demonstrated better team spirit and they acted in a much more civilized fashion. if you are into trolling and flaming, insanely competitive playing, or if you are a sociopath, this is the game for you.otherwise just avoid it like the plague. at the end this game is nothing but a glorified tower defense click click click waste of time anyway.",0

15575,"before anyone says oh it's in early access, you shouldnt judge it so harshly early access isn't armour for criticism, plus i'm sure the people at artix have their big boy pants on and can take a crticism or two.firstly, why am i playing an android/ios mmo on my pc?at this point artix should have the money to make a decent d mmo, at least on the level and scale of world of warcraft or guild wars . (they may not be good examples, but the point still stands)so why are they making an mmo for mobile devices? granted it's a lucrative market at this point, but why then release it on pc? they could have just released it on the play store and itunes, released updates, and just have it make money where it should.secondly, why does the game look terrible? like it looks worse than runescape! and thats saying something!i ask that question, but then i remember they are making a mobile game...for the pc...it's not stylised in a way that would hold up either, it just generally looks bad, like ps early days of polygon sprites bad.finally, and this can be pointed to it being in early access, but there are lots of other early access games that passed this hurdle, the gameplay is completely un-inspired and pointless, you have a total of skills for each class and of them is always the auto attack, there is no variation to it and overall it leaves me bored, i'm not expecting it to make any big waves, but even the original aq holds up better than this.in conclusion, it's a boring, ugly, lame excuse for a pc port of what has been done several times over, a hundered times better on mobile devices.",0

11877,"hello all this is my opinion of the game. take what i say into consideration before purchasing this game. week - major issues was happening not anything new to a new mmo launch. fixed pretty quick to say the least apart from other mmo's i have played.week - was ok i believe pvp started up got to experience it and wasnt bad but some classes were op and considering this game is focused on pvp. it didnt meet alot of players expectations but pvp is hard to balance but pvp was the only end game there.week -- devs kicked half if not all emissarys some deserved to be kicked and some didnt. emissarys are post to give feedback positive or negative, if the dev team cant communicate to emissarys then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it was executed right. gameplay- i thought the gameplay was smooth although huge fps problems for alot of people including me i felt optimization could of been better for a early access game that was mostly done just a few minor fixes here and there but that was not the case.combat- was ok kinda felt clunky even switching stances felt clunky to me. combat was a slow/fast pace mix when using skills but overall pretty fun.taming- brillant idea that i hate to see go to waste loved this aspect of the game. you could capture anything just about in the game. hope to see other mmos use this idea but make it even better although idk how you could make it even better haha. crafting- it was simple i liked that not really into lifeskills that much dungeons- were pretty difficult after a few patches but the loot was meh even for the last dungeon.this game failed because of poor communication from devs, youtubers who only play to lvl , and so forth. but i can not recommend this game in its current state. i hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it. took to big of a hit.",0

(except the one that is coming out on ptr) i personally don't want this seasonal bs before the core game is ready. and it is not. which infuriates me. i payed euros for this in kickstarter. boy do i regret it. and since aqw became absolutely terrible after lords of chaos, my only safe haven is dragonfable. don't you dare to ruin that one too ae!!! leave tomix and his team alone!!! let them create an actually good and interesting story and world!!! not that you have done anything to it, yet! aqd has made me almost hate the company that i used to love. a lot! but oh boy!! it's all almost hate these days. i do not recommend this game. don't buy the dcs, don't buy anything related to this game. make them finish the features that were promised first! don't let them release these seasonal money grabs and let them think that we don't remember the things that were promisd to us. oh, and did you know they receives over k to develop this game... i'm offically done with this game, and will not be returning before it is the game that was advertised to us on kickstarter. it's been years! whole years!!! saying that my and the community's patience has ran out is an understatement!!! do not waste your money or time on this game or company. make the developers actually improve their practises before you start investing in them. aqd has been the worst investment i have done in my life. and it will most likely stay that way until people smarten up and let this game die away, like it should at this moment.in short, congratulations ae. you made someone who loved you, hate you with fiery passion.

15021,"firstly, there are > hours of non-steam play time.alright, robocraft was a great game back in . your goal was extremely simple - build anything you want, arm it with some (or many) lasers and fight! the battles were extremely dynamic though being simple - drive to the map center and fight to death! despite there were times less modules the customization was much bigger. why? there were no ultimate machines - even a car with four wheels and a pair of guns could pwn.also, there were only light, heavy, glass chassis blocks and armor levels, nowadays there are no armor cubes (robocraft degrades too, lol).when did it all started? when the plasma was added. it was the first op-thing to be implemented. bombers ruled the battles, people who could build a spin-bomber (plasma could only be placed on the top of the block at this time) were the robocraft kings. but that didn't stopped me. i've continued building my gunbeds (phoenix, titan and lapis tanks, eh, old times).after some time the railguns were added and laser fire range was fixed - it came to be infinite. it was the peak of robocraft. the best times.then.. it started to degrade.more modules led to the overpowered bombers and drones. anything land-based could be destroyed in a single plasma strike. but to make things worse, freejams have added the repair cost. and that was the worst time in robocraft.you just simply couldn't use anything above tier (yeah, there were tiers and robo ranking) without premium, so robocraft was claimed pay-to-win for that. one unlucky battle could erase your money from the past lucky battles.i've nearly not played robocraft at this time - it wasn't attractive for me.repair costs were deleted, later.and then robocraft started to degrade at full force.megabots weren't so cool as we thought.new weapons were too useless or too overpowered. overpowered guns have been later fixed and now they are useless too.the game has been too simplified. no tech points anymore, for example.community robot factory was the second biggest mistake.. no, it's the first biggest (repair costs are the second) mistake fjs have ever done. the coolest aspect of robocraft, building, was zeroed.and what do we see now? no money anymore. crf overpowered bots everywhere. anything hand-made is unplayable.weapon switch. energy. sec regeneration. auto-aim guns. hours to make a single gun.finally, cases? is it just me who thinks that sandbox game shouldn't use the randomness?so-o, that's robocraft, degraded and simplified. it could be a great game, with its great potential.. but freejams have chosen a wrong way. if you still want to play it - try, but it doesn't worth my time anymore.thesol out.",0

7915,"people often say that the only way to get anywhere in the game is to just pay to win which is just a lie. yes there is the occasional pay to win players who say oh its so good just pay the or $ but if you have ever playd good old d&d online you would know that you can do everything for free with just time. you can get zen with standard astral diamonds or ad for short with just a little time spent grinding just by running one character to lvl with some side quests and pvp here and there i get about -k ad after bying a mount from the auction house for about -k. depending on how much ad zen is worth at the time iv seen zen for about ad per zen and when you add it up thats , ad, just running one character to lvl not trying to get ad i make about half of that. now i know what your thinking well what can zen get me? to be honest not very much however there is a easy way of makeing ad like crazy once you make a little zen from grinding. its called vip, vip at rank one gives you % bonus to xp/glory (pvp)/and professions, vip zone access to moonstone mask, % bonus ad on daily quests in protector's enclave , level appropiate identification scrolls , and one free enchanted key perday. encahnted keys is where you make the ad, you get enchanted lock boxes every where i mean there like dirt i swear, so everyday of vip ( days) you open a box and you sell what you get on the auction house untill you have enough for another month of vip and trust me you will. once you have enought for vip what ever amout of keys you have left is yours to do what ever with. so in theory you can do everything in this game for free with just a little bit of effort.",1
8391,"neverwinter is a pretty standard cryptic mmo in that everything about the game is incredibly mediocre. the game isn't your typical hotkey mmo - you instead have only a handful of abilities at any given time. because of the lack of keys i found combat to be very boring and repetive, but for people that don't really like the bazillion and one things to remember it may be a good thing. i personally wasn't a fan of it.a lot of assets are reused as well. for levels i found myself fighting the same types of enemies in the same types of enviornments, and story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. very little of the source material is actually important, the game is essentially a self-contained story and even simple things like the city of neverwinter itself is built from the ground up to be unique, so people like myself that played baldur's gate, neverwinter nights etc. really have nothing to look forward to in terms of revisiting these locations.classes are very bare-bones right now, and while variety is well enough, it doesn't even begin to compare to the kinds of options neverwinter nights and baldur's gate players are used to. the die rolling character sheet on character creation exists, but it doesn't feel like actual dice rolling. it seems as though cryptic made it so there are several chances you can get and the game just flips between them to simulate you're rolling your stats. i spent maybe ten minutes re-rolling to get an unoptimal roll and it simply never happened. my highest numbers were always on my classes two highest stats, with one or two points favoring one statistic over the other. i never managed to get really high charisma on a fighter, for example.the biggest comparison i can make to the combat system is tera. the game has an active style attack and offense system in place, but for the most part i experienced no challenge whatsoever in a solo enviornment. in groups all of the content i experienced was trivial (especially in raids etc.). maybe this changes as you get higher into the game, but i spent my levels bored out of my mind and completely uninterested in what was going on story-wise. if you're new to mmos in general, i think you will have a lot of fun, however. it strays far enough from the wow-clone formula to be appealing in my opinion, but at the same time it doesn't take any huge liberties with gameplay mechanics or... anything else, for that matter, to really justify choosing to play this over the plethora of other mmos that are available. cryptic's use of the license is just pathetic, really. apart from seeing neverwinter in dialogue or on the map i was convinced that this was just another generic d&d inspired gameworld. when it comes to is it actually free to play? i found the game to be pretty fair compared to other experiences i've had with this genre. at no time did i feel like paying for something would make the game easier, nor did i feel it was necessary to progress. with the research i did (i didn't spend dozens of hours on forums or google so take this as a subjective opinion) the vast majority of things in the game that could be bought for real money were mostly convienence items. more bag space, faster mounts, armor/clothing cosmetics, that sort of thing. the game is using cryptic's infamous lockbox system, however. and the middle of my screen was essentially permafilled with so-and-so opened a box and got steaming pile of dung so if you're not a fan of that type of marketing then beware that this game is very bad about that.in terms of content i found that the game was somewhat lacking. crypic's mission creator system i experienced from star trek online is present here, and it seems as though it's essentially been copy & pasted. this i found to be both good and bad. good in the sense that there are really creative players out there that are doing cryptic's job for them, bad in the sense that when anybody complains there isn't enough content most retorts will be then play community-made content. the missions i played by players were varied, and while i never tried to make any missions myself, if the mission variety is any indicator, then cryptic's tool is very versatile and seems to get the job done well enough.with that being said, it brings me around to my least favorite aspect of this game: the dailies. at an incredibly early level (approx. level ten) you are introduced to daily quests. if you're not familiar with daily quests, they are essentially very basic, oftentimes simple (but time consuming) quests that can be done on a timer (typically to hour period cooldowns). in neverwinter the dailies revolve around pvp and player-made content. once the initial new feeling wears off (just as any other mmo) the dailies become monotonous and tedius. the rewards are fairly bad as well, and never motivated me to invest a lot of time to complete them. overall i was very disappointed in this game, and cryptics consistency with creating average mmos that adhere to a very strict formula. being big into neverwinter nights i was continually let down with this game's lack of story and of license use, and in general the safe way cryptic approached yet another mmo. even more so since it lacks the sort of exploratory freedom of star trek, and the creative freedom of character of champions online. this game is a middleground to both of those games and as a result i feel it suffers for it. for the reasons listed above i simply can't (and won't) recommend this game to anybody but those that are extremely tolerant and/or accepting of the standard mmo business that has become so mainstream. and for those that are d&d enthusiasts, my advice, from one d&d fan to another, move along; there's nothing to see here.",0

3664,"currently the game is awful. it lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. quickplay is gone. it's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called casual. it's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. dosn't help that the queue times are god awful as well. i managed to watch entire sgbplay mario party videos, which are about : hours long each, before entering a single match of badwater that lasted about minutes. and in those minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of morgan freeman, or the team hoovy/spycrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. hell, even the lenny/bind spammers are gone. this simple move has taken all the character and charm tf had andall over it.next is the balancing. this game has horrible balancing. especially since valve doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. only listening to the competitive players. people like bnny and mr.slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by valve, and to what has that opinion led? phlog buff of smissmass and caber nerf of summer . two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the phlog became the walk and die weapon of the century. this update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. come on, who was complaining about the buffalo steak sandvich!? who complained enough to say it needed a nerf!? next is the communication. valve communicating with the community, what a pipedream. they never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. at most we get the ocassional neato in the sub-reddit. and why you might ask? because the tf team is people who don't care/give aabout their own game. overwatch was released, one would expect valve to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with heavy vs pyro, which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. if valve simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. most of the tf community would be happy knowing that valve didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. and finally, my biggest gripe with tf currently, it's more personal and i know i'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of mac support. i run tf on mac, which some might call , but at least i run tf at fps. well would run it. the game is in such a state where the mac support died off about months ago. the game constantly crashes with the error out of memory or because the game failed to load a single texture. not to mention the game loads textures one at a time. for mac users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. so for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to hours on fort alone. also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the retriving server info part of the loading screen. i'm not sure if windows/linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the mac to crash in some way or another. there's even been instances where my entire computer, not just tf, but all of it crashed due to tf failing to load me in. the last true patch mac ever got was about year ago in gun mettle, where valve did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? this is a tf only issue, gmod runs fine, cs:go runs fine, but tf doesn't. the game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. doesn't even feel valve is the one making the game anymore. it feels like ea or god-fobid ubisoft took the wheel with this game.",0
14558,"product received for freethis game crashes. a lot.why, i have to admit, this new epic loot update is great... for the first hour or two if it's your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumby ones you get the very first time you play the game. though once you get over how amazing that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is, you'll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish, especially since you have to buy premium to get half of what's in the crates anyways. this crate system can be seen one of two ways; either pay-to-win, or getting on your knees and praying to the rng gods that, once, just once, you'd get an epic item from your protonium crate. also here's a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone; i found a stinkin' legendary item in a bronze crate, but i needed premium to have collected it (the same thing happened to my friend, but with a different item). speaking of big guns, they are litterally all you need to excel at this game. i build a pflop tank, and it loses to some tiny bot, % of which is a single gun. seriously? i could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship. i guess not. but who am i trash talk micro-bots. i built one myself, and i can get kills in a single deathmatch with it (most of the time building goes into where i should put more hoverblades). finally, this game crashes. a lot. though most of the time, it seems to happen when i finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well. what a coincedence...-- edit: it's been a while and there have been many big changes to robocraft so i feel that my review could use an update too. first off; my thoughts on the fast and formidable update. as a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts, i enjoyed having the ability to build a pflop (maximum value) robot. although quite a few robocraft veterans would disagree, i think this update was a small step in the right direction. i could build as i please, but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot. but this brawl update. this brawl update is no fun. freejam has decided to (instead of listening to the community) remove multiple game modes, and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the brawl mode. this would have been fine if they did it like overwatch and just added a brawl as a new game mode, but no. though at this point, i'd be a fool to be surprised when freejam disappoints the community.",0

(google this for more info). the game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyimao:. honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.. deck sizes should be increased to minimum. card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the fp ultra rare card discrepancy.. i could list more serious problems caused by konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things i hate the most about the game.in closing, if i see one more fully loaded blue eyes deck i'm going to vomit!",0

8435,"this review is based on approximately hours of interupted game-play. considering it is free to play i'll be cautious about my reservations about this game, so here goes:uber:- decent selection of character races & classes- has a glowing-sparkly trail of prettiness that you can choose to show which leads you to your next objective- fast sense of progression, your character obtains new skills and abilities regularly which keeps it interesting- some ability graphics look really goodmeh- physics graphics are cheesy - players run with an odd motion- interacting with objects or npc's can be tedious as you need to 'interact' with f key which can be buggyjust...no- very linear when not in town - always a set path- early level game mechanics are highly favourable to the player (overpowered) and although that can be fun sometimes i found it made the beginning of the game bat-turd boring. overall it seems to be trying to follow the game play mechanics of world of warcraft but without the cartoon graphics. as an avid dungeons & dragon's fan i was hoping for more with character creation but i appreciate how it can become daunting if over complicated.overall it's a decent free to play game but i wouldn't spend money on it.",1

8289,"if you like dungeons and dragons or fantasy rpg's and mmo's, you might want to give this a try for the first ten levels. it's kind of fun for about that long, until the payment scheme sets in and you realize how hard it's going to be to continue on improving your gear and such without spending actual money. i spent real money on cryptic/pwe's star trek online, and if you've played any of their games before this isn't anything much different in terms of paying for flash mostly. as a general rule, i don't spend much money on these games unless they really appeal to me in some way. ironically, this game is much better than sto in all the ways you'd want and expect it to be, but in the end, i wasn't moved enough to want to spend any money on this world. the neverwinter backdrop is there still, but it's so different from the neverwinter i remember that it seems little more than an heir in name alone. this could be any fantasy world. i enjoyed my character's special abilities, but meh. give it a try, you might feel differently. i can't say much about advanced game content or what you actually get after spending real cash--the difference it makes and all. no great surprises here, good or bad. due to security concerns over pwe's failure to properly secure customer information and their failure to notice a major incursion and/or notify the public in a timely fashion, i wouldn't purchase anything from them directly. ever. will steam fall? not will, but when... but why spread your information around in more places than necessary? that's my two cents. enjoy.",1

9487,"pay to win, pay to win, pay to win... waa waa waa, seems taht's all people say about this game. my question is, when exactly does this game end and you win? what the hell are you guys talking about? this game never ends and your not battling against other players so... yeah. here's the deal, you do have to pay but only for chests for your character to keep loot. how many is completley up to you and at $ a pop, it can get pricey. i, myself, have only have about chests. paying for weapons, armor, speacial attacks and other crap is only if your an impatient punk (no offense to anyone just my opinion). never purchased any of that and i've done fine ...kinda ha! one more charcter slot will help out too. another charcter not in use can also double as a makeshift chest. see, i'm an old school gamer, definetly played gauntlet on the nes more than this game. thats another thing that got me with this game, kind of a modern gauntlet but played online. so having that background and just the type of gamer that i am, i don't mind the grind. the blood, sweat and tears type most people will just start the game, try to rush in, die and say this game sucks when in reality its quite the oppisite. you can not, i repeat, you can not just rush into this game. it takes time to really get to know the enimies and their tactics. not to mention the types of areas in the game and how to play as the character type your using. characters: i'm not gonna get too into the types and stuff but just run it down simple. alot of people are impatient and just want to go head first into evrything. you cant... unless your a tank/battle type character. knights, warriors and paladins are the type thats more up close and personal. bottom line, you have a sword type weapon, up close and personal. staff or bow, keep your distance. this does have some variances with character types. remeber this and you wont die ... as much ha! death: you die, thats it. its fustrating and horrible. lose your character, his/her level and everything it was carrying and start all over again after choosing another character (same class or not and whatever you have available via unlocking) realm itself: for beginners, you definetly want to stay on the outskirts of the map. the beaches and lightly wooded areas. the further/deeper you go, the harder it gets. pretty plane and simple, keeping it short and simple. character levels: it just goes up to level and thats it. when you first start getting to level can be challenging. once you reach pots collected in dungeons, dungeon bosses and certain other enemies can increase your stats as they're locked at lvl . you can also save them instead of consuming and use them as in-game currency. which leads to my last point... pots: this can be consumed to increase your current characters stats once they're at level (can be consumed before that tho, if you want, idk). they can also be saved (this is where those chests come in handy for sure) to be used with another character later in time. they can also be used as in-game currency to buy weapons and such. prices for these tend to change here and there (i go online to check current stats). so doing this, while does take some skill and time, can help to get things without buying them with real money. other stuff: pets and stuff... idk, figure it out. play the game. bottom line, it's a good game. just a modern, online gauntlet i think. pay to win, not really. only if you cant wait and don't want to do the grind. but then whats the fun, i ask. i feel better about starting from scratch and making personal. if you do want to buy weapoms and crap, i recommend waiting till your pretty familiar with the game and can get arounbd ok, that way you wont die right away and lose your thats pretty much it. dont forget to try different servers and switch thing up a bit. oh and not to mention this game does not require you to play any amount of time. i find it good to kill -min here and there.",1

9066,"planetside is a game that brings unprecedented fights that can scale to over players in a battle. as a massively multiplayer online first person shooter, this game is uniquely one of a kind. intense tactical squad play determines the winners of the battle. there may be dozens of tanks that roll over a hill to be met with hundreds of infantry of all classes prepared for a stand down. all the while aircraft hover the battlefield and drop missles and soldiers alike. all this happens in a vast continent that has fighting between three factions across the border of territory. some favorite classes are the infiltrator with invisibility, light assault with jetpacks, and maxs who battle in exosuits! not only this, but there are literally thousands of customizable playstyles that can be catered to one's playstyle. tanks, aircraft, and bases have many unique designs and serve many purposes. yet, all this belongs to the free to play game we know as planetside . against popular belief, planetside is not pay to win as spending money on weapons only unlocks a new variation of play (your default weapons are suited for all-round combat already). the graphics are amazing for a year old game. at night, players can see the sky light up with brilliant colors of explosions and firefights.this is a game that keeps veterans coming back, even after long breaks, which tells a lot about the game. give it a try, i promise it won't disappoint if you love realistic warfare scenarios!",1

8559,"tldr: started ranting or covering unimportant things. game has a few balance issues but is fun as mess otherwise. plus it's only been out days sohonestly suprised i liked this game. i tried fortnite out day of its release and moved on after or so games. it just wasn't that fun to me. thought this game would be similar but, oh boy was i wrong. this game has something.it's smooth almost all the time when it comes to frames and whatnot. it'll dip every now and then but that's about it. i got in an infinite fall once...and my movement abililty, that is on every class, got me out of it. that's solid foresight. a few times i've been in gun fights with people who seemed to be able to move extremely fast and stay locked on, but that might be some fortnight kids migrating. i'm just assuming there's no real hackers here yet. of course, there are laggers though. i think there's no oceania servers or something, but i didn't really care enough to look into it. assuming it was just some people on my server who shouldn't be there.the abilities are really cool. i thought it'd be a mechanic just tacked on, but it really adds to the fighting and chasing down people. there should probably be a way to read what levels do what and which abilities do what before having to go in game and test it out. every class's movement ability is interesting and have their own purpose, but i wouldn't say they're all good or even viable honestly. shocker that jumping directly into the air at a degree angle is not great in combat. obviously, a few abilities need to be buffed to keep up with the others but i truly think nothing needs to be nerfed except maybe max armor, doubling your life is kind of crazy ( arm - health)i could go on a little longer but i feel like i'm trying to convince a friend to get this game rather than leaving a review to help people. sorry about that.",1
14636,"everything has already been said imo. but to sum it all up: -low time to kill (doesn't really matter what you build, you'll die within a second anyway)-most movement parts feel very unresponsive and sluggish-hard counter against air (flak, missles)-no skill and auto aim weapons (ion, psk, missle launcher)-totally unusable smgs, which are supposed to be the jack of all trade weapons (inaccourate, crazy bloom and long bullet travel time)-everyone can now be a one man army, since you're allowed to add as many diffrent weapons as you like-top tier matches dominated by long range weapons (rail)-random loot crate drops are the only viable way to get new parts (only worthless parts noone would ever need, e.g. cosmetic masks, low tier stuff)robocraft is basicially like counter strike, but all hits are like instant headshots (with the exception of smgs) without even having to aim and sluggish movement (and therefore no way to actually dodge enemy fire). well, and you can customize the looks of your player model, i guess?i used to play this game a lot! i won't recomment this game to anyone anymore! in case you're insane and want to play rc anyways, don't use the steam version! i only had problems with it so far. i can't even get it to start anymore.",0

2544,"if you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with war thunder! every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for golden eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.the russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! this most experianced in the mode realistic battle where it's nation vs. nation and the russian nation has a win rate over % at ranks and over %! the rng for russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with shot becouse off op ammo (some ww tanks have post war ammo)!you really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the mm is one of the worst i've ever seen! it doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where / of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them. don't get me wrong the game was good at patch . (more than a year ago maybe ) but after that it just got worse! a lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates . and . where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!",0

6784,"(i have resumed playing the steam version)this game has the potential to be something great, it really does. unfortunately that potential is wasted.the balance in this game ispoor, mostly early on when you are just starting off. for tanks it is painful, especially for germany as you can be fighting light tanks from while driving a tankette from , a full decade behind. tanks with machineguns should only be fighting tanks with machineguns, otherwise they are goddamn useless. even later tanks are pretty badly up tiered, with an m lee, a tank from that only lasted until because it was obsolete the moment it was put into service, is fighting panthers, t--s and other tanks from . low tier tanks mostly involves being seal clubbed, that's all it is until you get lucky and fight stuff on your level or get a better tank. the grind is hilariously bad, you need to put in twice the time to get anywhere in terms of progression with equipment, and most of that as stated before is just getting seal clubbed a whole lot. credit income is very low and you have to pay for ammo and repairs for vehicles and weapons alike so that just makes it worse along with the ridiculous prices of stuff you need to buy. you pretty much have to buy veteran membership to progress without grinding for days on end, and that costs a lot of money. from what i have been hearing some people have been getting banned for cheating, when it's just a brokenanti-cheat system or a scam so people will make a new account and spend money on it to progress.short version, this game is terribly imbalanced and the devs need to get theirtogether and fix it becuase it's not getting any better. go ahead and try it, first few hours in you will realise how painful the grind is from the bottom. i'm not saying not to try this game, do try it, it has great potential and can be quite enjoyable at times, it just becomes painful to play rather quickly if you dont advance or get uptiered.",0

8373,"i am never a great fan of the th edition mechanics in dungeons and dragons but, neverwinter has managed to convience me that it works as an action rpg in a persistant mmo setting.neverwinter is strongly based on the neverwinter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy mmorpg gameplay together with fresh tried and tested approach from star trek online and champions online.while i am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like granado espada and maple story, cryptic's unique approach of astral diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players. however, i do question the motive and causality of making astral diaminds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place.another feature borrowed from cryptic's other games, is the introduction of the foundary. a virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy. there are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players.this feature is powerful enough to recreate entire dungeon and dragon modules written for table top play to exist in neverwinter.like star trek online, i am really cautious in approaching this game. at this stage, neverwinter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics. but cryptic has demostrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem dungeons and drangons in the mmorpg market.",1

694,"if you wanted to play free to play games, this one, don`t even bother playing it.this is a game where developer try to imitate counter-strike games but failed horriblely,and they dare to add the most useless, and unworthly microtransaction. only they selling is just a skin.skin that i mention is skin of a gun, emblems, and of course masks.thats it? thats what you can do on the microtransaction? super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $. each?so its complete useless microtransaction, so how about the game?its a gamemode only, skrimish, and elimination.skirmish is similar to team-deathmatch, only this here, is a bad skirmish game, elimination is idk vs idk counter-strike rip-off. balancing team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.guns are just a ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it fun to shoot at, here is zero fun. i didn`t enjoy at all, p why u too nub to shoot, shotgun, why u too op, m, why u shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. except shotgun, which is super effective.server is only in channels, where player need to join the channels room to play, but i found out this is very familiar.is this a developer from d blockade? server was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. for me, at least on asia. i probably realized this was hosted on russia. right. i also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?hackers, yeah. it has, but is it hackable without ban? yeah. no one give a damn about banning a person. you can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? no, no one will win if someone vote no on purpose of gaining winning. ban vac? who gives a shyt, no one get ban.graphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. there`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. its like incomplete release.and lastly, did i mention the game have leveling system... talk about the useless leveling system ever created? you gain exp by winning a game. so what it does for exp? nothing. yeah nothing. zero functionality in exp. except unlocking skin which requires you .$ to buy???seriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, i despite everything this game yet to offer. even though its free, you may thinking, free is the reason why you set yes as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, i feel like i need to play other game instead. i say a lot of free games like blackshot is even better than this, even a game like crazy shooter online is times better, this game isn`t. its just a garbage game.there`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. i just can`t, i just wanted more biceps for playing a shooter games. in the end, games sucks. go play other free game instead.(/)",0

14089,"*i have never heard of the new z before it coming out on steam and tried it out for the first time yesterday*first off i want to say this game is free. meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to reviews. you should play it and see if you like it or not.for a free game it's actually alright. there are no pay to win elements what so ever except being able to buy premium which is like unturned premium, yes you can buy meds and ammo for real life money, but you can also do so with ingame money which is easy to get. in my hours i have well over grand which is more than + dollars can buy.this game is mainly pvp, with meds that have cool downs to use during fight, barricades to block off bullets, and a sweet arcade feel for combat that is not realistic at all.killing zombies is quite rewarding as well and there is a skill gap in this game. you can find clans that go in together and run parts of the map on servers, so skilled gamers will enjoy this game.remember this isn't a survival game but a shooter with zombies, where you find loot like meds, armor, guns, etc. and then go to pvp. that's the whole game. but it is fun to play and free. all negative reviewers are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid or are rating this way to harshly.overall: / *fun to play with friends every now and then and free*",1

7983,"enjoyable in short bursts for a long time, i stopped playing nw because it was an unoptimized piece of grabo and cryptic werenâ€t all that interested in fixing it. iâ€ve returned after more than six months to nw and i gotta say itâ€s a pretty fun fp mmo, taken in small doses. the combat is fast paced and satisfying, plus after a longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥time the game is finally optimized and you can properly enjoy it (it should run at -fps on most pcâ€s even in more crowded areas).although itâ€s based on the forgotten realms d&d setting, this game is nothing like its tabletop counterpart (or neverwinter nights for that matter). nw is an action mmo through and through, your characters have no alignment to speak of, so you can choose whatever class you fancy without a worry in the world (except for the fact that some races work better for some classes). the voice acting is decent, the music is pretty good, graphics are acceptable (better than most fp mmoâ€s on the market), just donâ€t go into this game expecting the next big thing.if you are not willing to spend any money on this game, then i would suggest you stay away from pvp. as a non-paying player you wonâ€t be on equal footing with those that decide to pay for some cash shop items that make your life much easier (or those who have played aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton). as a side note, you are able to convert astral diamonds (a currency you get from different in-game activities) into zen (the premium currency, that can also be bought with your hard earned $) to buy stuff from the cash shop, but the rates arenâ€t all that great.another problem for free players is that we are limited to character slots per account, which is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the only way to get more is with zen (on the other hand, you can make and use as many free accounts as you like). whatâ€s more, races are locked behind game packs that go for , â‚¬ for the moon elf, , â‚¬ for the dragonborn and , â‚¬ for the menzoberranzan renegade (the packs also include some mounts, a char slot each and some otherâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥thatâ€s not all that useful).as for pve, itâ€s pretty entertaining, albeit repetitive. once you hit max lvl, your main goals are to obtain some artifacts and do the campaigns (which mostly consist of doing daily quests, getting some resources which youâ€ll use to research some passive skills for your character). the quests you do arenâ€t all that memorable, but at least they arenâ€t very long, so you wonâ€t have to spend too much time with â€˜em. recently theyâ€ve also introduced a system that makes the campaigns faster for an alt but i havenâ€t spent much time with it so i canâ€t say how much faster they really are.all in all, if you can look past its flaws (which are quite a few), nw is a pleasant way to spend your spare time mindlessly killing monsters and grinding some gear.",1

3371,"this game is, as a lot of people put it, pubg but better in literally every way. this review will mostly compare it to pubg, sol people who already play it and other games like fortnite/hz can know exactly how this is better and what's different/new to expect that you won't find in other battle royales. note that i've only got a few hours of game time but i've got dozens more on the beta summer map. pros:- it's free, you have literally zero excuse not to at least try it- weapons are better, attachments go onto your guns automatically and should you change weapons, the old attachments will automatically transfer to the new ones. more balance, no more instakill shotgunning people across the map.- only one map so far but it'll soon beat pubg in this as well with other maps planned, one most likely being the old beta map. everyone complaining about the new map should understand that the old one will come back when it's ready.- new classes for the winter map: snowboarder can travel quickly downhill, glider can travel far distances quickly, and rock climber can climb mountains and travel around rather easily through predetermined ziplines that go both uphill and downhill. i imagine summer map and map will have their own classes as well.- spawn points. rather than jumping out of a plane, you pick exactly which point on the map you wish to spawn at and are teleported there instantly at the start of the match. this also offers you an opportunity to know where everyone else spawns, and how worried to be about player activity in your spawn area. you can spawn away from everyone else for worry-free farming, or drop straight into a hot zone and rush the best loot.- rather than a barrier of some sort that closes in slowly in pretty much every other br, this time (at least on winter map) the permafrost replaces a barrier, and it shows up instantly when the timer goes to . the frost will progressively hurt more as the temperatures drop.- the winning condition. once the frost has almost envelopped the entire map, a rescue helicopter swoops in to rescue up to individual survivors, or an entire man squad. anyone who makes it to the chopper to get those four seats wins, and by this point there's usually - people left so it's quite a battle to climb on without someone shooting you. this does, however, allow for more than one winner in almost every case. some people will like this mechanic, some will not, but it's original and a good concept.- all the big cities have lore in almost every second house in the form of newspapers and journals, giving you a little insight into the map itself when you've got some free explore time. cons: what are those? besides some bug fixing, this game has none. graphics are nice, music is nice, gameplay is nice, it's all around a solid game that teabags every other br on the market. the only real con is that every other br game is going to have to adopt a fp model or go extinct thanks to this jewel appearing at the small price of $ for everyone.other thoughts: the ice pick class is just straight up op, you have absolutely no reason to pick the other two classes when this class exists. not only do you have increased carry capacity, but your mobility is insane. you also don't need to be at the top of a hill to use this class, as ziplines go both ways and are all over the place. my suggestion to the devs would be to either make ziplines usable by all classes, or make ice picks given to everyone with the other two as extra choices. alternatively, for balance you can add more ski-lifts and only allow snowboarder class to use them. i can't think of a way to balance glider, as it's only really good for making one trip down a mountain to escape the frost and then it's useless for the rest of the game. jumping off a story building will get you feet, you absolutely have to be at the top of a mountain to get any use out of it which also limits your potential strategic spawn locations.",1

15086,"great game! lots of fun to be had playing this, build your own little ship, whether it drives, flies, hovers or simply crashes and dies, it's a huge amount of fun! a must try for those that like world of tanks or similar. of course being in alpha means that it isn't clear of bugs and is not great on the server side at times, mainly when updates occur, but once it's working, and you get a good team together, it is brilliant! i'll continue to avoid doing more social things to play this instead.there is in-game purchases but you can't buy things, to my knowledge, which give you an advantage over free-to-play gamers. they're either to jump ahead in terms of tiers (so you can literally just start the game and buy a tier robot), or they're to buy things like holoflags to place on your robots and show off. the system which you have to go through to progress through the game is cleverly done and keeps players at a reasonable pace when playing for free. i'm currently on tier but i have stuck in this tier as this is where i find myself most comfortable with playing. you can quite easily jump back and fourth between tiers so if a friend joins a week or two later you can go back and build one to play with them.unfortunately platoons (how you play with friends) is limited to players, unless you buy premium then you get . which seems small but works well to keep teams balanced in matches.overall it is a fantastic start to a game which i believe will continue to grow as a community and continue to advance as it grows.",1

11328,"gave it five hours. i grinded hours to try and get enough stuff to actually build a deck. you know, a deck with those super powerful cards thatstomp you when you're new. the ones where you just read it and go, yeah okay gg i guess...i did not gain enough money to buy more than packs, while i went out of my way to complete every possible quest given to me to make sure i maximized gold and spirit or whatever. i got jackto be honest. i took apart every card from every class except commons worth one and the cards i wanted to use in my colors.i still had enough to buy just one exotic thing. that's a / draw to get that card. you need the four.this game is pay to win is the tldr. spend money on packs to getis the only way you will be able to advance in this game. which is really a shame since i really liked the way the game played but getting mypushed in by those super powerful cards i cant afford is just not ing fun. i don't want to grind more to just get one more copy then keep going and goin and going. lastly, as i touched on above, is to big for a deck. works in most other card games, and some even go as low as , which is great. that consistency is amazing.don't bother with this game if you don't want to spend real money. i sware the reviews i see that say it's great because you get a pack a day or something are braindead. one pack a day is nothing when all but one card are good in it, and even then the good card is going to be scrapped for almost nothing",0

12117,"very first review.and i'm doing it because i'moff. not at bless particularly. but at the community as a whole. do people forget launches such as swtor? or the burning crusade? matrix online anyone? there have been countless worse mmo launches. and quite honestly people are lazy. the mmo community has become such spoiled brats (we used to slog through uo and everquest for god sakes). was the launch a mess? absolutely. are people too lazy to fix things a bit. literally copy and paste and change word to fix all framerate issues. .ini files and an open gl fix. literally min and people can't do it. its easier than installing from a dvd for christ sakes. the mmo community as a whole has become lazy, spoiled. (looking at you peon). like your stuff but you did this game an injustice. mmo gamers used to be the best ones. ones willing to put in time, not afraid of a challenge, and generally the most tech minded. but that has changed. i like bless. for all its flaws. the launch has felt like your apart of something big imo. weather that is good or bad its felt big. i'd like the mmo community, especially us old timers to try to remember all the launches we've been through, and even though frustrating some times they are always fun. and i'd like the people who make completely uninformed posts and reviews like telling people there is no end game so don't bother. (its coming in weeks like really). i'd like those people to stick to fortnite honestly and stop ruiningfor the rest of us making devs not even want to produce an mmo. would you want to deal with this community? i'm disappointed. good or bad bless is fun imo as are most hyped mmos just to be a part of the hype and the launch is worth the $ for me. everyone is entitled to there own opinion, but at least make sure they are not misleading. i feel sorry for the devs honestly. it was there first time self publishing and the community and a lot thanks to peon has branded this game unfairly and given no time to fix things. they are listening. doing what we ask. things have changed. and its disappointing to see how it has. both with the community, and publishers and all this cashshop t across the whole medium we love. but i'd like to remind the mmo vets and people who play this game as a whole. its been out exactly a week. and people expect magic. get over it. thats literally every mmo ever. disappointing.",1

4238,"out of of this game, and let me tell you, this yu-gi-oh! mobile/pc version is one of the best childhood card game competition that ever played! no kidding, you'll have a lot of time playing this pocket-sized link vrains speed duel wannabe that you can get. even though, the mobile version, you'll get a lot of time collecting cards and dueling your foes, but if it's not enough, then the pc version will blow you away. as they say: it's time to duel!!the downside of this game is that, even if you want to transfer your mobile game data to the pc version, you'll be ending up erasing your game for good. do not dare to erase duel links from your phone without transfering your game data to this version!! if your game and deck is actually important to you then follow the transfer data steps carefully and don't erase the game without transfering your best deck. well as for duel links, you'll get your lovable characters from your childhood from the show and the manga. (seriously the manga is great, until kids messed the anime so badly over a decade) all the characters are really there, which includes yugi (atem), kaiba, jounouchi (joey), mai, anzu (tea), and yugi muto, and even other minor characters that came to duel links and with all of their ace cards.. but that's not all, konami brought it over the gx series with jaden and company to keep the duel links running. and this game will make your life more easier than wasting your money on trading cards. however, as my perspective, i know yu-gi-oh! very well, but that doesn't mean that i go crazy and collect more trading cards, i much rather play the game than spending my money on cards. however, even if you compete online on a rank duel, you'll get the fact that this game is far more competitive than the rest of the past yu-gi-oh! games, even ygopro didn't cut it. so if i much rather play the mobile version more often, i would make this one my second duelist account of this version. the playthrough is great, but the other downside is that even if the game keeps going on the updates, i don't know if this game is already on its limits, because the dueling arena is just more like the speed duels on vrains. but what if they added the ds era or the zexal era, what will happen then?? if you're about to synchro summon, then how many of the tunner monsters and the actual monsters are going to fit on the field until you'll know when to do it. and when you xyz summon, that's no problem, because you can only play only two xyz monsters on the field, that's it. well this isn't the everyday traditional yu-gi-oh! dueling rules because somehow the rules have kept changing over the years. my best bet is that even if you want to try this game, you'll might have to start learning the rules of this dueling system.so keep dueling! collect more cards, unlock new characters and gain more rare cards. and you'll be the strongest duelist ever around, so good luck.",1

2832,"this is the worst good game i've ever played.the level fo detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible. the fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof, the fact that you can use machineguns as airbrakes, the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are desctructible, and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour.the fact is, however, that literally everything about the game that isn't the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable.* everything above br -ish takes millions of years to unlock. even when playing with a premium account, you're looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semi-modern tank. if you don't have parts and you get tracked, you won't be able to move for the rest of the game.* whether you get to respawn or not is decided by how many spawn points you've earned. you earn spawn points for killing the enemy. so whatever side wins the initial engagement, always wins the rest of the game.* if you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo, you need to land on an air field and repair and refit. i can count on one hand the amount of times i've had time to get back to the map after rtbing, because the matches are incredibly short.* if your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to respawn, you can't choose to not respawn because you'll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points.* why don't you just spawn and die, then? because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money. at mid-br, repairs get insanely expensive. it is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills, capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money.* there hasn't been any changes to the above for the + years i've been playing.",0

16604,"product received for freegood take on the bloons franchise... except for the tons of poor ui limitations.- no replay function (you can't see what you did wrong or what your opponent did right).- lack of keybinds for sending balloons (the available keybinds are not even shown in-game)- poor use of screen real estate (probably because there's some mobile version)- tower descriptions often give insufficient info (price, attack speed, range, damage... all mostly missing)- bloon descriptions are pretty much completely missing in game- tower placement is still dependent on skillful mouse-pixelling; no snap-to-edge function- some towers require unnecessary micro: farms, gatling, etc- tower abilities don't allow targeting (and also have no keybinds)- incoming waves are neither described nor indicatedsome gameplay elements are also not up to par for a multiplayer game:- no elo matching (it's pretty much a random matchup)- weirdly structured leaderboards (no way for newcomers to catch up without weeks of grind)- medal pricing is quite prohibitive for newcomers (be prepared to grind the first few days unless you git gud fast)- towers aren't very balanced (apprentice/ninja/buccaneer > almost every other tower)all in all, if you enjoyed the bloon td games, this is a pretty fun take allowing you to match against other players. at the very least, the game isn't pw. well, you could pay to unlock towers more quickly, and that could help you win; but it only takes at most up until your first weekly reward to unlock most towers.nonetheless, until they upgrade the ui substantially, this game will annoy the heck out of you and force you to read copious amounts of guides just to find out what towers do, which bloons to send when, and why certain waves + assault are so powerful. if you just want a casual versus game, might wanna look elsewhere.",0
7364,"while the presentation of this game is phenomenal and the variety of cards is already strong, this game is extremely stingy with actually giving out cards. with high prices, slow level gain, and wide variance, i just don't think this can stand up when compared to other fp card games on steam.",0

let's see who could probably know the answer for this question. today we will journey through all pros and cons of this game, and we will hopefully talk about all that is not â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in this game. the game itself has a loong story, now, let me tell you, take a good snack, sit down in your chair comfortably, and enjoy. long long time ago, even before the (in)famous day z fell onto this lands, there was an invention. an idea so brilliand and innovative, that noone has ever done that before, in the history of do... ekhm, noone has ever done. some developer, saw the succes of a mod. a mod so brilliant, that it became a standalone game shortly after. the mod name was arma: day z mod. it brought players up to a new level of games. to a new level of genre. it was first zombie survival game. so the developer tought: why not making my own game? and he began a process of creation, soon there showed trees, giant, sky reaching pines. the mountains, massive and glorious, the river with water so clear, that every player wanted to see that clearview. the cities, with building reaching to the stars,. the map itself, being huge part of the world filled with death, and nothing more. the map soon was habitated by zombies. strong, fearsome zombies, capable of taking with them even the strongest warriors of our time. the game was good, you could constantly feel the thrill, what was giving you infinite boost of adrenaline. will i die today? what monstrous creature, what filthy villain will take me down today? will i survive? will i deliver my loot back to safeplace or will i die? but soon, dark times came, and dark forces of bug came to devour the code of the game. almost immortal zombies, teleporting and stacking in each other. crashing. lack of sandwitches. hackers, capable of doing things a normal human can't do. the one's that broke the matrix. sadly, after a short time, developer started to have some problems with fixing all of theese. the hacers fighting the system, constantly created new ways to get past the anti-cheat. the bugs were defending themselves, and, most importantly, the players got bored. the game started to die, rotting alive, it was about to exhale with its last breath. the game itself, started from being war z. but after the success of day z standalone, the movie world war z (lots of z's in this part) came, and took the title of the only warz. the game had to defend itself, so it made a plan. it changed its name. now, as an infestation: survivor stories, it had a chance, of... survival. the name change lured some players, that were thinking of changes it might take. but, not a single stanag c-mag was found that day. the loot was stillâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the snipers were still blazing with blazers, wating for another prey to come by their favourite spot. it was all for nothing, only the strongest stayed amongst the players who actually played the game. soon, the developer dropped the project, it drowned him down, taking amounts of money, and giving none. the game died. until, one day, a big company tought about bringing the idea back to life. they did all that was needed to be done, for this game to come back to life: they bought it, changed drop rate from you will find cannedâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥x and die in hrs of looting to you will need military ruck to take all thoose goodies that are in this wooden hut. to loot military place, you need a crew, then they made the game free to play, and put down some new, own servers. of course big changes, came with the name change, for the third time, and hopefully the last, the game changed its name to infestation: the new z. and this is how this game became playable once again. teh end :vnow for real:-didn't remember this game to look so good, but i could just play on graphic: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥&lots of off's back then, so verry likely nothing changed-zombies actually work, and they areâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥now, so ye... yay!-campers? blasers? yep, they are still here. but! now you can loot tons of weapons n' stuff from basically everywhere, rly you go to grocery store and you just pick up weapons, ammo armors etc. rly easy to find sniper rifle too, just need to know the right spots.-you can log out to put your statsh in gi everywhere, no need of going to the settlement.so in summary:-by making this game easier with multi times better loot, and weak zombies, they actually made this game playabe, and really fun to play and pvp on. totally recommend (espetially that they made this game free to play too)-in old war z gc/premium was making you strooonk. it was rly pay to win, mostly because the lack of anything spawning anywhere. now premium just gives u some minor advantages.-err, beware of super zombies, they take like your whole ammo + you must find more ammo to defeat this+ rly dude, take more ammo! aaand they also dropâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i mean, in old warz i'd probably cry if i saw that loot, but now... you can find times that in wooden shack in the middle of the woods...",1
17407,"its okay, but not great, thats just it. it has so much potential as a free to play game, but you cant play free unless you are in a clan. tradeing is limited, and thus so is your ability to play free. you can not buy krono if youre a free player, and you can not sell things on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono. if you can see past limitations and want a good game to explore, this game is for you.the crafting system is a nice feature, though the sounds may put you to sleep as it is very relaxing.overall, the game is more of a / for what it has to offer, but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitations if you just want to play free.update: i dont know what the hell happened but the game is now riddled with bugs. you are officially better off playing runescape!",0

2337,"been playing this game since , little less than years now, took a break during breach and prophecy league as i was playing other games. i never once doubted that ggg would keep developing a great game and trying it back during closed beta, i knew that they would bring us an arpg bringing us the d and d vibes that d failed to bring. now sitting in i was glad i stuck with this game and supported them through buying supporter packs and mtx from the cash shop. for new players i believe that the games learning curve has gotten easier with the ammount of guides from the community and ggg's own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character. although the curve to get into the game has gotten easier the challenge of earning currency, building a great character, and the endgame hasn't gotten any easier infact even harder. true poe has builds that make the game's content look like a joke and there will always be a meta, but the fun the game brings through running maps at endgame or simply leveling through acts - hasn't changed. i haven't always played on steam as there was client issues in multiple leagues so my hours haven't all been on record but i will say i have atleast k+ total hours and counting in this game and plan on many more.if people are doubting whether the game is truly free to play look at other reviews, go into the game yourself or even just watch videos. the game is truly free, it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop is strictly cosmetic and convenience. what i do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game is catch the sales they have weekly and always buy on sale, they run multiple stash tab sales and you should only really buy when they are on sale unless you are st starting out. i highly recommend buying currency tab, quad tab, map tab, and premium tab. essence, divination, and fragment tabs are pure convenience and really are only for those who truly want a tab for all the small things. if you cant spend $ on a game you can enjoy for hours at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you shouldn't be playing a fp game at all.to close this wall of text, i recommend any new player who enjoys arpg, and the d and d to try this game, if you are simply wanting to cure your itch for lost ark or whatever other new arpg coming out in the future poe is a great way to do so. if you just simple enjoy arpg and want a fair cash shop, crazy build customization, and hours of fun then download and start playing.",1

4623,"this game has its pros and its cons. having + hours invested in this game, i can make a little analysis.most of this analysis will be based on the game mode conquest because that is the ompetitive, premier game mode. first of all, no you cannot transition from league of legends to this game. the two games have separate metas to each game. while it is also a moba, it is not a game that you can pick up. that being said, this is not an easy game. you will have to have a grasp of over gods and their kits, and learn there pros and cons and matchups against other characters. secondly, it will take a while to face people that know what they're doing. before they introduced the new leveling system, the maximum level was level . if you were not level , people would call out things like it was league of legends instead of understanding the choices in lanes were relative and you must pick solo lane or duo lane instead of left or right. people will blame you for not being there for them when they were too aggressive and you wanted to cut the losses and steal something from them. people just don't fully grasp the game and what they're doing wrong. it will be frustrating for a little while due to the leveling issues.then you hit a certain level where the entire game changes. it used to be about games into level , but now it's different.but once you hit a certain level, the game will choose to test your skills against higher skilled people. people will gank you and be aggressive. they will be smart and group up to steal objectives and gank you. at that point, you will have to commumicate will your teammates and defend what is yours or counter steal another objective or tower. and, for the most part, no matter behind you are in levels and gold, you are never completely out of the fight. as the game goes on respawn timers get longer and you are able to catch up by taking objectives and towers that cold completely turn the game around, and all it takes is a misplay. the long games are some of the most rewarding experiences or biggest heartbreaks in almost any game i've played.the conquest game mode has been up and down since the middle of season and through season . i personally barely played season , just played enough ranked to get into diamond again. with how the map has been revamped, it feels the most engaging and exciting season i've played.the neat thing about this game is that you can get all the gods and future gods for $, and sometimes -$ on sales. the game is very accessible taht way. however, they get there money from loot chests that you have to spend on gems, which you either get from logging on every day, getting up to per week or buying them. all of the good skins are in a pool oftier trash to pretty cool skins. the chests have a set limit on what is in them, ususally ranging at - skins or boosters and misc. they claim that the skins are all randomized and not in a set order, but all the good skins end up to come up when youre at the very end of the list. i encourage people to get coolskins because they do put a lot of effort into them and that's where their creativity comes out. but just keep that in mind when you are planning to buy a chest to get skins.",1

3818,"gaben has singlehandedly sucked my social life and my bank savings out of me with this one free to play game. well played, valve. but, still, there are plenty of good things to say about this game. it's certainly one of the few with the more pleasant communities that i've run into, and for every script kiddie or unpleasant player, there are plenty more humourous and amusing ones just here to have some lighthearted fun. with an audience that seems to be made of older teens up to early twenties, with some younger kids sprinkled in, the community still manages to be friendly and open. mostly, anyway. you'll meet an aimbot or a more hostile player in a few here and there, but what community doesn't have those. tf is considerably nicer than some gaming communities i've been around.the competitive scene is lacking, and while the tf team is making an effort to put some emphasis on comp, pubs remain the larger attraction for many new and old players alike, leaving tf players who are interested in playing competitively, unfortunately, high and dry. these players have to go to third-party sources for opportunities to play in competitive modes such as s and highlander. valve desperately needs to provide a competitive mode similar to these two forms of competitive tf, or perhaps a non-competitive option that allows players to practise s / highlander. their comp mode is much improved now compared to what it was a few months ago, but it certainly is still lacking.though there are only nine playable classes, there is always something new to touch upon or some skill to learn and master. tf provides an abundance of weapons that are obtainable through crafting, trading, drops, or purchases. the large range of weapons definitely give classes more options, more opportunity to vary playstyle, and endless creativity when it comes to how they take on a game or counter an enemy team.some classes can definitely be fixed/improved upon, such as the pyro (many of whom seem to know only one playstyle: the w+m 'meta'), and there can definitely be changes made. however, i understand the delay in doing so, as balancing/changing a single class can have profound impact on the rest of the classes and the game.overall, a very fine product that remains fun to play and always leaves room for learning despite only having nine classes, and one that has a relatively welcoming and fun community. it's not a surprise to see that tf is a game that's thriving after more than years. i have made a great amount of (online) friends in this game, both by interacting with the communities within dedicated to tf youtubers as well as in-game. glad to see a product so community-focused (even if at times i wish it were a little less so). fine job on this one, gaben, and godspeed to the tf team.( also note: there are hats. lots of hats. you'll never see as many hats in your life as you'll see in this game. )",1

178,"after seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,i wanted to make a review talking about what a great horror game this is.first of all,it's free.i really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.karamari hospital (the dlc) costs just under $,but if you enjoyed the game i would recommend the dlc.now,i'm gonna get into the main review.the game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.the game doesn't feel like it stole these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references..if you find jump scares scary.get this game..if you are unsure,try watching markiplier or someone play it,that's how i found out about it.just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises..i found i rarely died from enemies,but that was because i was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.time to talk about the enemies!!(i won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(possible spoilers)specimen .the main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,i began to fear them more then the actual enemies.they jump scare you,but the do it all the time,and it's terrifying.specimen and chase you around,they aren't the scariest.i skipped a bit of the game,(i'm gonna replay it all soon),so i missed the specimen and parts.they still look spooky though.specimen is well...the bane of my existence.specimen is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.his death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of zelda references,which i quite enjoyed.just,when you play the game,be ready for specimen .specimen isn't really scary.but it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters much harder.specimen is the deer god.things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then shows up,and the terror begins.although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.specimen randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.i have never encountered him before,[spoileri] he re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.it is fun,and similar to the ganon battle from loz:ooc.[/spoileri] specimen is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.i don't entirely remember him,but i remember he is very hard to run away from.specimen ,who i refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.i remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe i was just nervous when i entered his area.the area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.there is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.specimen the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.it takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.it was very fun,and scary.specimen who i call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to kaernk from 'amnesia:the dark descent'.you must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.it was really fun,and the area before was very scary.that raps up the review of the monsters,but i have a few more things to say..the game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror..the game has a lot of references,which is one of the best parts of the game..this game is terrifying.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :)i would definitely recommend this game./",1

9862,"(this review will be edited over the course of elsword updates)this game is so awesome:pros:- different characters to choose from, with different job paths for each one, giving them a variety of different skills and playstyles- the leveling up for starters is uper fast, and once you get past level -, the leveling gets more challenging- there's an elsword website which keeps you updated on every single tiny thing added or announced, so that's awesome- a pvp (player vs player) mode which pairs you up with a random player to battle- a dungeon mode you can play with friends or randomly matched people to complete in-game story quests- the characters' voices were originally in korean, but now kog is slowly revamping each character with some fresh new english voice lines, and they sound awesome!cons:- the pvp system is kind of unfair, you always get paired up with some elsword veteran who ends up demolishing you with an endless combo, but i don't really see any way to fix that- this game is kind of pw, having you spend money on the in-game currency, k-ching, to get the good costumes and stuffaside from that, the game is great! i totally recommend this! /banthus approved.",1
8285,"just started this game today and to be honest i wasn't really impressed. so far it's not really a bad game per say, it's just it seems so... dull for me. the action combat isn't all that actiony. not like other games such as dragon nest or tera.for me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. neverwinter simply did not thrill me. i dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. what is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? combat seems very clunky. i stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, it's just not for me.on top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily paywin as levels progress. while i may not have witnessed this first hand, i have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. boss mechanics consist of mostly cone / aoe then spawn adds. repeat process as difficulty increases. really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. check youtube videos, it's obvious.don't get me wrong, while i may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put me off from the game. there are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. while it's obviously harder for them, if you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. it's just annoying how much of an advantage paying does give you. overall i think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an equal fp experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else.",0
8530,"this is a great new game by hirez studios.reviews on this game at the moment are mixed due to a patch many didn't like. the devs in this game are very good at listening to the community and making changes that are beneficial. although i also feel as though they may listen too much and knee jerk a reaction too quickly.game is free, why wouldn't you at least give it a try. it's a lot of fun, and the class based system is suprisingly extremely balanced for being a class based game. sure some classes may be stronger than other but overall the fight will favor the player with more skill.would highly recommend you play this game and give it a try.",1

2078,"path of exile is the most faithful successor to diablo that you'll find, including diablo . while d took the approach of world of warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, path of exile leans in the opposite direction. it's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. truly, if feels as if everything that diablo did wrong, path of exile does right.the one area that poe really diverges from the classic diablo formula is in the active skill system. active skills are granted by gem items. skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with support gems in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.and that's what's really great about this game. the enormous scope of build variety and character customization. poe's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. want to build a huge, muscle-bound marauder that casts spells and holds wands? want to create a witch or ranger that uses a cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? go for it. if you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.it's the most technical hack-and-slash arpg out there, and likely the most unforgiving. the path to is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. it might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. the challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.and, somehow, the game is entirely free. there is -zero- pay to win here. you can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. there is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.as a huge fan of the genre, poe really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now.",1

13070,"*note: my playtime on steam does not reflect the many hours i played on my phone.so i saw a lot of negative reviews on the game and i do understand where they're coming from. but, to be fair this is originally a mobile game and most of the problems that are pointend out come from the fact that it is a mobile game...to get straight to the point do i recommend?hell yeah! if your a fallout fan and hungry for some extra fallout content definately go for it. its even free.and really by all means try it out cause its not a bad game at all. if you've played mobile games before you'll aprreciate that it is one of the gems in astorm that is the google play store...for a more detailed overview, here are the pros & conspros-its fallout-decent vault managing content.-nicley polished fallout style graphics.-lots of loot and equipment.-not a pay to win.cons -quest lines can become repetitive quick.-no strong story line or dialogues treading in grey areas.-difficulty drops pretty fast.-can take long to perform upgrades or crafting.now with all of the above being said...i'd like to point out that some of the cons are quite inevitable for a mobile game.-no strong story line or decision making dialougefor this i have to say i do agree that life or death deciding moral decisions will spice up the game a lot.but, you have to take into account that this is fp. people spend cash to get there rare equipment or dwellers.imagine thestorm the devs will have to go through confronting angry players who had there cash items disappear to an ingame event... (the main fallout games can give you difficulat decisions cause you have a savegame to fall back too. plus if you up you can always start a new game with out having to pay extra for anything...)-can take long to perform upgrades or crafting.its a mobile game... guys... people who play mobile games usually don't spend hours to play a game in one sitting. they usally play while on break, while they go home, during lunch, etc...the hours don't matter to much because they spend most of that waiting time to do what they do. plus the game isn't a public service. the devs need money to create new content. upgrade speed boosts are a good way for them to monetize the game.you can hate on microtransaction all you want but, this game has one of the more reasonable microtransaction schemes i've seen in years for a mobile game... plus for fallout shelter the paying is really just for time reduction. there is no pvp elements so your not missingout on anything even if you don't pay.-quest lines can become repetitive quick.-difficulty drops pretty fast.these two i actually have to admit are probably the biggest flaws of this game. even considering the fact the devs can't really throw you difficult decisions, the questlines available are very bland. just to be fair i think the devs decided to add the quest content as an afterthought because it dind't exist at launch.for the difficulty, it gets really easy pretty quick. the raiders/death claws/roaches become easy to repel soon enough and serve nothing much than a minor annoyance in the later game. occasionally fires might breakout in the vault but, that is also a minor issue. until the devs introduce some new threats and new buildings, after you build up your vault(+ dwellers) it will get repetitive.thats pretty much all i have to say about this game. it has a fair share of flaws but, if your a fallout fan its deffinately worth checking out. it might serve as a good filler in between your long journeys in the mohave and capital wasteland./ will send dwellers out again for population control.",1
13144,"fallout shelter.great, fun game, nice time waster. really enjoyable. never really played these type of games but shelter does good what it does.you are the overseer that controls everything in the vault.really fun training all your dwellers for special stats, equipping all that gear, sending them out into the wasteland or on quests which are fun to do, but can take a while if you don't have, or are low, on quantums. some quests reward them, so if you have no problem waiting, you'll get some more. some also reward lunchboxes! no need to buy them, but if you want more, fast loot, buy away.same with crafting, it takes time, can speed it up a little by equipping dwellers with certain gear for stats on whatever you are crafting, or can be completed straight away with quantums, it's good saving them up!getting more dwellers is best...the old fashioned way ;)the radio studio is pretty bad, in my case rarely have i gotten dwellers from the outside and also apperantely attracts deathclaws or enemies in general more often to attack, not sure.combat is a little too fast paced, at least in a big vault with a lot of dwellers, quests are fine. if they start losing health too fast, which happens pretty often, you got to heal them all fast one by one, and sometimes a few can die, with the clunky clicking around, especially when one attack happens soon after another and you haven't recovered. the common attacks (especially deathclaws) and accidents can get pretty annoying, but it's managable. best to expand slowly.i like the way cappy and bottle visit pretty often, playing tracks from nuka world and raising that happines, cool.also pets, pets are cute.seems like legendary dwellers are really rare, also none from fallout new vegas, which is a shame. it's no big deal really, but including some would be fun and great!mysterious stranger, the badass, appears pretty often, who gives caps, random amount, sometimes can be a pain to find on time, but still fun.maybe an elder scrolls game, like fallout shelter, would be fun? who knows!overall, very fun game, definitely recommend.",1

11817,"wow. where do i even start? neowiz has had more than ample time to address some of the concerns with this game that have been plaguing it for years... this was by far the absolute worst launch i have ever experienced and i own archeage, diablo and many others that go down in the history books for such. the combat is an absolute joke. this semi-linear, tab targeting combat system makes you feel like you have somewhat of a variety but in reality you'll just be spamming the same buttons constantly. when i say spamming, i mean you'll hit r times and then it will finally use your chain skill. there is an undeniable lag from the input to actual action that makes you feel like you're on dial-up. the ui is possibly one of the worst aspects of this entire game. there are literally games from the late s with better and more customizable uis (asheron's call, the realm online, etc...). completely ignoring the fact it takes approximately tries to get the game to actually launch, once you're in you're plagued with constant crashes, graphics lag and other terrible graphics issues such as the game freezing for a few seconds just from opening your quests journal, inventory or map. as if it wasn't terrible enough at this point, the game won't even support it's advertised aspect ratios/resolutions. if you choose the wrong settings on the launcher it will crash your game when you launch it. the pure amount of technical issues with this game, the absolutey poor response and acknowledgement of these issues on neowiz's behalf and the fact that there are apparently no plans to address any of these issues is why i cannot recommend this game and i am requesting a refund.literally / stars.",0
8677,"all around amazing, the game can be run on a potato pc, just like mine, and futhermore it has more features than any other battle royal, this game allows the player to chose a class and that fits their own personal style, the game does have its issues, however as this is an alpha product all i can say is: well done hi-rez. if you struggle to run fortnite and fancy changing things up then give realm royale a chance, if you like it then you like it, and as of now it isnt filled with microtransactions so there are no features that allow players to have a higher advantage just because they paid for it. lastly, the controls arent hard to use, they are simple easy and fine, the controller support is only partial, but that still doesnt mean you cant plug in your controller and give it a go. you'd be surprised at this game if you gave it a chance.",1

11581,"# tl;dr -> down belowafter hours of gametime i thought i'll give my opinion on this game. i saw a few other reviews about how the game is garbage because it has loot boxes and has a lot of hackers. let me just say this.: you get lootboxes for free, you get keys for free every month. if there's an event going on, you basically get a key everyday. i can't mention any other game that works like this and it's even free. about the hackers... this game is easy to learn but hard to master, which brings this game to the point where you can be matched with skilled players even though you just started hours ago and don't even know how to run faster. talking about the quick matches, the game does have a decent matchmaking system though. not every match is balanced, but i don't know any game that has a perfect balance system. competitive matches are weird, coming from cs:go i was pretty surprised that a lot of people get eagle as their first rank... ofc depending on how you play, but it is the most common rank i would say. this rank has a lot of newbie players thus making it harder to rank up ( look at it like cs:go silver ranks ). overall the gameplay is fluid. the game does have a few weird things like the reloading is weird at first ( you can shoot at bullet, since the last bullet is already in the chamber and not in the mag ) i can't really say any negative about anything in this game. it's free, you can get easy skins which you can sell on the steam market. try it. play it. you won't regret it.tl;dr.# pros:- cs:go's and cod's secret son - fluent gameplay- customizable ui ( crosshair, : stretched, fov, weapon fov )- skins ( with steam market support )- free keys to open boxes- events ( halloween, christmas, ... etc )- daily missions- never met a hacker.- devs are on point.:- weird ranking in competitive. ( not a big problem )- reloading ... when the mag is already inside the weapon it doesn't mean it is reloaded ( ofc when you don't have tothe gun ) it is a bit delayed. you gotta get used to it.i switched from cs:go ( ~ hours ) to this. and i'm happy i did.thank you ns studio, very cool!edit: now the game has voice chat, my life is complete.",1

(sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like dota )- several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags.- very poor class balance- extremely poor pvp balance (for example, you can move your best in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min. lvl required) - i think i dont have to explain how much impact it have. even at max lvl pvp there's insane gear gap between players.- refiling system - pretty much pay to win feature. it makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lot's of real $ to get nearly bis or bis gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops.- this game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players. if this doesnt change in near future it will be the reason why this game dies.",0

3809,"i made my steam account specifically for tf back in the day, and there was a long time i'd just play this game for hours every day of the week. i loved tf to death, i can still remember how happy i was when i first found a hat or when i uncrated something good. the best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. it seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. it was great.those days are completely gone though. this year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. i feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. the last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. the war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. what about the new content for pyro? pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. team fortress just feels dead. in the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much i hadn't even tried yet. now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.i have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone i know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. i know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. i know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. step up your game.",0

2808,"i have played this game for five years, and i must say to never ever download this game. ever since more premium vehicles have been added gaijin seems to only care about money. not only is the community of this game actually garbage, but they seem to only focus on certain tech trees and pertain to buffing them at all costs. recently in update . gaijin seemed to have added more prmium vehicles and interesting armor features. the intelligent members of the community saw this as a money grab and a distraction for the lemmings in the community. rather than fix in game issues gaijin added a shiny new vehicle and some cool features deriving from the much needed balencing issues and the other numerous issues this game is plagued with. basically putting a nice finish on a pile of four years ago i chose the soviet union for ground realistic battles. i had been grinding on the tech tree up until today // when i discovered something horrid. the object had been moved to .. incase who ever is reading this does not know, the object is a modification to the pt- made by the soviet union in in order to modernize it. in game it has an armor piercing capped balistic capped shell that has decent if not good performance and a good high explosive anti tank shell. the only issue is the battle rating. at the battle rating of . the goes against vehicles such as the leopard , the leopard aa (with apds), the cheiftan mk, the stb , and the american tanks which are of no issue. with all of these excellente vehicles combined it equals a bad time for the which can barely pen all of these vehicles and has a k repair cost in in game currency and a heaty heat shell expense. the icing on all of this is the fact that the battle rating before (.) was perfect for the tank. not only was it the only playable tank at that battle rating but it fought tanks that were in the same class at the same time. the only issue was the fact that a down tier would cause a massive problem as it out classed everything at .. . was if not the perfect battle rating had the leopard not had the ability to instantly kill the with heat because of hull break (yet another issue this game has). i have spent four years of my life for a tank that is completly useless. avoid this game if you value your time and money.",0

8592,"so...i started playing this game about a week ago. absolutely loved it. it's important to note that i usually hate battle royale games. but not this game.this game took (emphasis on past tense), all the things i hated about the battle royale genre, and threw them out the window.it was colorfull, without being minecraft. it wasn't a camping simulator. and the rgn in this game was limited.you were encouraged, no, required to fight, if you wanted to have a good chance at winning. the best weapons and equipment didn't randomly drop somewhere, you had to craft them at a forge. crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player. this, and the fact that you got a reward (shards, which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general) whenver you killed another player, made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights. because fights were encouraged, and they were worth taking the risk.people couldn't just drop somewhere far off, loot everything and then camp.that is, until a few days ago. ignoring every bit of community feedback, the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out, and unique, and good, and threw it out the window.it's the same rng infested, camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now, that every other battle royale game already is too.you can find dozens of similar games now, with the only difference between them and this game being, that they are less colorfull, and their developers probably don't ignore the feedback from their community (unlike this game)",0

2767,"to start, i should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. when the community is good, it's great! i've formed many lasting friendships, and i'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone i met through the game.but war thunder has a problem with women. not all players are like that--not even the majority. but enough s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls i know, and we as a community can do better.i'm a woman. i like to play comp, and i get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. for the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy j somehow gets me every push.) but there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. and sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if i'll send nudes, or if i'll perform an obscene act for you. (even if you're joking, it's really not funny, i promise.) it's grating to be continually asked if i'm a bomber main since i'm a girl, or for you to demand that i pocket you. (i don't play bomber. sorry. how about naval planes?)it's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them trolling me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and aand much, much worse. i've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. when playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.and despite all this, i still get on mic and speak. partly because i'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. time and time again, i've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. they say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. people say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.i know most of you are decent people. i'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. but we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. more than just reporting it when you see it (although i wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. even a simple hey man, that's not cool can both () let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and () let the harassee know that decent people do exist. the silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.so please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!eta: thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, i appreciate it! it means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. like i said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.a couple people have said things akin to this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc. i'm well aware of how the internet can be, and i do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result. it's not me i'm worried about; a lot of people don't have such a thicc skin, and it's those girls who aren't as hardened as i am who really suffer. just because i'm a hardened shrew doesn't mean we all have to be.people have also said things akin to if you don't want to be subject to homophobic harassment when you're playing with your girlfriend, you shouldn't announce to people that you guys are dating. aside from putting the blame on me (which i think is unfair), i don't think these people understand the dynamics at play. it's not like i announce to everyone hey guys, this is my girlfriend! we are dating! (although i really ought to, because she's a phenomenal woman). what generally happens is one of us will refer to other as babe during a game (e.g., nice pilot knockout, babe), then someone asks if we're dating, and then all hell breaks loose.also, every person who responded to this post with shut up bomber just proved my point. i know you think you're hilarious but you're not gonna get a comedy special for your scathing wit.",0

5741,"a true flight sim for any pilot enthusiest, especially if you are considering a military career. this isn't a game that u just jump into and expect to start flying. you need a basic understanding of flight instruments. if u get an add-on with a clickable cockpit, you will have to spend hours going through the training courses just to know how to start and operate the aircraft systems. you really cannot claim to master any aircraft without putting at least the standard of flight hours into each aircraft. the sense of accomplishment as u struggle with one apect, then turn it into an easy task, is what keeps me playing. when u get that perfect -point touchdown with the p-, then start doing it over and over, u really feel like its a major acheivement. at this point, i only have hours on the game, and i still feel like a noob. im very confident with the p- now and ill be going into the a- add-on next. as to physics, i cannot say whether they are absolutely realistic or not, but i am highly impressed. if u put the time into the game and really try to learn how to fly, thats when u get the entertainment factor out of it. it greatly helps to buy a dlc with clickable cockpit also and i will tell any pilot enthusiest to get this game.",1

6942,"this game is extremly close to hearthstone but somewhat worse, synergies are more important than stats according to them but they give aggro an edge over other control decks to the point, that in ladder, every aggro deck is the exact same deck with red as a base, and every control deck is exactly the same with green/purple. you will face the same two overpowered decks over and over and you will get sick of them because the game match you with people of the same level/rank as you... and when you hit level they will have the complete netdeck and you will face almost no variance. the good thing is that starter packs you buy with real money offer a lot of value but right now there are better more generous games like gwent that offer a different experience than hearthstone and might i say it, where you won't need to spend money if you don't want to.the developers tend to listen to the community to an overextent where if the comunity asks for nerfs, they will nerf the cards even if they consider them to be balanced. this is really good/bad because yeah, they will change the cards, but they won't test any changes making changes either a nerf to oblivion or stupidly unimportant.if you like hearthstone and want to try another extremly similar game, you will love this game. if you also like aggro vs aggro matches, this is probably the game for you. if you like getting ahead fast and hitting top players fast, this game is for you as not that many people are playing and it's somewhat easy to rank up using only a couple of decks and if you like small variance in decks, and a meta with little variance this is the game for you.if you like deckbuilding, i would not recommend this game. if you like control games, i would not recommend this game, and if you like generous card games i would go to either gwent or shadowverse, both of them excel where this game is left behind.",0

10587,"i put more hours into this than i expected, really. i was originally looking for something to scratch my mtg itch while waiting to see if i got a beta key for arena, but, after playing this, i really couldn't care less to get one. my only real gripe with the game is that some of the art is rather... displeasing to my tastes, while also addressing that this is an early access card game. there's going to be balancing issues. there's going to be shifts. that's expected; however, what is here is a joy to play. got it both on pc and tablet and i can say that it has become one of my favorite digital card games in almost no time. as for the redshell debacle, i think i came into this after that, so i cannot say anything on the matter.i will update this review as time goes by, but, so far, i recommend it. (though i am just a filthy casual: gauntlet, forge, casual, and draft for life).edit : after three weeks, i managed to unlock the first campaign, jekk's bounty, with only gold you earn in-game. ,. if i had to estimate the amount of time i truly played, between pc and tablet, i would say about hours. that's about... gold an hour... i did not expect that number, but... yeah! the other campaigns currently out are , apiece, so it's roughly -to- hours to unlock campaigns --or $, if you prefer to pay. in all truth, that's still good value. i have about % of the original card stock unlocked through simply chests, and about % of the special packs each, with the exception being fall of argenport at %.edit : i finally received a closed beta code for mtga... i knew i made the right call. this game feels far better to play. let's break down my first, oh, thirty games out of mtga's tutorial. first game, used the green deck, i swore my opponent was a bot with how bad they played. second game, same issue... third game, whiplash. i was obviously not on the same level with the guy, and i got creamed. fourth-tenth game, lost due to manaflood. card draws in a row, all lands. twelth game, guy quit after calling seven mulligans, having nothing in his hand. thirteenth-through-seventeenth, actually good games. fair. balanced. i lost fifteen and sixteen, but they were fun. eigtheen-through-twenty-five were jobs. opposite problem this time; i only had two lands the entire time. twenty-six through twenty-eight swapped to the black deck, got nothing but high-priced cards, and twenty-nine and thirty i played blue and once more faced people way out of my skill level.let's break all that down, shall we? ) matchmaking is hilariously bad. sure, it's quick. none of them went above seconds, but they were laughably one-sided for most of them. ) deck randomization/shuffling is not working as intended, unless it is to inspire hatred. ) it was boring. the ui layout is pretty, but when you have to look at it for easily fifteen minutes a match, waiting as someone agonizingly waits out timers to play the most simple of spells, it grows old fast.overall, i much prefer eternal over mtga. just... eternal may have its issues, but, after dealing with that, i am coming back with a smile on my face. i mean, i never left, but... i don't know where i was going with that. and to clarify: i don't hate mtga. it's fine for what it is, and it has the capacity to get better.edit : twitch prime! lots of goodies... this is going to be a critiquing post.one, i have to agree, standard decks are a touch too big. i believe is just a tad too large. on top of that, it demanding exactly / of it being land is a touch annoying. note that i am not saying you should run below it, but there are some strategies where having, say, two or four less lands does work into its favor. also note you can have more than a / lands, as well.two, time-justice combo is overpowered. period. just like green in mtg, it runs rampant. the fact certain combos haven't been nerfed while tribal's levitate was speaks volumes...three, the mobile app has become a nightmare to play... there's not much else i can say about that. it feels like it takes forever updating or something in the code has been changed enough for it to run like crap on my tablet and phone. computer one still runs perfectly fine.really, these are minor gripes. i'm closing on the -hour mark on pc, and, got to say, still want to keep playing. that's an achievement in of itself.edit : dwd making me working overtime. :) they did nerf the combo.edit : to sum up all the negative reviews in one, tidy package-rng is bad so it is bad. translation: i don't know how to build a deck or rework it so i can do better and instantly blame everyone but myself.tutorial too long. they already said they are working on it.mana system is bad and wouldn't be because [insert popular game here]! the irony in these people is palpable, esp. those saying the creator would have done something different. probably, but hindsight is /. get. over. it.hearthstone rip-off. in terms of... oh. right. they just say it. if its for the ui... wow. a good ui that others try to replicate while adding their own take on it? say it ain't so... artstyle? different enough. gameplay? more like magic-lite.certain cards are op and imbalanced. welcome to card games. also, those that usually say this also add the first two, which, again, the irony because they blame everything but themselves for failing.this should wrap up what most people say to get approved. if you are these kinds of people, i feel so sorry for you... oh, and red shell, but, as the initial review has stated, cannot speak on that.edit : since this has become a thoughtpiece on my opinion of mtg arena as well as eternal, i guess i'll post what i think of it after it came to open b-don't. even. bother.they learned nothing in the transition. matchmaking is still crap. deck shuffling algorithm is still crap, and this is me making my mono-green ramp carnage tyrant-vine mare-blanchwood combo again with % winrate. only boros at the moment comes close, and they are all the same cookie-cutter . on top of that, they cut rewards for winning games, making grinding an obscene chore while, also, allowing paid players to keep their currency --which is fine if the matchmaking was good.in every aspect, eternal has shown to be the more rewarding game. the more fun game. sure, it can have its stagnant meta decks, but more oft than not i ran into people doing something different. something that went against the mundanity of the meta.edit : wotc listened to the community for mtg:a... it feels like they planned it the entire time and were using it for good press. until they actually listen and follow up on what is being said, since closed mind, i'm not changing my stance on it.that being said, [in eternal] i joined the new league... i had terrible luck with the packs, but i still find it fun to watch. another point to this game: it pushed me to try the non-casual scene, and i enjoyed it. plus, that card back is sexy.",1

5269,"very mixed feelings about this game. i still play it a lot, and it can still be fun to play casually, but if you ever decide to go into ranked and try to improve, there are some glaring problems in the game's mechanics that cannot go unnoticed.this game is not like smash, in fact, blue mammoth games tries as hard as possible to be different from smash, so the mechanics are different and in a lot of ways, simpler. however, this does not mean the game does not take skill. in fact, i believe that brawlhalla actually has a pretty decent skill ceiling.however, becoming better at the game isn't always fun, especially when you're nearing the top. you will soon realize that the punish game in brawlhalla is ten times harder than smash, and some legends/weapons in the game are downright annoying. brawlhalla also utilizes a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block, and instead of grabbing, brawlhalla requires you to read the opponent, and although there are reading patterns people tend to follow and moves that you can use to cover multiple dodge directions, the enemy still has ways to dodge and + ways to react.i don't know why, but i haven't exactly been able to bring myself to quit the game yet. i would always rage from ranked, but come back some other day, and i think it has to do with how accessible the game is. you can load up brawlhalla and be in a ranked match playing a v in under a minute, no joke, making it a great game to play when you are short on time.tl;dr, very fun casual gameplay, aids ranked the higher you go, flawed mechanics, decent skill ceiling compared to smash (although annoying to improve at), highly accessible when short on time.also the lag holy â¥â¥â¥â¥",1

's of people on foot, in tanks, in transport trucks called sunderers, and in fighters. then after - months, i felt like i was repeating yesterday, over and over. the first impressions the game left on me vanished. i decided to stay, however, seeing i invested time, and money. but then a few months later, i noticed a decline in player activity, something i honestly expected. it dropped to mere a continent having fewer them people on it. at that point i felt like people left because of lack of content, lack of instructions, or lack of movitation. i then decided to quit my membership, and leave the game all together.now, onto the pros, and the cons.pros:> a lot of weapons and tools to use.> a lot of so called outfits that are player groups.> a good mix of land, and air vehicles to pilot.> big battlegrounds to exchange fire.> servers for different time zones.cons:> cosmetics and membership are overpriced.> weapons with in-game currency are overpriced.> requires a high-grade pc to run at decent settings.> poor tuturial level.> poor in-game mic chat.> possible unexpected game crashes.> newer players can mess up a base capture-defensethats all i was able to think of. this game isn't good. i give it a /",0

5767,"i'll narrow this down to the good and the bad points about this game. (updated //, shortly after graphics overhaul. [note!] so far these upgrades are not shown in the above screenshots)the good:-a large array of aircraft to fly(if you buy the moduls). many of which are fully interactive, as in almost every switch and button can be flipped with the click of your mouse(you can rebind the keys as you see fit). the rest of the aircraft are more like simplifed simulations, not fully interactive but easier to learn. as far as i know, they handle realisticly.-amazing graphics post update! the lighting, weather, and smoke effects are absurdly good, the ground now uses a bump map, meaning flat textures on the ground cast shadows, it really makes the terrain look a million times better. basically it just looks better and even runs better.-detailed single player campaigns for each and every aircraft, some single player campaigns very in their difficulty and legnth. for example, the a-a's campaign features smaller scale misisons that don't require much time to complete. where as the su-'s campaign features much larger scale misisons that take much longer to complete(imagine after taking off from your airfield, you must fly for - minutes to the combat zone, then fly back to land when your mission is complete, which i guess is more realistic).-quick misson generators which allow you to practice with your aircarft before doing the campaigns.-one thing i really like is that you can choose your payload, each aircraft has a large variety of weaponry, and it is fun carefully choosing your payload according your mission objective. variety is such a great thing, and variety is something this game has in large quantities.-the game is very well optimized now, it used to run like garbage even with incredeble hardware, but even after the graphics overhaul, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it did.-the load times have been vastly improved, it used to take minutes to load anything up in this game, now its about seconds to a minute to load. any subsequent load time is around seconds.bare in mind my hardware specs are as follows:amd -core . ghzr with gb of vram gddrgb mhz of ramthe bad:-expect a minor frame rate dips if our have mirrors and ground clutter active.-the game's training is hit or miss. the su-t(which you get for free) has training missions that are interactive. then you have most of the flaming cliffs aircraft which have shoddy low res videos, that is out of sync with the sound and voice that is explaining everything. for the mi-, the game will only teach you how to turn it on, take off, and how to use the weapons, but it only tells you how to use the rockets, and of the types of gun pods, and doesn't teach you how to use bombs. worst of all, it did not teach me how to land with the helicopter, which is harder than you may think. i crashed times trying to figure out how to land properly. the game has a steep learning curve, and the training videos just makes an already hard to learn game even more inaccessible.-i find that the default controles are confusing and clunky. i basically had to completely setup and rebind the contols to something more comfortable. this took a lot of time, learning what each function did, then figuring out what my new layout should be. but when your done, your done and can enjoy the game. keep in mind, you have to completely set up your controles for each indavidual vehicle!in conclusion:if i can add anything more to the review, i will. but overall, the game is great, and i highly reccomend it if you like flight simulators.",1

12672,"i have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. firstly the 'free to play' element is a cars on a tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. first thing that annoyed is the braking signs that suggest that target audience is year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift i was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when i came to a corner though. i pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and i understeered into the wall so i thought fair enough i was a bit fast but i expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). i tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a rd usually, i took it in st )giving an impovement, enough that i made it round. something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering i was doing in first in a dtm car i doubt it's either.next i took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. next the sounds, it's free to play i know but i expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel i entered was extremely underwhelming.all i can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time",0

4854,"at this point in time i have hours logged. i'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other moba's and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. smite is a rd person moba unlike most moba's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of moba and the way i prefer to play a moba.i've only played around matches of lol, and as ive said before i prefer the rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other moba'snow. to get to the basics, you have your guardians,mages,warriors,hunters and assassins, all of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.hunters- hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy tank.mages- all around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.guardians- guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.warriors- warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your v fights in late game joust.assassins- assassins are very crucial to your conquest matches (v) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being overpowered, they're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.pro's- visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, top down just isnt my cup of tea.community- all in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other moba's too me.updates-smite is regularly updated with new content very often, in the last year it's seen around new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but high-rez stays on top of it.gods-all of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and any of them can be good if they are in the right hands.cons-unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.hunters- hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play neith,ah muzen cab, xblanque and many others, but they need to be nerfed unlike league (going by word of mouth) yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, i'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, they make being a guardian not fun.guardians- there are alot of fun guardians in the game but, as ive said in the previous statement hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.i've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, i like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, you're not playing ranked-conquest. stop acting like it, thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of dota , or lol.last thing is the server downtime, i want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, but, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in the last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. i've read many articles stating that it's because of ddos from other developers, i would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. my problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. so high-rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, please, try and fix this problem.thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.i'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me. favorite gods-vulcan,agni,neith,khepri,poseidon.",1

10117,"% of the reviews on the hunter are negative because people complain about how it is marketed as a free to play game. if you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money. but after you get a membership the game becomes sooo much better. you need to be patient to play the hunter and by the looks of the other reviews, not many people on steam are. make sure you play the tutorials or you will have no idea what you are doing and maybe watch a youtube video or two (e.g. thehunter beginner's guide by hoocairsthehunter). if you are a new guest i recommend sticking to the towers and calling the deer to you, as they can see, smell and hear you alot better with guest clothes on. there is free shotgun in the store which i dont think many guests know about, so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting (don't worry about wasting ammo because it is unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge) or go pheasant hunting and if you like it, buy the membership. i also recommend going to thehunter on wikia as it gives you tonnes of information on reserves and where you can specifically find the animals.",1

6354,"don't care about the playing time. i usually launch non-steam version excepting payment.日本語と英語の二ヶ国語でのレビューに挑戦してみたいと思います。this review is written in japanese and english. sorry about my poor english. まず何より先に言っておきたいのですが、このゲームはアメリカ軍がドイツ軍より有利な条件になっています。ですが最終的にはドイツ軍側の武器も充実してきます。ドイツ側プレイヤーに求められるのは忍耐です。たとえ経験豊富なfpsプレイヤーであっても、兵士が育ちきるまでは、ドイツ側はアメリカ兵に倒されまくる事を覚悟しましょう。all what i'd like to say is us weapons of fresh soldiers are stronger than german ones in this game. of course, german weapon can be strong in the end. german players must be patient. until your trooper trained enough, you will be killed so many times even if you are experienced in first-person shooter. don't worry about the kill-death ratio. in this game, tankers usually make kill-death score or more. anyway, if you want to play on axis side, please remember these disadvantages as follows.第一に、歩兵装備の優位性です。ドイツ軍のgライフルは威力や反動の面でアメリカ軍のmガーランドに劣っています。また、ドイツ兵が最初に購入できるようになるmpサブマシンガンは装弾数が発しかないため、アメリカ兵のmグリースガンやmトンプソンと撃ち合う際に苦しい思いをすること請け合いです。サブマシンガンで戦果を挙げてリボンをlv upさせればmpを購入できるようになりますが、かなり高価(mgやt戦車よりも値段が高い)ですし、mトンプソンの火力や連射性能にはどうしても負けてしまいます。first, us infantry equipments are superior than german's ones. the damage and recoil of g rifle(german beginning rifle) are inferior than m garand(american). if you want to keep using this rifle for long time, you should improve these status by installing weapon mods. after that, this rifle will be able to defeat uncle sam with only twice body-hits in close to middle range. mp submachine gun has only rounds while m greese gun has rounds. this gap suffer german players. of course, you can purchase mp submachine gun when you earn enough exps of smg ribbon.however, its fire power and rate of fire is still worse than m thompson. in addition, the biggest problem is ... mp is so expensive. its price is higher than mg and even light tanks !!第二に、戦車の性能の差です。「ドイツ戦車といえばww最強だろ！」と考える人は少なくないと思われますが、少なくともこのゲームではドイツ戦車乗りは茨の道を歩かされることは間違いないと言えるでしょう。というのもこのゲーム、ドイツ戦車兵はまず号戦車からスタートするのですが、敵として遭遇(マッチング)する相手は、皆この戦車よりも強力です。mチャーフィどころか、mスチュアート相手にも勝機はほぼありません。具体的に言うと、高価なapcr弾を奴らの背面に打ち込んでも、まったく砲弾が貫通してくれずにノーダメージとなります。ma軽戦車が相手ならまだ勝ち目はありますが、向こうは.mm機関銃を装備しているのに対し、こちらは.mm機関銃しかないので相変わらず苦しいです。歩兵やジープを撃ってはクレジットやリボン経験値を稼ぎ、t戦車を手に入れるまでは、ひたすら苦労することでしょう。ティーガーやティーガーは確かに強力なのですが、そもそも投入できる戦場が絶対的に少ないです。なおドイツ重戦車の仮想敵はmパーシングです。secondly, the difference of the quality of tanks is serious. excepting russian, most people may believe german tanks are best in ww !!. although it might be true, in this game, german tank soldiers must walk thorny path. pz.i light tank(german beginning tank) is the worst tank, and it will be just a coffin in tank battle.this tank bring only a pair of .mm machine gun while american ma lt has .mm machine gun. for example, however when you shoot apcr(better penetration and more expensive ammo) against the back armor of m stuart or m chaffee, it can never penetrate(shoot out) their armor, even they are light tanks!! in case, against m sherman or m persing? needless to answer... so, if you want to train german tanker, i recommand you to avoid tank battle with pz.i. attack only enemy infantry and non-armored vehicles, and gain exps of light tank ribbon to buy t tank. it is the best light tank in german, and it can kill american light tank from its front. german heavy tanks are actually good, but there are only a few opportunity to cast them in standard battle.とまあ、こんな感じにドイツ側はかなりマゾい戦いを強いられますが、兵士が育って武器や車両が揃ってくれば、段々と楽しくなってきます。最初のうちは、ゲームがすぐ終わるskirmishルールの戦場でクレジットを稼ぐのが良いでしょう。like this, german player will fight under disadvantages. but, after getting well-trained soldier and purchase enough weapons, you will feel this game fun. while you are new player, you should join only skirmish battle, and earn exps and credits. skirmish mode battle takes less time thans assault mode battle.また、これは米独両軍の新兵に気をつけて欲しいのですが、雇用したての歩兵は対戦車兵器を全く持っていませんし、買えません。もちろん、初期装備の手榴弾は対人用途にしか使えず、装甲車両には全くダメージが入らないため、先述の号戦車にさえも遠距離から一方的に虐殺されかねないです。更にこのゲームの対戦車兵器は威力が弱く、紙装甲で有名なmヘルキャット相手ですら、パンツァーファウストを発は直撃させないと撃破できません。対戦車手榴弾もあるのですが、これは戦車破壊リボンのレベルがかなり上がっていないと購入できず、敵戦車に肉薄するリスクを要するにも関わらず、戦車を一撃で撃破できるred orchestraシリーズの対戦車手榴弾とは違い、このゲームの対戦車手榴弾は、軽戦車を撃破するのにすら～個の使用を必要とされます。やはり敵戦車を撃破するには、こちらも戦車を出して対抗するのが番安全なように思えます。finally, i need to tell an important thing to both us and german new players. the fresh soldier has no anti-tank weapons, and they cannot buy them yet. your anti-human grenades cause quite no damage against armor targets. it means, you can easily be slaughtered by even pz.i light tank!! and, compared with red orchestra series, the damage of anti-tank weapons is weaker and weaker. for exapmle. you will need direct hit of panzerfaust to kill m hellcat(even this tank-destroyer has only ~mm of armor). if you use anti-tank grenade(this is so risky), it also needs twice or more. using panzerschreck or ma bazooka is more damage than panzeraust, and much safer than anti-tank grenade. but their prices are so expensive. after consuming all rounds, you need to supply them at the same prices of buying new ones. as the result, when you get suffered by enemy tanks and you want to eliminate them, you should cast a tank, like enemy does.",1

14900,"! ! ! update ! ! !will revise review when eac stops blocking test mode and unsigned drivers. would be positive otherwise.---take a game with a good concept and throw in every con known to mankind, and you have robocraft, the game you want to love but want to strangle to death at any given time. robocraft wants to be a good game that can allow players from around the world make their own tanks/planes/mechs/flying pinwheels and pit them against everyone else's, except that it fails on every part on what a good multiplayer experience should have and soon becomes boring, repetitive, and rage inducing.in robocraft, you can make just about anything you want to a degree (but more on that later). you have many options of movement from wheels that let you tread around the terrain to hoverblades that let you cushion some air between you and the hard ground. advanced players can arm themselves with wings and take to the skies or mix everything together into some monstrosity that were not meant for the eyes of mere mortals. from the start, you get robots to work with and garages for each one. each also demonstrates the unique weapons of the game: the sub machine gun, the plasma cannon, and the railgun.let's talk about the weapons: the sub machine gun is you standard 'smg'; high fire rate, decent accuracy, and good effective range. they are the only weapon (at this time) to have two varieties: front mounted and top mounted, with front mounted being able to lay on the face of a cube and top mounted being best for being on top of a cube. the plasma cannon is an arcing explosion-on-hit weapon that requires some skill to use, but once mastered, it can easily be one of the better weapons in the game. it is only trumped by the railgun, which might as well be the 'point and kill' weapon. the smg and plasma gun do not have block penetrating damage (though the plasma has splash damage), whereas the railgun does. while it's balancing factor is that it takes seconds to reload, this creates a problem because of how the game determines 'death.'in your design of a mech (robot, mech, at this point, the game doesn't really seem to define what on earth you are building), you have a pilot seat, which is where your pilot sits. for a game called 'robocraft', this seems out of place, and in gameplay, it is. it is a 'block' that consists of blocks outwards and blocks in height. it must rest on two blocks underneath and those two blocks are your only lifeline. let me repeat: two blocks define if you are alive or dead. remember the railgun's penetration ability? it didn't get the nickname 'point and kill' sitting around drinking on a summer beach (the plasma cannon is no better). your dream robot better have a huge underbelly because that is your only way to survive, but even then that only gives you a slightly better chance at not dying.so let's talk about gameplay. at the moment, there is only one game mode: capture the point. a team wins by sitting on their enemy's base until the timer gods are satisfied with your demonstration of doing nothing or you can kill the enemy team in your quest for showing off your mad plasma cannon skills. this is all assuming you survive the first seconds of the match. the game's physics engine is your first real enemy: assuming there is at least one impatient person on your team (pro tip: there always will be one), you may run into the situation that just a gentle bump will send your robotic death machine into a flying whirl that can only be achieved in a cartoon. if you land right side up, proceed to call that teammate a moron and move on. if you don't, congratulations: you are now target practice for the enemy railgunners and plasma cannon users until either they kill you (and your two blocks too), or the match ends. you can quit the game at this point with the penalty of taking % damage (more on that later).assuming you survive the onslaught called 'lack of teamwork', the network engine will come out to play. 'warping', or when an entity moves from place to place due to network latency, is common and the same happens with their bullets. this can make smgs get magical penetrating powers and make enemies appear to attempt a re-run at flipping you over like the impatient teammate whose mech looked like a fried egg. this doesn't have a lot but when it does happen, you can join the therapy party for everyone else who died from the same reason, and that party is at least a third of the player base.so about damage in the game. the game's definition of 'damage' is the total health of your mech, which is mostly attributed by what blocks you used, since each one's armor value is different depending on which ones you do use. if a set of blocks becomes disconnected, that is considered to be doing a massive amount of damage and your health will plummet like most of your hopes and dreams of what could be achieved in the game. any damage you receive at the end of a match (including if one of the two blocks providing your pilot leg room gets destroyed) must be repaired at the cost of either the in-game currency or actual money. remember that % that you lose if you quit the game early? that also falls under your bill and if you get flipped over after taking damage, the % is only tacked on to what you have. this makes any earnings you received from the game get minimized even further. the game has a 'bonus engine', but the rules for that are to laugh at any player trying to actually achieve it: you must not die and your team must win. this means if your team wins but you were sacrificed to ensure victory, congratulations: you haven't appeased the robocraftian gods enough for a pay raise. will that be cash or cash?surely there has to be a way to keep the game balanced, and the game's attempt at it is laughable at best. there are tiers, with each tier under the assumption that the weapons and armor of that tier is better. unfortunately, this isn't the real world situation. you can be shoved into a higher tier due to using more blocks for your beach ball of doom or because of the weapon's lethality. on top of that, assuming you have evenly matched lethality and good looks, the matchmaking will often pit you against tiers to above your own. suddenly those pair of sunglasses you added aren't looking so hot and floorless pilot is you with the enemy team's highest tier mech mowing your fellow team's tier mechs for target practice.the icing on the cake is the map selection, and unlike the flavor selection at your dairy queen, you have only to choose from, two being ice and the other being on mars. if you have the misfortune to be rocking out with tires on the ice area, have fun on the ice river that each ice map offers, as it has a physical property where you will glide forever in one direction despite how much you try to turn and reverse the other way. you will grow thankful for how other games interprets ice physics after experiencing robocraft's interpretation. mars doesn't really have much going for it and the blandness will make you wish for another map, all of which are chosen randomly while matchmaking, which is the only option you have (no picking a match, no choosing an enemy platoon to face).in closing, robocraft is the game that wants to be unique and enjoyable, but falls flat on its face on its own ice physics only shortly after tripping over its own flaws. i haven't even covered its 'premium membership' and other obvious ploys to earn money quickly and with as little effort as possible, but those would only add insult to injury. give robocraft a try for an hour, but turn away and don't come back afterwards. at least until they get their act together and actually try listening to what little of a community they have.",0

6372,"heroes and generals is now out of early access, so lets take a look!excellent foundation, good technical achievements, incredibly poor design choices and missing management.that about sums it up. but lets elaborate on that.the foundation of the game- the battles themselves as infantryman are good. vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal. the physics and gun system are good, once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game, and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs. but then there are things missing, and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for. prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective, and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point.flanking works well, you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms, but this is not really used that much. you can use it all, be the ultimate soldier, and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets. there is no penalty for dying- not for you at least, but more on that later, and you don't really get rewarded for anything you do either. you play to play, and you win because you want to win.then lets get right to the poor design choices. this game is not just pay to win, but pay to progress. the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game. do you want to group up with a few friends? if there's more than two, then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the 'skill' of having a group. after that, prepare for a lot more grind, as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier. and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades, you're going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications, because every single bullet shot, grenade thrown, mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot. this leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentality;life is cheap. ammo is expensive.if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because times out of it will be better than yours, even if you've spend + hours on the game.of course there are other issues, mainly around balance and the 'generals' portion of the game. i'll spare you the complaints on balance- it's the usual for pay to win games, but more on that other bit later.that said, if you don't mind the grind, and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours(+) the basic infantry combat is good stuff. moving along to tanks you will find that they're not amazing, but certainly entertaining and useful. your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well. airplanes are a joke and they likely always will be, do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them. controls are awful, planes don't do anything, and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful. prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything.and then on to the big complaint with this game, when you're not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money. the generals part.it may as well not exist.the game may even be better if it did not exist.the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable.first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it. then you will need to spend + days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them. they will die in about minutes and they will have gained no experience. everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the devs money for it, which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them. the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy- merely people throwing their units around hoping it works. sometimes it does work too, but this is never because of any skill at command.it all comes down to the people playing the war battles. and they don't care. people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at. because they don't have to pay for those tanks. the guy who got the tank brigade does. same for airplanes, infantry spawns and vehicles. why would they care that you've waited days to get your infantry squad filled? they will run into machinegun fire and then respawn to do it again until you lose your squad. they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have infantry spawns and vehicle spawns and they fight infantry and vehicles. and because these vehicles despawn after use, they are gone and they remain gone. the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics, a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game.and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun. a game with great ideas, pretty good technical achievements, but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesn't care either. greed above all else, and a complete lack of awareness.long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept, good basic gameplay, and claimed to have plans to make it better. i wanted to support them, since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great.i regret that.i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use. the game isn't better than it was back then. it's worse, and it's showing no signs of ever improving.",0

14937,"- counter-strike: robo offensiveno one likes these damn crates. it's a cheap pay-to-win method of sucking the fun out of people who are reluctant to fling their wallets at freejam.- backwards evolution somehow this game seemed to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throwing every player they can find into matches.- overpowered weapons no one asked forit feels like freejam procrastinated so long they forgot they had to make an update, so they just decide to throw in a new, poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress.- removal of mega botsi see no real reason why this was even done. it's as if they removed them without knowing why they wanted to or what they were going to do from there.- craftingthis isn't an update. freejam literally just replaced the word in the code. this could've been done by anyone who has even taken coding classes in high school. again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around cluelessly trying to figure out why the popularity of robocraft is dropping faster than stock prices on black thursday.- removal of armored blocksagain no clue what they were going for here. it was fair and balanced, pretty much a major factor in what made robocraft unique. it seems like a good third of my grinding in robocraft was to get better armored blocks, and there they go wiping days of effort.- it's just too complicated for it's own goodand not in a good way. you can jam all kinds of new content into your game faster than ever before, but that won't make it any better if you don't slow down and put time and effort into it. sh*t plus sh*t just equals bigger sh*t.- removal on limitations of gun typesletting every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time removes most, if not all diversity in robots, all creativity and design.= in my opinion, that was most of the things the community doesn't like about this game. it's very simple to find out what they dont like as several people have done the very same thing i just did.+ statement from freejamfreejam has recently announced that they would be partially fixing some of these issues, such as the crates and tiers. they have even stated they want to remove all ways to buy parts with real money. this is the first positive thing they want to add to robocraft in a long time.~ if robocraft holds true on their plans, i will be more than happy to change my reccomendation for this game.",0

5449,"i've played the app for a few hours before this came out, and i have + hours, wn and recent wn on the actual world of tanks game.this game is much more fast pased, and more forgiving. there aren't, to my knowledge, extraneous skill mods like xvm so it's less competitive and you are able to relax more. i was given gold and days of premium just for starting the game which is a huge boost and makes it easier to play and learn. this game is relaxing compared to wot and i don't have as much commitment or salt as a result (so it's quite fun to play). v tank combat, unlike any fps around. tanks have varying levels of penetration, damage, and armor (as well as many more nuances) that change how they are supposed to fight. you need to either kill all enemies or cap their base to win the battle. battles last on average about minutes, but it could be more or less depending on your team and if people try to camp/hide. there are over tanks in the actual world of tanks, and blitz has a couple hundred as well (i'm not sure how varied it is, but there are some differences). you have loads of tank styles to try and it's hard not to find something you like to play.tl;dr: relaxing and lower skill floor compared to the full/actual world of tanks game, much less demanding on pc resources, fun v pvp tank shooter. it's free to play so give it a try, the really fun tanks are around tier !",1

3838,"this game is fascinating. i remember i tried playing it a year ago but i sucked so i gave up on it, even though i played for about fifteen minutes. i tried it again this year, because i read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. i'd laugh it off, thinking it can't be that bad.after almost two months of playing, i can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. perhaps worse.the first few weeks the liking was soft, i liked the game, the meet the videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but i was extremely bad at first, kills, deaths type of bad. i dominated just one player every two rounds; and i even got really excited when i got a revenge (jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). that's how bad, and even nby i was. i was coming back to online pc gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. but then, when i started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when i'd become friends with my pocket medics or the people i was a pocket medic to... life changed. this game literally consumed me. i wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and i ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. i'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. now it's gotten to the point in which i've played hours straight of tf with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. with a lot of effort i got up myto work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because i wanted to play. the game's just special like that, ya'know? it's fun. it's unique, creative. and i love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. and it's just generally very addictive.my point? this game is f*cking terrible. i don't give a cr*p if it's free, don't install it. it will consume you and ruin you. f*cking run. run while you still can!!! (i still recommend it, though. just because you'll have a lot of fun)now, if you'll excuse me, i'll get back to playing.",1

2341,"this is an arpg for people who like to experiment with a huge variety of skills and builds. there are so many possible combinations that the mind boggles. some good, some great, others... not so good.it's the not so good skills and combinations, and the initially slow pace and limited options in the early stages of the game that might put off new players, as you may progress so far into the game with a self-made build and find that it just doesn't tie up well with your choices in the vast passive skill tree. i'd highly recommend new players look up guides on builds on the poe forums, or it could become frustrating when you realise that it'll be faster to start a new character from level than to try and fix your current build. for this reason, it's totally understandable that some players just may not have the patience for such things, and dislike the game, and that's ok. high armour and life-based melee builds are a pretty good, easy to gear, starter option to get you to that end game, sunder builds, for example, can be quite tanky and has a bit of range and aoe so is safe and can level quickly.that said, the game doesn't really get started until you've completed the story acts and gain access to the map device. maps are where the end game begins, the toughest bosses live and best loot can be found. it's here that you'll begin to finalise your build and gear with the right crafting enchantments and ascendancy class, a branch of your main class that adds additional benefits and utility depending on exactly what you want from your build. you'll choose this class while progressing through the story, before even making it to maps, so choose wisely.in terms of game performance, an ssd is highly recommended and a good cpu, although there has been constant improvements over the years to particle effects and engine optimization which has helped greatly with reducing desync and reduced framerates when lots of skill effects are going off, though this can still be a problem when playing in groups.as a fp game it is top notch, there are no pay-to-win microtransactions, everything available in the shop are purely cosmetic items to give your characters weapons, armour and skills a new look.new leagues with new mechanics and content are released every few months so there's always something to come back to, even if it's not your cup of tea this time, next league might have something you enjoy.overall, considering my number of hours played, i have to recommend you try it for yourself.",1

12651,"forget the pricing model, it's not the best, get over it! this is the most underrated racing sim on steam, hands down. i use a triple monitor setup with a gtx , intel i, and logitech driving force gt with added clutch pedal.compared to rfactor : raceroom blows it away with graphics, but i think the physics in rfactor is a small knotch more realistic.compared to automobilista: more modern feeling, can't exactly explain why, but raceroom just feels more nuanced.compared to project cars: project cars graphics are better, but the physics are a bit simcade for my taste.compared to assetto corsa: these two games are tied for my favorite sim racers. i would consider them very similar sims.compared to iracing: don't know, i'm not a fan of the subscription pricing model because the cost is astronomical in the long run. how much would i have paid for my atari games by now if they were subscription pricing? i'm not a big fan of dlc or drm at all, for that matter, but the subscription pricing is the worst, in my opinion.compared to everything: the audio for this game is the gold standard. if you are a hardcore sim racer, and own all the others, get this for the audio experience, if nothing else. i mean, it is free. the few cars and tracks are enough to keep you entertained for a while, and there is also a $ dlc package with a lot of stuff.",1

6173,"this game is most likely the worst game i have ever played in my life. for the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game. then comes level . after level the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either pw f***, or just people who have played longer. if you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. your gun takes - hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend - seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? and if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are times worse. they camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. if you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. the player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. but, the game has to have tanks. you cant have a wwii war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. in assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish) let's move on to the economy. every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. you also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. any half decent gun costs $,+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. the game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but i have hours into the game and still have trash weapons. i'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so i can get better weapons. [edit ]: oops! silly me, i forgot about one of the most important things! you might be thinking okay, this game is in beta, it still has potential, right? well, this latest update made me think wrong. the soviet union was added as a faction (team) to the game. now, first of all, for the majority of the war the u.s. and the soviet union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. i dont. what i do care about is the fact that they made the soviet union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior; especially the ppd-. the ppd is a round mag smg. compared to the m grease gun and the mp, its totally op. the next smg you get is the ppsh. once again, round mag, upgradable to rpm (rounds per minute). shots at rpm = op. [edit ]: as you can see, my hours have raised since i wrote this review. now, this is not because i'm a hypocrite, its becuase my little brother hasn't realized that this game is not a good game, and everyday forces me to play with him. once he realizes, just like me, that this is not a good game, i will have no reason to play it.[edit ]: let's also talk about at (anti-tank). tanks in this game are completely unbalanced, especially in skirmish, but at least the developers were kind enough to give us infantry a way to kill tanks. mines, sticky grendes, and rocket launchers. for grenades and mines, you have to be right up near the tank, which is impossible to do if they are camping or have infantry guarding them. rocket launchers are a little bit better, but they take up so much inventory space you can only cary a sa-rifle or a ba-rifle, and you can barely sprint. the other thing is that the game doesn't want people destroying tanks, so they make the at weapons so overpriced they are literally unusable. sticky grenades are the best example. it takes sticky grenades to destroy a tank. the cost of using sticky grenades is credits. (average salary per game = - credits). you are paying a large chunk of your salary to destroy one tank, and the tank driver has to pay maybe -.[edit ]: one other thing. the game's matchmaking sometimes decides to match you in a game that is already almost over, meaning you will automatically be paid credits. if you are like me and your gun is very expensive to maintain, you are losing alot of money by playing.",0

14945,"it's hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played ever-so-often. they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i. i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made, and that these team-based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times, as every time i upgraded my parts, i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do. trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted, and flight is just as bad. there is no way in hell, as a beginner class, are you going to be able to fly decently in this game, especially after the most recent patches i last saw. the game's devs have basically ed with the game so much, that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it (which was two years ago). it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with. (in other words: if it isn't broken, don't fix it).and it's surprisingly still in early access.i still don't understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement, because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it.the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot, whether on wheels, feet, or in the air; the creativity part of this game is what makes it good. the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are, which, in order to get any more of these things, you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts, and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs. how much you actually get per round.",0

(boneknapper for example. cool dragon, bad stats. can't race, and there are better dragons for ship battles. the only two uses that a dragon can have, besides for looks. races and battle events.)-kind of a dragon collecting game because of the above. i've seen veteran players flex their entire collection of dragons on other players. that's pretty much all you can do with most of them.-not only are most dragons essentially useless, but they cost gems! which you're supposed to spend real money on!*i mean, if you like running and flying around interacting with people, this is a good game for that. oh and quests. they run out after a while though. can't replay them after that. then you need to make a new viking.*yeah, microtransactions suck, but the game doesn't have the best security against people who want to exploit the game. it was especially bad in or so. anyone could get infinite gems. years later, there are still exploits that need to be fixed.*overall a decent game if you like collecting dragons and flying them around, and are willing to deal with getting gems for them. just don't buy gems though, only try membership if you're thinking about it. i play this game to decompress. it's not that fast paced.*i would not recommend sod to a friend to play a game. it's more about the social aspects than playing a game. you would likely have more fun interacting with people than racing or doing battle events. however, sod isn't the only place you can talk to people, so that doesn't make this particular game stand out much.*i'd like to see more gameplay added in, like other dueling options than fireball frenzy, or another use for dragons like the boneknapper. he's average with speed and firepower, but he has a lot of armor and spikes. maybe there can be a new minigame where bulky dragons can destroy things with melee attacks.*they're starting to improve the graphics in some areas, like the training grounds and the school, which is nice :) the water at the school is honestly the best looking part of the game.graphics: /gameplay: /fun factor: /gets boring after a while. i log on every once in a while to fly around, then log off. flight is one of those mechanics in games that are kind of hard to come by, especially if it's both free flight and it's an integral part of the game. to compare with mmorpgs like riders of icarus and world of warcraft, these two games are just overdone and too detailed. i like school of dragons because of its simplicity and focus on the dragons. it also isn't an eyesore for me, compared to roi or wow. there's just a lack of content in-game. more things to do than quests, battle events, and races would be a good place to start working.",0

10664,"though eternal is, as of the time of this review, still technically in early access, the game is very polished and quite well done. i have a played a few other ccgs in additional to eternal, but i only play eternal now for two primary reaasons:. the gameplay is just vastly superior, especially being able to interact on your opponent's turn.. the fp model is very generous. though i have spent some money to support dwd, i have not really needed it for anything - just playing the game gives you more than enough resources to do whatever you want. though there are a few decks that i personally prefer, i have enough in-game resources to build at least - tier one decks right now if i chose to do so.i have enjoyed playing eternal very much - the gameplay is solid, the metagame is quite varied, and you really do need to know what you are doing in order to play optimally - your deck does not play itself and even very small decisions can be quite meaningful.",1

4568,"this review is for those who are already familiar with mobas and have played dota or league of legends. i will point out what makes smite unique compared to those games.- third person camera perspective. unlike the classics, smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character. this allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability. - (almost) every ability in the game has to be aimed, including melee and ranged basic attacks! that's right, if you want to play the ad carry in smite, prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can't land your basic attacks. same goes for everything else: if you can't hit your abilities reliably, you will not succeed, there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed. from the other perspective, this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations. many times i was one hit away from death, but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements, i survived. - playable characters (heroes, champions) in smite are real gods from pantheons that were once (and some still are) worshipped. norse, roman, mayan, hindu, chinese, greek. play as zeus, thor, odin, loki and many other gods and mythical creatures. hirez studios does a (mostly) great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable characters. and for those deities you don't know, there is always a lore section for every god, so you even learn something about different cultures while you play. yay, knowledge!- different game modes + one that changes every day. unlike its competitors, smite features many different game modes aside from the classical vs (here called conquest). arena (vs, no lanes, team deathmatch), siege (vs, two lanes, small jungle), joust (vs, lane, small jungle), assault (vs, all random all mid, lane). the mode of the day changes every day and features fun setups (like vs on the assault map and everyone get's the same god).all of these game modes have their own, detailed and well crafted map. in conquest mount olympus opposes a vulcano, in arena you fight in a grand colloseum, in assault you defend the halls of asgard from the forces of chaos, in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforests and in joust you're a knight for some reason (it will be changed to a chinese themed map soon). in addition to that, smite features one of the best deals in a free to play game: the god pack. the god pack costs $ and contains every god currently in the game. owners of the god pack also receive the newest god as soon as they're released. forever. that means, the more gods join the battle of smite, the more value you get for your $. you do the math. why should you play smite over league or dota? if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas, but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones, smite will be the game for you. it's highly skill-based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional mobas do not have. i played league of legends for years, but after i got athritis (this is a joke) from playing adc and kiting for too long, i gave up. for me, smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional mobas never did. i will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about smite, i am not delusional:many skins in smite are locked behind chests, which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them, you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want. it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god is announced, only to later find out it's in a chest with other items. hirez abuses this a bit too much. though we have the god pack, so that balances it out.eu servers can be very unreliable. quality control at hirez is either non-existent or very bad. some new gods release in a pitiful state, either balance or design-wise. they have horrid animations, amateur-like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered. some god designs are also very questionable. sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their lore, or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense. did you know the spartans put the statues of ares, the god of war, in chains to restrain him? yeah, that's cool, but only a small footnote in his lore. well, what hirez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact. he shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield. the shield has a demonic visage on it, where the fire comes out. does that sound like the greek god of war to you? not to me. but these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience. i've been playing this game for more than a year, and only looking forward. it's free in the end, so why not try it out and look for yourself?",1

8742,"so i played this game quite alot when it originally came out in early access and i thought it was great. it was a innovative take on the battle royale genre and me and my friends had a great time playing it. i didnt play it for several months, not because it was bad, but because there where other releases that i wanted to try out aswell. today, the th november, i played it once again only to discover that there are now bots in the game. bots in a battle royale game destroys the whole concept. i would rather have long queue times and met actual human players than get fast queues where only % of the enemies you face are actual players. if a minute queue gets me humans and bots, wouldnt a minute queue get me a full map of only human players? i dont really see the reasoning behind the bots if not to cover up long queue times. you will notice the bots right away, the ai is really poor and they struggle with stairs, walls and always run in a straight line making them really easy targets to hit. this is really sad, this game was really fun and i like the changes they have made during early access even though i think the drastic changes every week was what made people stop playing it. but adding bots is a sure way to kill the player base. if it wasnt for the bots i would have probably played this for a few weeks now with my friends, switch games for a couple of weeks and then return and continue to do so for a long time, but with bots in the picture i dont see myself coming back to this ever again.",0
