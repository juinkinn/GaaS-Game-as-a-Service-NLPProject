114,"this game is amazing. from looking at it, it doesn't look as fun as it seems, but it really is fun. especially since it's free, its a great game for anyone looking for something to do for a few hours and likes some jumpscares. waiting on the next update, since i already got to room 760. 10/10",1

9069,"so far, this is the closest game i have seen that actually resembles all-out war. massive amounts of players, all attacking each other at the same time, each with different sides, strategies and weapons. pretty good maps, as well. the classes seem rather basic at first, but then there are all the different weapons, upgrades, abilities and strategies that can be used with each one. a (seemingly) very well thought out game. it also incorporates the social aspect of gaming, by allowing the creation of outfits, platoons and squads.my only problems with it are the not-so-brilliant graphics, mainly the player models, and the fact that a great deal of in-game items require game currency that needs to be purchased for real money, or a lot of farming (can you farm pcs, or is it an npc-specific thing?). the grahics are, compared to those of some games, pretty good, but aren't great, even on the highest graphics quality setting. overall, however, it is a pretty good game with some good ideasrating:graphics: 6 / 10weaponry (variation): 10 / 10weaponry (realism): 9 / 10world: 9 / 10overall: 8.5",1

4697,"don't let steam hours fool you, i've been playing this since beta on the normal client. i literally downloaded this on steam just to throw my two cents in: i'll just say this: if you enjoy other mobas, you'll most likely enjoy smite. that being said, the game is undergoing a major shift, and the developers are jumping ship. they're going from hi-rez-example employee name to titan-example employee name. this is being used to distinguish between the two groups of hirez. one is project titan, and the other is simply hirez. you can expect the eventual dropping of the original devs, to the new ones. half of the problems that the game is currently facing, is due to inconsistency. i'll explain: most players, whether they're new or old, can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent. this being that you can queue for a match, and if you're lucky enough to get in, and not you are unable to be matched, and are now the highest queue) which literally resets your queue for another 10-15 minutes. if you're lucky to get in, you'll see one of two things; one or multiple people on your team that are exceedingly low-level, and shouldn't be in your games, or one or more enemies that are low-level, and shouldn't be in your games. either way, it's simply not enjoyable. rofl-stomping some poor guy thats a low-level, when he shouldn't be in your game, isn't fun for anyone. it's not fun for him, and it's not fun for me. and it actually has a high chance of running new players away.match-making inconsistency is more often than not, the cause for player-frustration: i've been playing since the beta, and i'm burned out. i played literally 10 games in a row, and literally had trash players on my team, that threw the game. i should never be paired with less than 120's, that's sloppy match-making. playing with friends should be fun: i've played countless hours with friends, and one design flaw remains; whomever queues for the game, and is the party leader, rules the match-making. i'm normally the party leader, and we typically get players between 100-160, aside from the low-levels we get teamed with. and while this is fine, we have a few players that are new, and have difficulty keeping up with players that are +100. so to remedy this, we'll have our low-level player host, and queue for matches, and thats where it becomes apparent that the match-making is literal trash. because if he queues the party, we go up against players that are his level, not mine. hirez claims that the match making takes the cumulative level of the party, and match-making-rating, and queues them with the players closest to themselves. well we just proved that's . so now we're in a game with players under 30, and i'm 130. so i have two options; i can rofl-stomp these low-level players, or i can hang back, and let them experience the game. i don't want to throw the game for us, but i don't want to be that player, thats farming lowbies. that's not fun for anyone, and i want the player base to keep growing, not shrinking. god/class favoritism is rampant: you can clearly see which gods/classes are favored more than any of them, just by looking at the numbers. there are currently 98 gods; out of those 98, there are 29 mages, 20 assassins, 18 hunters, 14 warriors, and 17 guardians. mages are the most overpowered, and thusly the most played. there are mages that are so ridiculous, you can't close the gap, to actually get to them. this can be seen with gods like ah puch, discordia, baron, nox, zeus, vulcan, etc. it's exceedingly rare that mages are bad. however, there are many gods that are simply in a terrible state, such as ratatoskr, pele, artio, terra, jing wei, nike, osiris, etc. part of this issue, is that hirez balances gods strictly around conquest, their main mode. the funny thing is, most people don't play conquest, they play arena, and assault. to this end, the game is unbalanced, severely. you jump into an assault, which is a 5v5 with random gods across the board, and you fight an ah puch, you're basically screwed. he can keep more pressure on you, than most players can get around. if your team doesn't get a mage, you're basically screwed. gods like pele, are fantastic, in conquest. she's designed to be a jungler, and is the current best jungler out. that being said, on any other mode besides conquest, she's utter trash. this is part of a major problem for smite, balancing the game for a mode that most people don't play (as admitted too by hirez execs) doesn't work. it leads to people quitting due to frustration, when all they want to do, is play the damned game, and have fun, which is what games are supposed to be.smite is literally flooded with t cosmetics, that do nothing but take space in chests, to prevent you from actually getting the skin you want. you have 1 god skins 2 ward skins 3 avatars 4 loading frames 5 pedestals 6 social emotes 7 recall skins 8 hud themes 9 loading screen backgrounds 10 jump stamps 11 fountain skins 12 level-up skins 13 death marks 14 titles 15 music themes 16 announcer packs 17 vgs voice packsand you can bet yourthat all of these are filled the brim with absolute trash that you don't want, but is just there as filler for chests. hirez is incredibly greedy, and literally throws cosmetics in the way, to make you spend more gems(real world money) onyou don't want, just so you can maybe get the skin you want. i can't prove it, but i'm certain that chests are rigged, so you only get the good skins at the end of the chests. to put it simply, if you pay 200 gems for one chest rolls, you'll most likely get and seeing as there are mostly 55 items in one chest, you're going to be shelling out aton of money just to maybe get the skin you want. this needs to be changed. the sheer greed of hirez shows in literally everything they do. these are only a few of the problems: there are so many bugs, and issues in this game, it's absolutely insane. in it's current state, i would not recommend anyone plays this, unless you're interested in sub-par games, and shoddy matches.",0

15998,"this game shows many things i love, great graphics, great performance, and high social aspect. i run this game on a beat down laptop and it still runs perfectly, never ever had a frame skip. i teamed up with players around me to beat a boss, and then said thanks and went on with my adventure. i'm not sure how much the cross-platforming is adding to the player base, but ive never been in an area with no one in it. but sadly, the cons. crafting is expensive and takes a long time. the materials needed are sometimes terrifying to think about timewise. and don't get me started on quests. i started a kill 20 quest and then after that picked up another quest that said collect 20 and it was basically killing the same monster. the grind is very real in this game, and it is what brings it down to not enjoyable. i havent seen a party system for the general area yet, so i cant team with anyone and have their kills count towards mine unless i hit someones monster. in the end, this game manages to keep player-base by long tedious quests that are poorly thought out. the dialogue is very enjoyable though. 4/10 if this was the full game, 6/10 because it's early access and can still change (i hope). maybe wait a little for this one, or play an hour to see what i mean.edit: after this review i've continued to drop on, so it's addicting, just a pain in the neck",0

1024,"for an early access game, it is very well done. the controls are responsive and combat feels very fluid. the ship models are well detailed and beutiful. unfortunatly, they are the best looking objects in the game, with space stations and asteroids looking very polygonal (think n64 graphics with much better draw distance). there are a number of bugs. some only cause the ui to crash, but i have been crashed to desktop a few times.overall, i would reccomend this game. the core gameplay is great, and while it does have the occasional bug, and the graphics are pretty bad, you have to remember that this is an early access game.7/10",1

15973,"aq3d is a cross-platform rpgmmo, and not only that, but it is an open-beta one. much of the hate i see for this game are people comparing it to wow, or other high-end games of the genre, but the simple fact is that the game is unfinished, and also made by a team who has never done a 3d game on this scale before. it is constantly being updated and added onto by a dev team that care about the input of the community, with areas from the early stages of production being revamps and brought up to higher standards as the devs learn new skills and tricks, being able to pull off more interesting mechanics. no class locks, and you can change your class whenever you want(unless you are currently in combat), with new unlockable classes being added over time. the game is a work in progress, but someday it may live up to its older brothers in popularity, aq and aqw. if you are mildly interested, download, play for a couple hours, delete if you don't have fun, it's a free game.",1

21167,"in some ways i suppose, especially for screen prompts. but there are other advantages as well.first off, as a frequent person on the steam controller sub reddit where we also help people with crap related to any pad they're trying to configure with steam's software besides steam's own one, i've been seeing an increasing number of xbox pads not working right out of the box with wireless. this is pretty preposterous for ms of all people. (though sometimes fixable with a firmware flash on the pad, which can't be done wirelessly and some people don't have a cable for it)but as far as features go, the ps5 one will also have the advantage of the gyro if you can get a game to use it the way you want to anyway, and the touch pad. steam's pad tools can alter what any of these (and the rest of the pad) do. i'm not sure what else they added support for on there, i know the ps4 ones you could change the light bar color too.as for the gyro, people like to knock gyro but it's actually really exceptional on 2 hand pads when using it for higher accuracy combined with another movement method for bigger movements. admittedly though, this is extremely good on the steam controller, think mileage is gonna vary more on anything where your main movements is with a right stick though, as steam's touch pads are just excellent for camera movement via mouse, what can i say.that is why i say your mileage will vary with gyro though. you'd want to combine it with right stick, and i dunno how well that'd go, in comparison. also, some games freak out with 2 stick inputs for one stick. others, you could just make the gyro mouse, or could make the stick mouse and gyro mouse in steam and it'd mesh better, if the stick doesn't feel shitty. i guess i could probably go on about the options in that software all day though lol.",1

4814,"this was once one of, if not, my favorite games. the base concept of the game is amazing. it is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. the problem lies within the developer, hirez (or titanforge whatever they are called now).if i had to give this game a rating on just the base game and how fun it is, i'd give it a 8.5/10yes, i still play very frequently. but it's only ever with my friends and never alone. i have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but i don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. i've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. i've simply learned too many things and played so much that i would say that i am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.the matchmaking is just a joke. honestly. i don't need to say more than that. matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get yourpushed in.there are very frequent patches, one or two a month. a new god is also released everyone 1.5-2ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. the problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for litearlly years. yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since 2014 and was fixed only recently. 4 years! and even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in 30 seconds or something like that.the skins in this game are amazing to be fair. they look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. there's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get 1 or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire year.again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. certain gamemodes like siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. the game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.it's also frustrating that this year hirez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on mixer instead of twitch. this is when i realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on mixer than there would be on twitch. not to mention that the smite world championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to smite through twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.i think i have put more time into this game than any other game i have ever played. i love this game, but i cannot stress how terrible it feels to play it. i enjoy it far less and sometimes i'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. i feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. i have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest. the problem is that i am in the majority.overall, i just couldn't reccommend this game to anyone in the current state that it is in. i have 2k+ hours on steam alone but i played before it was even on steam. i love this game so much, but hirez is not a good company for smite. they don't know what they are doing.thanks for reading my rant lmao",0

8917,"oh, planetside 2. how glorious you are. massive 2,000 player servers, spread across 3 different continents and across 3 warring factions, oh glory be.being a f2p game (free to play), you don't have a reason to at least not try the game out. that is if your computer can handle it. previously, the game was extremely poorly optimized for amd cpu's, and t hat has recently changed. where i was once getting 12 frames in large biodome fights, i'm now giving it 45 bonus points.now, the game is an infantry-vehicular combat game. the 3 factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains. every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier, you use infantry resources, same goes with c4, personal med-kits and the highly useful and badass max suits. vehicles take the apropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it, cost more.now, the three factions are all similar yet very different, both aesthetically and performance wise. the new conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the vannu sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy, no bullet drop but dow low damage. each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane, heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well.now, planetside 2 is a free-to-play title, but don't let that scare you away. most games have a pay-to-win model to be more precise, whre as long as you just dump money into the game, you will have much improved gear over others, and this is why most f2p games fail, but not ps2. the only thing real money is good for in ps2 is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowence of 500 sc (station cash) per month and an xp and cert bonus. certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while sc is used to purchase weapons skipping the arning of certs as well as customization options such as camos, helmets, and emblems on your soldier and vehicles.you can not buy certs outright, which is where the balancing is. each weapoin can be moddified heavily with weapoin attatchments which alter their performance drastically from 1x red dot sights to 20x sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips. it all depends. these are purchased using certs. you earn 1 cert per 1000 xp in game. while the weapon may be bought with sc and skip the 1000 cert price point, the attachments must be earned through play.i know this review is all over the place, but if you like fps's on a massive scale, skip that battlefield 4 64 player nonsense and jump right inot an amazing free game, planetside 2.",1

9767,"it makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win. there is nothing in this game that you have to buy. there are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. i've been playing this game since back when there were only 4 classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. the items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. there are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier pve experience. the only thing that i can say is a usual must pay is the second b slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $8 other than that you don't have to buy anything, i've never expanded my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy. now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2d side scrolling with 3d elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. each character currently in the game has 3 jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. all and all the games pve is superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. now for the pvp, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. it comes in the form of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and a base race game mode. where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. the biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in pve where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. overall i believe that this is a great mmo that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.",1

11940,"i'll echo what many others are saying. no, just no. i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an mmo. but given that bless has been an ongoing project since 2012 and released in 3 regions prior to steam. there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years. trust me, save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first. ~60million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west...promotion/marketing- they advertised this game as local, optimized and new combat mechanism. upon 2-days early (of early) release this is not the case by a long shot. they marketed to your hype and released none of it. matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas. i get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better. optimzation is just not there...you have to edit your own ini files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine 3/dx9...yeah, a dinosaur. new combat! after many complained about the new combat beign removed (except for zerkers) to polish it more...this...this is not beign transparent after happily stealing dlc money. to make it clear, if they said it in advance, many wouldve been ok in waiting. emmisary event-was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release. emmisaries were youtubers to try/represent or even help hype the game. many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs. apparently some drama went down with them too. needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status. early 2day launch- needless to say that it was a waste of time. one thing is to wait in queue, another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line-to-wait. which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option. that's 2008ish issues. as of this post, its still iffy, believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation. collectors edition-skin/items are all character bound. no way to move them, no way to given them to an alt. with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join, good luck. your pack just got wasted. am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason. also the lumena in-game currency was character bound, they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more. problem here is, they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt...see a trend? in game they warn you its non-refundable! yeah right, people got their money back. nice try.servers- they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time. am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen. so while opening new ones are nice, it splits up pre-made guilds and your precious already burned founders items. poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here. planning of only 1 server vs oceanic, south america, north america, carribean...get the point?roadmap- they have a vague one laid out. most of it is the same from the 3 other regions. but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time. therefore many of earlier region content was striped away. here's the thing, when you meet a person and give that first handshake, that first introduction, it says alot about who you are. neowiz...who are you becoming? neowiz-overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work. do you know what they did differently? open forums, discussions, podcasts, whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with...transparency. warframe and ff14 are to name a few here. you have been hearing feedback, yes, but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you. come out of that closet, face us more often and get that feedback and just talk...talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship. also, lets say your afraid, you dont want to face an audience, then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with.in short, i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you (neowiz) make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention. at that point, what happens to you?should you prove to turn this around and do better, then ill update my review. just no until then, moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a non-refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried.original post may 30th.edit and follow up 6/6hmmm where to start. i still would'nt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone. make your own informed decision for what $30-$150 is worth to you. soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the game's release. from there a few patches, that as i mentioned above, catered to whomever yells the loudest. some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf. not to mention that each patch note doesnt include full disclosure still. for example, first two dungeons used to drop gear, guaranteed, each boss. now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have rng of a drop rate for rng of it beign of your class. events! boy are they throwing events left and right. the last gather/crafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or alt-bank. content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible. i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised. dx11 was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it. further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above. dupe items scandal. it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed. it demonstrates a rolled back build, further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content. not a full rework. ff14 went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell. as for those involved in the duping, few days ban and items were kept. so they say. apparently they are listening to feeback through their discord and with some emissaries. i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways. performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within 2 weeks. perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions. performance, performance, ~60 million later, perfomance...they already stole your money (and mine) with lack of transparency. whats a few please wait, more soon to make you more gullible?sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience (twitter, reddit). the fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could 1-shot things. now that adjustments make sense, no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo/links system works. its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down, read, practice. but they seem addicted to preference already.latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition. they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound. this on its own is unnecessary to founders. gold is account bound and am willing to bet that's an issue on the code, unintended. yet the in-game dollar-currency, lumina is not.",0

6892,"honestly i have no idea how many hours i've logged in this game, but i truly cannot tell you if it's a good game. i've played since the beta using the bethesda.net launcher, but with each update i would be locked out of this game for some time despite all efforts (including uninstalling and reinstalling the software). now that my personal background with this game is out of the way, let me tell you about the elder scrolls: legends. it's a card game (duh) featuring characters and monsters from across the elder scrolls series. rememeber the adorng fan from oblivion? he's in this game along with cicero and miraak from skyrim. the adoring fan is just as annoying as he was in oblivion so don't worry! see, he has special card attributes (known as keywords in es:l) that make him a priority target. you have to kill the adoring fan before attacking anything else. in addition to this, he has another keyword that triggers when he is destroyed (called a last gasp) and his particular last gasp sends him right back into your deck to be played once you draw him again if you're lucky. just like most card games, there is a hefty amount of luck involved. the rune system, combined with this ingrained luck, drives me insane. runes work like this; both players have 30 health, and when a player's health is reduced by 5 points a rune is broken, allowing the player who is being attacked to draw a card. in addition to this, there are cards with the keyword prophecy, meaning that if they are pulled from a broken rune, they can be played immediately without any magic cost. i'm not sure if i love this mechanic or hate it. i love it, because if you are being demolished you could turn a match around with a lucky pull. i hate it, because if you are the attacking player you can wind up being punished for doing well. in conclusion i love this game because i love the elder scrolls universe (i'm a lore freak), i love card games, and sometimes the rune mechanic works in my favor. also, the deck building options are immense. i don't love this game when the rune mechanic doesn't work in my favor because i am a salty , and that's about it. tl;dr: it's a fun and free card game with beautiful artwork, great deck building possibilites, and a good story (set during the great war before skyrim). however, the rune mechanic can punish you for doing well in a match. ps: if i could have one thing added to the game it would be flavor text. just a sentence or two on each card, something for a player to read in between matches.",1

(i'll talk about that more later)custom huds are no longer usable.the matchmaking takes 30 minutes or more (hooboy, i'm gonna rant about this)teleporters are less expensivethey nerfed the pyro. hard. (dps is terrible. he's barely a threat anymore. not even the phlog can save him)now. let me tell you in detail how much of a dumb idea it is to make you wait if you leave mid game in casual. 1.) it's casual. 2.) it's casual. 3.) it's goddamn casual. 4.) what if something happens to your internet? what if something abrupt and unexpected forces you to leave?matchmaking. the reason smurfing in cs:go isn't as bad as it could be is because of one thing. the price tag. every single time you want to make a smurf account, you have to pay for another copy of the game. but with tf2, it's free. so all you need to do to make a smurf account is to make another account, download the game, and buy the cheapest thing off of the mann co. store. plus, the whole skill based matchmaking is a terrible concept. you could have played this game for over 5000 hours, and still be meh. you could then go into the game, and be matched with people who have played similar hours, but these people are amazing at the game. oh, but to play competitive, you have to buy a ticket no, you actually don't. all you have to do is link your phone number to steam, and you're ready to go.i started playing shortly before the mannconomy update, and it breaks my heart to not recommend tf2. most of my friends on steam are from tf2. hell, one of my best friends that i'm seriously considering travelling overseas just to stay with for a few months, was met on tf2. but now that valve is trying to compete with overwatch, even though if they stayed the same, overwatch would have died anyways, i have to click the thumbs down. goodbye, team fortress 2. i loved you. i loved seeing you grow. but i have to let go.",0

9802,"much more pay to win than its predecessor grand chase. i don't have many hours into this game, but i had something like 1000 into grand chase, not counting the probably over 2000 i played off of steam. this game is very similar in most ways but with a sharp difference, pay to win. you have to buy cash (can't remember if its cash or k-ching) to get most of the good items. pvp has a salt level of over 9000, but i always found this entertaining rather than a drawback. honestly, i wish they would have kept up grand chase and taken down elsword, albiet its a newer game. anyways, if you don't mind pouring money into the game, then sure it can be fun. but if you are looking for something you can enjoy without spending a whole bunch then i would not reccomend this game.moral of the story, if you came from grand chase i believe you will be very disappointed in what you find here.",0

4109,"i know a lot of people don't like these types of games that show up because mobile games belong on mobile, however i would like to try to convince you guys that this one is an exception. i played several months of the mobile version of this game and hope to at least make those of you on the fence curious enough to give it a shot. yu-gi-oh! is a pretty reknown franchise that struck most of us as kids, some younger some older. for me, i was about 10 years old, getting ready for a cheerleading performance (i do not miss being a cheerleader -_-), and i had enough time to watch the premiere episode of yu-gi-oh! on tv. i've enjoyed the series and games ever since, although some of the more complicated types of cards disappoint me slightly *coughpendelumscough*.yu-gi-oh! duel links is effectively taking the mobile games generations and bam! and combining certain attributes to get a surprisingly entertaining hit from konami for the first time in a while (outside of console games). effectively cutting the base yu-gi-oh! game in half, by limiting the field of 5 monsters and spell/trap zones to 3, deck sizes from 40-60 to 20-30 and everyone starts with 1 less cards, save that you start second as per the new rulings. beyond that and a limitation of certain cards that made the original game a fixed meta, and you have a surprising hit with some special cameos from well known characters that plays out as the original would otherwise.play as your favorite characters as you want. i was sold by my ability to play as and start as seto kaiba himself. some may prefer yami yugi, or mako, or mai or joey, or hell even friggen bandit keith. (in america!). and with the recent release of the ever so popular yu-gi-oh! gx series characters, cards and map, you have more options to play, and for the most part, next to no limitations in which cards you want to use for which characters.now to the imporant questions like, what about ban lists? yes, konami is in the process of adding a ban list for certain cards, now that there's a large pool for players to work with. however, it was literally patched in a few weeks ago and may take time for them to adjust to the current meta. what about *insert archtype*? - they get added in usually when a character known to use said archtype appears in the game. most recently they had jesse anderson running around with obtainable crystal beast cards. your favorite archtype is likely already there, if not, on the way.is there a strong deck type right now? - yep, the common ones i see a lot are blue-eyes white dragon decks using seto kaiba, warrior decks using joey wheeler, fire kings uses by whoever you think would utilize them the most. i personally have been using chazz prinston's ojama deck, recently with flying success, followed by using yugi moto for geminis.are there any major problems with the game that existed before the port? - sadly, yes. thankfully it's the only known problem to mention, and you guessed it. spam bots in the chat. konami recently updated their tos that made me think that they might be considering a stronger action against these illegal spam bot promoters, but i've yet to see any action yet. however, removing bots from a game or any other platform can be an uphill battle, especially if they've been there for a while.are there any issues with the steam version of this game? - no bugs that i know of. konami seems to be frequently keeping an eye on the game's status and bugs and is active to update and fix them. i personally wish they would allow for me to fix the screen resolution. i'm currently using a 1366x768 resolution, but the game screen is slighly larger then that with no option to resize or anything.i was playing on the mobile version prior as well, but i don't wan to start a new game. can i sync my data? - yep, just click data transfer on the start screen, and make sure you have a konami account from the website that the game redirects you to. i've already synced mine and it works really well.is it pay-to-win? depends on how you see it. the game uses a premium currency of gems as a means to buy cards. however said gems can be earned pretty reliably by just playing the game. paying for things like duel orbs isn't even necessary in my opinion, or extra decks slots. the card packages that can be bought for real money however, is up for debate, because while they offer the same cards you would get for playing the game normally, they can be obtained faster by buying them, and there's certain package deals that reward you gems and sometimes an sr card certainty for buying them. i personally don't think it is pay-to-win because you can earn all the same cards that everyone else can, some effort and time required for event-only cards. not everyone feels the way i do though, and it's understandable.if you guys have any other questions and concerns regarding the game, feel free to ask, and please be sure to give this game a fair shot, it's worth the time. promise :3",1
5442,"personally i do not understand all of the downvotes! i think some people missunderstand the purpose of this game on steam! this game is made by the same company for mobile devices (90%+ of the playerbase is on mobile, they are not looking to move to pc just give that optiion to players), as people like myself, often do not have time to play games that require a lot of time and commitment at home and that i only have time during travel. however when i am at home i would prefer to play on my pc. firstly i would say don't get this game if you want the pc version as your main world of tanks game, although wotb is an incredibly fun game which i give my full recommendation for if you can get around the fact that it is a mobile game. hope this clears up some things.thanks for reading",1

7004,"overall pretty good game for a card game, similar to hearthstone but based off the elder scrolls world. so if you know that world better than wow, this might be the game for you. the pve side of it is pretty good as well, provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you dont want to, thanks to the pve arena.biggest downfall which i very dislike, you cant create the cards that are in special bundles. so of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game. the reason i want to highlight this out is because they have a description for the madhouse bundle stating: we've added some cards thatll really help balance out certain decks and help the game. but you have to pay $10 just to get a bundle of cards.regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help maintane a competive advantage with exclusive/op cards, the games fun in its simple form. also im sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said op cards. i give the game total a 6/10 due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap. (cuz revenue is always better than player experience, we all know how the business world works). if your ok with spending money on digital cards, the game deserves 8/10 for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games.this last paragraph is edited: as necrophagist pointed out, u can use your ingame gold to purchase said content above. which is a good alternative, it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content. so i've decided to change the total rating to 7/10 due to that alternative.",1

2025,"summary: this game is, imo, the best of its kind.---the latest free mini-expansion for path of exile releases later today so it seems like a good time for me to recommend it. on the face of it this game is your standard diablo-clone - but even though it's not as flashy as diablo 3, its depth, customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition. the combat is fun and challenging. the game has a slow start (though that's one of the issues being addressed in today's expansion) but once the combination of skills and variety of environments becomes apparent it really comes into its own.the skill tree is huge (really, absolutely massive) and offers countless build customisation options, which is in complete contrast to (e.g.) diablo 3. you can combine skill gems to give your skills different effects -- sort of like runes in d3, but much deeper. i enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other games in the genre too because of the possibility of crafting and improving any 'trash' item that drops.the replayability is fantastic. new 'challenge leagues' are launched every few months which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting ways. they also usually adjust the balance of the game (it can be a bit flavour-of-the-month-ish) regularly which means that different builds are enticing, and since builds play very differently this also helps replayability. then there's 'races' - short and challenging events of between 12 mins and three hours which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non-pvp setting. race seasons run for six weeks or so every few months, with several events per day and unique rewards.poe is free-to-play but never pay-to-win. it has one of the best business models of any f2p game. microtransactions are cosmetic or functional (e.g. visual skill effects, stash tabs) and the base offering is among the most generous i've seen in a f2p game. poe's devs are responsive and down-to-earth, and regularly interact with players on reddit and the forums. give them your money!there are also plenty of little things - e.g. the game's take on health/mana flasks - which are so obviously better than the implementation in other games in the genre that it's very hard to go back to the impoverished versions of those features in other games.there are still things that need improving - the trade system needs work, for instance, and desync can be a problem in certain circumstances. but these are only small negatives compared to the positives.",1

16354,"don't bother. developer is a nutless piece ofthat obviously doesn't know how to run a db. the game's back-end is a complete mess. expect to have your recent activity wiped at any time because of server issues (this has happened several times in the last few weeks) and then be completely ignored while asking for help in the forum (unless maybe you've actually made use of the microtransactions or dlc? i guess free players don't ever translate into paying players?). you can also expect to have your account deleted in it's entirety if you are inactive for 6 months, which in my opinion is only proof of the cluster they call a back-end.personally i lost in excess of 10,000xp i was saving to unlock the next gun, when their servers crapped it a few weeks ago. despite their forum post explaining and asking people who have lost progress to reply, several weeks have passed while i personally have been completely ignored. and i have screenshots! they seem unable or unwilling to trace my account activity to verify my claim and re-instate my lost earnings (that cannot be earned again because in-game achivements are still registered as complete). their preferred method of explaining that they can't or won't help is to literally just completely ignore me.the game itself is fine. it's functional and does exactly what it says on the tin, but the database is strung together with spiderwebs and old coathangers. there's not much more to say about the game itself - it's fine. it has few bugs. it works. it's exactly what you'd expect and no more. in-game progress can be frustrating as the entire web of possible guns is not shown, with only the next 2 guns in any particular branch having visible icons and only the immediate next actually being named. if you want to unlock a specific or favourite gun, good luck trying to find out how to get to it!english is not the first language of the developer, which is obvious from reading the forum posts from them. that in itself is fine as they do an adequate job of communicating (when they decide your comments or questions are worth responding to at all - despite their claims of how active they are in their community; re: not actually active at all), but anyone who has been gaming for long enough should know that russian devs areat what they do. this trend continues here. also, thanks to one of the in-game achievments, do not be surprised if you have randoms requesting steam friend accepts just for the achievment. you can also expect to see cheaters on the high scores board every day, plus the high scores are broken, almost always with your faster time being displayed and ranked below someone with a slower time.if all this sounds like fun to you, then have at it! this player, however, has had enough.",0

13022,"at the time of this review i haven't put much time into the steam release of this game. i've played it a lot on my phone, & from the pc bethesda launcher, and windows 10 store. this game is really good. it starts off slow but gets better the more you play it. it's a much better game than i thought it would be from looking at the trailer & gameplay footage. it has optional micro-transactions but isn't pay to win. over all the versions of this game, i've never put any money in and i have more than enough caps, dwellers, nuka cola bottles and so on. i'm stockpiling resources on every version because the game without putting money in gives you more than enough of each. the game has a lot more depth than i originally though it would, and now you can also leave the vault and go on quests. i highly recommend giving this game a serious try, and putting some time in with it. if you're a fan of the fallout games, you'll understand things a bit more, but i can image even a non fallout gamer enjoying this game. in my opinion this game works really well with a controller, but is far better with keyboard and mouse. it's free, so check it out.",1

11103,"after playing both magic the gathering and hearthstone, i have to say eternal card game (ecg) game is a great blend of the two.although i loved mtg for its in-depth strategy, fun limited drafting style and the game mechanics, the reality is that the game is expensive and takes a lot of time to enjoy. hearthstone landed on the other end of the spectrum: it was cheap, easy to play but lacked the depth that mtg had.eternal card game has blended the two very well and is a fantastic edition to the space. the free to play mechanic is awesome; it is easy to amass a large number of cards that you can then use to build a competetive deck while enjoying the game without feeling like you are grinding. the ai is good albeit easy to beat if you undersatnd how it makes decisions.also, competeive multiplayer drafting is really well done in ecg and requies the amount of thought/skill of a mtg draft.for players who are not used to in-depth, mechanic and strategy heavy ccg, this game does have a much steeper learning curve than a game like hearthstone. however, the pay off is very rewarding.",1
2879,"look, i'll admit i play more than my fair share, and will continue to play. i don't drop on real world cash on the game, and for good reason. gaijin's entire monetary gain is based on your own frustration and bottlenecking you to put money down. you can play, sure, without spending any money, that's what i do, but the amount of time and effort you're going to expend: it's going to be at least 2x that of a premium player, and god forbid you want to try any vehicle that is premium based. entire sections of the game (such as italian tanks, most lend-lease/captured vehicles, certain camouflages, etc) are totally locked from players unless they drop real world cash on it or spends insane amounts of time on wagers which are extremely unreliable in themselves.unlike most other games that these days encourage more sportsmanlike fighting, gaijin is the exact opposite: punishing victims of teamkillers and rammers, encouraging spawn camping (both ways) and moreover empowering wallet warriors. from throwing coupons at you, to pointing out every game here's what you would get if you were premium, to parts/fps/re-crewing grinding, and more... gaijen has largely by far created a game that doesn't extract money by tricking you into lootboxes, or loud showy sounds or other psychological trick: it's often pay with your wallet or patience.i won't tell you to not play it, because it can be fun, i find it fun, i really do: but frankly, if you want a dev that actually cares about player feedback, don't play this game. if you want a game that is fully free to play, don't play this game. i could go on but... this became a dead horse beating.the fact of the matter is:for the love of god don't give gaijin your money. they do not need any more encouragement. they really don't. seriously. it's to such a point that you can find statements from gaijjn employees that basically conflate player frustration / grind with profits. and if you're rich and you think this game is for you: don't be fooled. even for the whales, you'll feel the sting of things because notice how i haven't said, it's pay to win. because it's not: moreover, it's pay to avoid spending excess time. you can buy the most expensive things in the game, you could buy every last bit of content in the game with real world cash, and ultimately, it won't give you any increase in skill or anything. you'll still find yourself sucker punched in spawn by a guided rocket, you'll still find yourself being dove on by a chalka, you'll still get that single bullet hitting you that splits your aircraft in two.so just... play it, don't play it... just don't give gaijin more of your cash until they stop abusing the player base.because really, for those who actually shell out cash to this game, it's always an abusive cycle of...legitimate complaints -> introduce shiny new vehicles -> add more microtransactions -> legitimate complaints.it's an abusive cycle, and frankly: it's only going to sour gaijin and the player base more as it repeats.",0
12900,"i get why people don't like it for the most part. it really is a mobile game because of the waiting and it isn't a click-fest so people aren't enjoying it because instead of watching resources build infinitely while they click like monkeys having seizures located primarily in their fingers, it's a slower-paced game where resources build over time. i see people whining about having their money stolen, although that would mean the game is taking money from them without their permission which is just a lie. you don't get anything stolen, you choose to pay for items in a f2p game on steam. i'm not sure why these people are lashing out at someone else for something they clearly chose to do, but in either case it's just a lie. i don't care if purchases don't carry over to a new vault (how many do you need, did you screw up that badly, that many times?) especially for a game that doesn't need *any* item to actually be bought in the first place. you wanna toss a tip to the devs and buy a box or pet or bot? ok, it's your money to toss. but don't buy something then turn around and scream they stole your money. it's pathetic.graphics are fine, it's a pretty fun game to play while drinking a cup of coffee and reading something or watching a video on the side. sing & fantastic beasts just came out, i'd suggest either of those i think they were very good.good game, good resource management means you need to do some actual thinking, or you could buy something to make it a little easier. or you could do the daily quest things and get caps & boxes for free like most people.",1

7044,"pros- very fair f2p/p2w model. the intructory story/tutorial is alright, just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda, but the game deserves praise for giving you access to a generous number of 50 cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start (or at least, after finishing the tutorial). you can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of skyrim expansion with in-game currency, in less than 30 hours of gameplay i was able to buy two of these decks for 1000 coins, which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorial/story. -great art, tes designs at their best. each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at, and they all come with accompanying sound effects and/or voice over. - the game's rng is one hell of an important factor in winning games. there's a big overlap between what a common card can do when rng favors it and what a legendary card can do when rng is not in its favor. what this means is that you absolutely do not need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it. good cards give you an edge, but good deck synergy and rng still reign supreme.-great card/deck identity. the game really benefit from the tes theme, each card and deck built around it oozes personality, and each combination of different races (or lack of) yields a solid, recognizable theme, different from all others. recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game. this ties into the game's balance: learn to pace your decisions. every deck has a certain rhythm to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains. learn them to make the most of each deck. cons- way, way, way too many rng mechanics. yes, this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game, but you'll eventually be on the receiving end of the rng beating. numerous cards have effects such as summoning a random creature. no, not a random creature from your deck, any random creature from the entire game. you will get screwed over by a hail mary at some point, you need to learn to accept that. this also ties into the next con:- built in comeback mechanic. as you burn through your opponent's life points, you'll break a total of 5 runes. each time you break a rune, your oponent draws a card. if your opponents card is a prophecy card, they'll be able to play it immediately with no cost. this can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly, so most of the game's meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times. you are never entirely safe.overall, i recommend the game to all fans of tcg games. if you ever played a tcg game, you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition, and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it, and you don't have to pay a price of entry just to see if it's going to appeal to you.",1

9018,"starting off, if you do not have a decent computer, then this game probably is not the game for you.planetside 2 is a massive online multiplayer, strategic first-person shooter, where the goal is simple and the answer is anything but. the goal: capture more territory for your faction, which is one of three themed teams. territories are captured by captureing points in a king of the hill and ctf kind of way. each territory has between 1 and 3 points that are captured by being withing a ccertain distance of a point. after that, it can take up to 5 minutes for the territory to be completely captured. the only hard part is how you achive this goal and fend off players who are constantly running back from their spawn room or sunderrer (a truck) mobile spawnpoint. this is the hard part about this is the route that you take to do this. first off, there are 3 factions who each have their own benefits, art style, and specalizations. the vanu sovreignty (vs) are a spandex peoples who believe that technology is the most important thing when it concerns the evolution of society. their weapons boast little bullet drop, and quick reload speeds. they also have some aoe guns (exploding plasma shots).the new conglomerate (nc) are the liberators, fighting for freedom. they have low fire rates with hard hitting weapons combined with huge magazines. just be prepared for the rediculous reload times. also the nc are very fond of shotguns.the terran republic (tr) are fighting for something (justice i think???). they have high fire rates and are very fond of chainguns.personally i specialize in being a close range infiltrator (they have lower health but have sheilds). smgs while expensive, are excellent killing machines. the other classes are the light and heavy infantry, engineer, medic, and max. each class has it's specific guns, abilities, and uses. the difficult thing about planetside 2 is that positioning is vitally important. after about 250 hours i started getting the flow of the game. by 400 hours i was finally starting to mantain a kd above 1. this game has a steep learning curve and will take a lot of getting used to. however, i see the 500+ hours completely worth it and can't wait till summer so i can play this a lot more.",1

3946,"woo boy, this is gonna be a fun review. tldr at the end.this is a good game. it really is. there's so much i want to say about it, so i'll get started.graphically, this game is amazing. not because it's hyper-realistic, but because the art-style is unique to a point where it's almost impossible for it to look aged. this game is ten years old and still looks great. gameplay-wise, it's fun. you run around, you shoot people on the opposite team. it's not always shooting bullets though. there are 9 classes, each with their own unique weapons. there are rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers. there are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well. even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use. the different classes are played in a variety of different ways, so there's probably a favorite class for everyone. and then there's character design. i could probably gush about this for hours, but i won't. each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette. they are all very unique, to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears. then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme. the scout's main weapons are all scatterguns, the heavy's main weapons are all miniguns, etc. these characters not only have unique designs, but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too. just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities. it's so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality, and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free. the characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous, but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable. there is probably something to be said about diversity here, especially because of its competitor, overwatch. there's no dancing around it; this game is simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as overwatch is. however, the characters presented in this game have far more personality than the characters presented in overwatch. i have played overwatch before, and unlike this game, was not enthralled by the characters. with this game, i was almost immediately drawn in because of the characters themselves, not just the gameplay. sadly, however, women designs were once upon a time made for this game, but for whatever reason were scrapped. they were very unique designs too, and if the team actually had followed through on making them and had applied the same effort they did for their male characters, they would have made some of the best dang female characters in gaming.i'm gonna apologize about the overwatch comparison, but i'm still salty about blizzard making half-baked female characters and then being touted as progressive when they're really just playing the middle to attract the most players. the tf2 character designers could make women characters that would crush overwatch in every way, if they ever decided to do that.there is also something to be said about the community. it sucks. big time. if you're a woman or have a high pitched voice, you're probably better off not using the voice chat, at least in casual mode. if you do, you'll probably get sexist comments hurled at you, or if they just think you've got a high pitched voice, called a squeaker and might even get kicked. a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist, sexist, homophobic, and every -ist and -phobic thing in the book into the chat. it's painful to read, but hey, it sure is fun getting dominations on homophobes and then taunting after killing them. so that's something you can do.of course, it isn't all bad. and most games of this nature end up with a community like that anyway, so it's no surprise really. there are a bunch of good folks out there too. i've met some good folks through this game, and if you play it for long enough, you will too. just don't be surprised about the bad folks. plus there's a bunch of different sub-communities that are usually full of nice people.tldr; it's a good game, and it's free to pick up and play so you've got nothing to lose but your time. it's fun, has a bad overall community but nice little sub-communities, unique and fun characters, and a lot of cool maps. play it and have fun.",1

2586,"two years ago i would have recommended this game. now i can't.i don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call war thunder a simulator), so i can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.but i can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.there are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.in order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. when you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. at the start of the game it isn't too bad. a low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. that's 9 games, fair enough.the problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. to get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the fw 190-d9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. that's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.that means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. want to get a jet? play 500 matches.the game doesn't reward you for playing well either. even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the mvp, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. it's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. on top of that, gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and i can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. they could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. this means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. so to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time i mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. rp gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since i started playing. this is also why i have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning i would have quit very quickly.this makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why i quit playing it.now the second issue - balance. this one is a lesser issue to me because i didn't play game for historical matchups.the game uses a system called battle rating to match different planes together in a battle. a plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. the problem is that the battle rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.you will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.keep in mind that world war 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.the result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.if i feel like seal clubbing i can just take out my he 112-a0, f2a buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course i'd get next to no reward for this, but i sure would make a lot of people frustrated).in the case of the he 112-a0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.on the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in realistic battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.so why do these matchups exist? that you can ask only gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in war thunder.this brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.any of the above will likely never be fixed. the developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. they don't read the english forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.the way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. the post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. there are many more problems with the game that i haven't mentioned because i haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).i'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.everything works perfectly well in gaijin-land, comrade! (except it doesn't).tl;dr:if you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. it is free after all. but it's a waste of your time.",0

4676,"there is no such thing as a simple review for a game which is so vast in its complexities. but in short, the game is amazing. the playerbase ranges from super friendly to little mortons salt girls and the three trolls under the bridge and everything in between. some players understand too much of the game and get bent if you don't select the character they want you to select and or buy the items they want you to select, and others just give great tips and don't mind carrying you a few games to show you the ropes. i definitely recommend watching some videos on how to play before you just jump in though as i mentioned the game is pretty complex. if you show up to a team game and you obviously didn't listen to the tutorials people will get frustrated. the problem is that unlike other pvp games you dying repeatedly because you attack like leeroy jenkins during a raid makes your enemies stronger which causes your team to die also... pay attention to the tutorials and ask a friend about what to buy for your chosen god... you really want to set it up before you go in to multiplayer matchmaking. those valuable seconds you spend searching during multiplayer will get your team killed. i definitely recommend this game, but don't waste all your money buying skins... if you are able to resist!",1

2960,"absolutely not worth your time, i promise you. the game is made so that you will be outgunned 9/10 games and you roam from match to match losing all your tanks immediately.the shell hasnt done any damage voice line will be burned into your ing brain.from my experience i feel as if the game is purposefully gimping you (with the already dice rolls, this game heavily relies on luck).the game is based around a br system x.0 x.3 x.7 (1.0 1.3 1.7) and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down 1 point of br which is ing broken most of the time. i'd like to see tanks around my level or one above/below mine. instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are 1 whole br above you, meaning your best tank is worthless. if your best tank is worthless, all the ones below it are useless. the second i researched a tank past 3.0 (3.7) i immediately saw an insane rise in my br (battle rating) versus everyone else. once in a blue moon i can penetrate the tanks i find, otherwise i am either getting ed by enemy armor or my own team not defending a point. i went from getting 5-10 kills a match to getting maybe 1 or 2. sometimes 0.this is not a matter of skill because i can outflank the enemy team like a ing mythical norse god and still be useless because i put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank, while this guys brigade of super heavy 4.7 tanks turn around andall over me. i cant count the number of times i've seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map, mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through 40 ing trees.arcade is ing useless, it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by 500. if there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank, you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game. the second your name pops up 15 tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn heat shell with the accuracy gungnir. if you even attempt realistic without 3000 hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier. if you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every ing aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you, robbing you any chance of having fun.so they almost have a good game here. but they wont fix the dice rolling, they wont fix thematchmaking range, they wont fixto make a good game. i dont mind the grind at all (which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers). they wont because it heavily insentivizes people to get premium and buy their way through the grind, in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their 105mm wand. it is such an incredibly fustrating and unrewarding experience once they've roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that 1/10 game is not worth it. i rarely got matched with high br until i really got into the game. dont even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single ing stray bullet.i would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging they've got going on.edit: tanks (and aircraft) are also seperated in ranks. these ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about 1.7-2.7 in br; although the ranges vary based on the nations you play. my point being is 100% of the tanks in france rank 1 are unplayable and i am not exaggerating in the slightest. to compare, the worst i did with a tank in rank 1 (germany/usa) in war thunder was something like 12 spawns and 17 kills. i never had more deaths than kills in war thunder until i tried the french. the french are so bad i had a tank with 17 spawns and 2 kills. another tank with 17 spawns and 5 kills. one tank with 11 spawns and 1 kill. the only time i could get kills was pure and absolute luck with finishing off someone elses target while i hit weak spots in the back, which sometimes took many shells. or shooting a notoriously terribly armored tank (bt-5). it was baffling how these tanks were incapable of penetrating even the worst of tanks. non of the starting tanks would yield their sweet death to me, including the japanese. even when i managed to penetrate, the amount of time it took me to lob 5-8 shells into a single tank, only gave teamates enough time to finish them off just because you couldnt finish off their crew. i'm sure if you google french rank 1 tanks you will see everyone agrees.",0

14333,"i've been playing this game on another platform in case anyone is wondering why i only have so few hours played.this is just my opinion on the game, the devs, and the situation based on my perspective as a player:after months of unsatisfaction and hope that things would get better, i have to warn people that this game is pretty much a scam.the game hasn't received a proper update in over a year. important bugs and ui issues still haven't been fixed, problems that make the game tedious, frustrating and boring haven't been addressed, no new features were added to make things interesting...meanwhile the devs did two things:1) they promised content, fixes, updates, etc.2) every month, they released 3 packages at $15 a piece that were way overpriced for what they did (even $5 would be expensive, imo).people have been buying these time-limited packs because they thought improvements were coming soon. instead, the devs just made empty promises. they made polls on the forums to pretend that they wanted feedback, they published lists of stuff they were supposedly working on, they made excuses every week for unexplained delays, they blamed most of the situation on the community manager and replaced her by someone who just apologized more for delays... in other words, they did everything they could to save their reputation despite not actually doing anyting good for the game.a few weeks ago they also started to lock critical topics on the forum and they deleted old topics where they promised more content. it's kind of funny, i thought this would happen so i kept screenshots of these things... i guess i have enough experience with dishonest developers and their money-grabbing tactics to see these things coming.the worst they did is that they even banned one of their loudest critics and top players from the whole game for racism, for jokingly referring to the chinese company owners as our chinese overlords. as if it wasn't bad enough, from what i've been able to understand that comment was made in a private discord channel. the forums mysteriously became much less critical after that, everyone obviously started to worry about their game account getting banned for made-up reasons. long-time contributors to the community, who had special status on the forum acknowledging their efforts, also mysteriously lost that status after criticizing the game and became less vocal about their complaints.well, recently the devs anounced that they hadn't been working on any of the things they promised. instead, they had spent all their time making the game available in china. they said the promised fixes, improvements and additional content would come later, and they released 3 more packs at $15 a piece anyway.the thing is, i don't think any fixes, improvements or content are coming. they pretty much lied for months about working on this when it's now clear they weren't, so i think they don't plan to work on it at all, they're probably just trying to sell as many packs as possible until the game stops making enough money.so my advice: don't spend any money on this game. it's overpriced, the devs are lying about working on content, they censor criticism, and they try to hide the old promises they made. the content you can buy is overpriced, it will take you a very long time to use it due to broken game mechanics, and it's very unlikely that things will ever get better.it's one thing when devs make plans for new content, but then unexepected stuff happens and they can't finish the work. it happens. but in the case of shop heroes, it seems they never had any serious plans to begin with, despite saying otherwise. and that's not acceptable at all.you've been warned.",0
10574,"i started playing eternal almost three years ago, and have played consistently since then. i haven't played modo since i picked it up, and i tried arena but find it lacking in critical ways. i've tried out hearthstone, gwent, and artifact, but none of them have really taken my interest. i love that i can pick up and play 1-5 games a day, or if i want to play some events i can play for hours. the game economy is friendly and sensible, decks are interesting. i can play draft, sealed, or constructed. the ai mode is fun for days when i just want to mess around with basically zero thinking, or if i'm on a bad connection or know i'll be interrupted. the dev team is responsive to community requests, and keeps a close eye on comments (reddit/discord/twitch), in-game feedback, and the constant pile of stats they gather on all aspects of the game. i haven't felt the game get stale, which is amazing for the length of time i've been playing. it's easy to play for free, i recommend picking it up to try it out for a bit. check in on reddit and discord to get some pointers, the community focus is one of the best parts of the game. there's also some very approachable twitch streamers, you can get a good feel for things by watching any of the more popular ones for a few minutes. twitch chat is amazingly non-toxic, you can ask questions and get useful answers to just about anything.",1
2155,"pretty standard game of that genre.you can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. what i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. you have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.the (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. but pricings of around 40 bucks for an armour set, around 10 bucks for headgears or currently up to 80 bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.all in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. it simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while.

14111,im ready to be downvoted into oblivion for what i have to say but i really have enjoyed this game so far. i understand better than anyone the warz community has been spit on and dragged through the mud to many times. everyone is so ready to just highlight the negative aspects of the game but im willing to admit there are some good features. im a 4 year warz veteran who has played all the knock off of this game so let me say this is so much more than just another remake. alot of people are talking about pay to win if they spent more than a hour on the game they would see the abundance of loot and how easily shop currency is aquired just through playing. i feel like its balanced when really the only thing you cant get through looting is simply weapon skins.pvp-i expected to see a onslaught of cheaters with the thousands of new players but even with the dozens i have fought today i have yet to encounter anyone even suspicous. the pvp is fun and plentiful i really missed the feeling of killing a group of people and seeing them each pop like pinatas. the rush i get from grabbing the loot is something i could never get from another game.for any old warz players or new people reading this for the time being i strongly recomend giving this game a chance despite what others say.,1

14949,"i genuinely used to love this game when it was first brought out. it was fun, innovative and hilarious to see some of the creations players came up with. it was a good mix of builder as well as fps. i don't know what they were thinking when they made the more recent changes but the game has definitely lost a lot of what made it fun.one of the aspects they removed which i particularly liked was the way their premium worked. it used to be that anyone in your battle who had premium would increase everyone's reward by 5%; this was very, very sadly removed. this made buying premium feel like it was worth it as everyone benefited from it, but now premium users only receive more junk in their crates, which is more often than not just as useless.the new loot crate system they have in place feels a lot like its starving players. as an established player i can't imagine how anyone new to this game will be able to make anything capable of standing up to other established players. barely anything of use is rewarded meaning you have to spend a lot more time in game to be able to even earn simple upgrades for your bot. salvaging is a painful waste as well as you receive so little currency in return for anything you might not need, and even then you're scrimping through your supplies to find something you can spare to salvage. everything is stupidly expensive from this perspective as you make so little from salvaging that even purchasing building blocks is painful. you really do need to rely on whatever rewards you earn making it difficult and very time consuming. you can purchase the best crates from the store but this is a money drain as they too aren't guaranteed to give you anything of use.the weapons feel highly unbalanced as anything with high power has a very high cost of energy, often leaving you defenceless. there isn't a tech tree anymore either, so (in my opinion) levelling feels very tedious. i have no desire to level as it feels like i'm not being rewarded and often just feels like work. you don't often earn much in the way of experience from the battle modes, making the most effective means of levelling the solo player mode which strips it of its multiplayer aspect. you can earn a bit more experience from the arena modes, however, due to the weapons, these too feel very unbalanced. more often than not you are up against established players with much better weapons and the more elite items available, e.g. the power shields, so beginner players often don't stand a chance.the megabots were one of the best parts of the game and they too were removed. they offered a direction for battle which was good aspect as it felt like there was a leader. having someone to follow and support more often helped the game's direction. their components however remain in game but at stupidly high costs for both in game currency and pflop requirements which makes them almost pointless, as you often can't afford to equip them even if you could afford to purchase them. so established players also hold this over beginning players as they have these mega weapons and beginning players are less likely to ever get them.from the outside it seems a lot like the developers are trying to cater to the more negative comments from players and the robocraft community. it's been stripped, twisted and turned into something that feels almost like an entirely different game to how it was. it's a shame to see what it's become, as it really did start off going from strength to strength only to hit this very disappointing low.summary- paid premium is almost useless and only gives premium users an extra chance at useless junk in their loot crates.- loot crates offer very little of anything useful and purchasing premium crates doesn't guarantee useful equipment which is starving new players. it's near impossible to build or upgrade bots unless you put in very large amounts of time.- salvaging for currency is a joke; salvaging only returns a very minimal amount of currency making it nearly impossible to purchase items. this along with the very random, often useless returns from the loot crate means nothing you receive is worth salvaging, and if it is, is too badly needed to afford being salvaged.- megabots were removed, but their components are still in game but aren't cost or pflop efficient. this took out a big, fun part of the feel of robocraft.",0

16838,"product received for freeearly access review fantastic cooking fungameplayyou are dropped into a random part of the map after a loading screen of clouds, first thing you will notice is the game is actually really decent looking, with odd running animations, the game already has parkour and many guns,and pots and pans to cover your a$$. opening doors is very loud which is good and bad, it might be louder just on your own client. the game only has 30 people in it for the moment which seems to be great for the map size. the map is fantastic and looks alot like france/germany in ww2. which is not surprising as this is a ww2 mod. the guns shot well but could do with some improvements. the end game is scary as hell, wierd noises that sound like you're mothers bedroom on a sunday night. the starting screen leaves alot to be disered but its still early days. the best thing about the game i would say is it has its own spin on it. and no boring building! tl:dri would give it a solid 7/10. needs more work and all that but its great fun.",1

8723,"as of this exact point in time, i can't recommend this game at all. my friend and i play late night/early morning, and as expected - there's not as many players on during these times. this typically translates into longer queues, which i can accept. it comes with the territory of playing so late. however, the most recent update addressed queue times by adding bots to the match. this is even included in ranked matches.these bots are beyond useless, and take all sense of fun or accomplishment out of the game. we went from never winning a match (which honestly, i don't expect to. we're not great.) to winning over 5 matches.the worst part is, the first time we won i wasn't aware they were bots. i was so excited to have a legitimate victory. that was hollowed after finding out the game was basically handed to us. if the bots were to be 100% removed, i could honestly recommend this game again. i personally find it more enjoyable than fortnite. i would much rather wait 5 minutes to get a competitive game against real players. if they want to add a bot mode, that's fine, but it shouldn't be added into ranked of all things...",0

15675,"note: this is a review on the steam version of the game and how i feel the game from a pc perspective and not a mobile perspective. there is no difference from the steam version and the mobile version but there are some things that look good on a phone or tablet but not so much on the pc. if this was a review on the mobile version then i would definitetly recommend this game.now as the game is still open beta, there are many things to be added and polished on (like levels, maps, shops etc) so i can't talk about the lack of content but instead i will mention the things that i feel are weird in the pc or things that should be added or modified.the ui - it shouldn't come to a suprise that when you make a cross platform game between pc and mobile, there are gonna have to be corners cut. in this case its the ui. on mobile, the ui looks great and makes sense but on the pc, it just looks cheap and unclean. preferably if possible, adding an option to switch between tablet ui and pc ui would be amazing. the ui also lacks alot of small yet needed details like specific hp, mp, and xp numbers.friends/party system - while there is an friends list system, there is no party system. you can use the summon code (which is a bit buggy at times. i was stuck in loading) to play on the same channel/map but there isn't a real party system. so you can't see their hp/mp bar without clicking on them. this may not be as big as a problem now but in the future when there are healer classes, it would be extremely difficult to play as you can't attack a monster while keeping tabs on your friends hp at the same time.weapons/classes/stats - there are 4 main stats in the game; hp, mp, attack, and defense. the class you have on only affect your skills and nothing else. daggers gives the most attack of all the weapons, staffs give the most mp, and swords give the most defense. here's the problem. all the classes are equally tanky. i have played all the classes besides guardian and i have noticed little to no difference in survivability. being tanky isn't going to help when you're playing a rogue or mage because that's not what they do, and warriors are suppose to be tanky, but do a bad job at it because there are no skills to help him be tanky. in fact, i would say mage and rogue are more tanky because they have defensive skills (mana sheild and stealth). this makes attack the most valuable stat for doing the most damage. aqw was really customizable because there was no restriction on what weapon you could use. you could be a mage and use a hammer, but this only worked because every weapons attack stats were the same and the attack stats are mainly determined by the enchant. in aq3d, each weapon has different stats. attack determines how much damage you do, and that's the only real stat you should be going for as rogue or mage. even warriors should build this over defense tbh. daggers have the highest attack making the daggers the only viable weapon to use for high dps. this takes away a lot of customization (plus it looks weird for a mage to use a dagger as a weapon). some solutions to this would be adding more stats (like luk for rogues and int for mages) or making it like aqw where all weapons have equal damage and the stat's are based off enchants.again, this game is still in beta so it is expected to be some flaws but there is a lot of potential in this game. with some things added and polished, i can see this being a very fun game",0

9488,"realm of the mad god is a medieval-themed rogue-like with 2d pixel graphics. there is no story or campaign, only some background lore. the object in the game is to wreck havoc and kill creatures on a huge island (the realm). these creatures are oryx's (the mad god) minions. killing them will earn exp and drop some occasional loot. killing tougher monsters (gods) willoryx off (hence the name: mad god). when angry, oryx will teleport the players on the island to his castle, where they will attempt to kill oryx. when succeeded, players will teleport to another realm, starting the chain again.the game is proper fun for the first couple of hours. after that the flaws will start to point out, including annoyingly repeatitive soundtrack. it is less than two minutes long 8-bit chant.-there are too few levels (only 20), and the highest level will be achieved in just a couple of hours, tops. each level-up will give you higher stats, determined by your class. even after reaching lvl 20, you can still get your stats higher by consuming stat potions. the stats will eventually max out, making the corresponding number turn gold/yellow.-the equippable items are quite interesting. there are four types of equippable items: weapon, class skill, armor and ring. there are five tiers of class skills and rings, and 10+ tiers of armors and weapons.-there are several different classes with different skills and stats for different playstyles, which makes the game much more interesting. at first most of the classes are locked, but they can be unlocked by playing and performing well with the earlier classes.the game is completely free, which means a strong pay-to-win aspect. there is a tremendous spike in difficulty after reaching certain areas. after traveling deep enough to the center of the island (or teleporting to hard dungeons), the game becomes somewhat unplayable. the monsters' health and damage are high enough to end your journey in a blink.do i recommend the game? it depends on the player's expectations. if one is looking for having, fun for free, for an hour or two, then yes. if one is looking for a long, enjoyable experience, this game can not provide it. please stay away.",0

844,"it's very rare that i am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game i don't like. wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game...i mean this game is bad and i mean really bad! the map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. oh let's not forget when i logged in for the very first time, i received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. i literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. i could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. an option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. my gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. i lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out i did not hit him once! so throughout the match i sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. and of all the ridiculous solutions i've found this has got to be the worst. i found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. the trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (i know i'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). you aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.and then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which i gotta say wow. people who hack in this game are way too comfortable in cheating. from what i've seen these hackers walk around like yeah i'm cheating...the f*** you gonna do about it?! in some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. but not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so i guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. shame on me for not noticing this sooner. i get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that not once during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. this game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. the problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. i can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (who knows you miles may vary)",0

11517,"a couple things i would like to address are the money aspect of the game. right now the game is not pay to win (as that can change in the future but hopefully we dont make that turn) they offer in-game currency to be able to obtain weapons with skins on them (no the skins dont make the stats any better than the normal gun) not to mention the in-game currency isnt extremely expensive and they give you a good amount for what you pay. now lets move on to the gameplay aspect, the game is perfect for anyone who likes fast paced type games. the game has imaculate hit reg so nothing to complain about in that region of gameplay. the one thing that they could change would be spray patters in my opinion. i have played alot of fps games and the recoil in those games are more easier to control, the recoil in this game seems like its just random at times and if we could get reliable recoil patters for the game that would make this game ten times better. other than that 10/10 best f2p shooter on steam. and another thing you can literally run this game on a potato!",1

10400,"great game. there are a few issues i have though. for instance, when walking the deer spoke way too easily!. i could be about 600-700 yards away and the deer would take off and thats with just me walking. also it would be great if you could add in some vehicles to get around more easily!. one of the worst things for me is the fact that running speed is only barely faster than walking speed. and getting around is hell. i find it so difficult to get to hunting stands or locations i wish to go, because of how slowly the player moves. maybe let us move faster or add some atv's or something to get around faster.i get this is supposed to be a realistic hunting game and thats fine but don't take all the fun out of it. its a game its not real life. fishing would be cool to see in this game, also i haven't had any problems with this game up until the latest update, my game always fails to initiate now, since the update.",1
4321,"this is, first and foremost, a mobile game ported to steam. is that a bad thing? maybe. the thing is that how much you spend is up to you, but if you want to get your favorite individual cards, you better hope they are rare or normal, and not put in the abritrary packs/rewards. while the game gives free currency to get packs frequently, it only happens with events that give it away in big lumps, else you're getting trickles of gems.second, the game plays like pre-5ds era yu-gi-oh, with a smaller field to make games faster. this is both a strength and weekness for the game, as while this brings in vets of the game, it can turn away more meta players/players who's favorite card/archtype is not in the game.third, this game is very competitive at times, and trys to subtlely nudge you into paying with the vegabond duelest, who are just ghosts of high ranked pvp players, who also duel with sometimes bs modifiers like having a full field or having only 2 cards in your hand. add those modifiers with a good deck and the odds are so stacked against you at times it's like an whale versus a mouse.sure, you can harp on me saying i only have <100 hrs on the game, but it's a game that discurages playing for long without paying. and while i don't mind having cards from post-gx, if you're gonna port an archtype, port an archtype that fits within classic/gx era, not archtypes that have good syncros/xyz/pendulum monsters.",0

16575,"product received for freenow, i love btd battles to death, don't get me wrong. i've played flash and mobile/win 10/steam (they play just the same) quite a bit. but there are a few things that really need to be fixed in this version that the devs know about (unless they live under a rock or something) but won't fix. let's get to pros and cons, shall we?pros:-replayability, for obvious reasons-good for all ages and skill levels with its family-friendliness and its battle arena system-many fun gamemodes-a very nice tower selection-solid graphics, most other td games tend to be too realistic or absolutely terrible looking, this game finds the sweet spot between them-decent matchmakingcons:-game balance-downloading vital data bug-need to pay to enjoy the game to its fullest (i'll overlook this myself due to my love for btd, but for others this can be a huge annoyance)the pros speak for themselves, so i'll talk about my cons.fist of all, the downloading vital data bug. this bug causes you to be completely unable to play the game due to the loading screen getting stuck at downloading vital data forever, and happens seemingly at random (and not to everybody), sometimes staying for days and other times requiring a simple close-and-reopen to fix. this has been around for a long, long time, and makes this game very difficult to play on pc for some people. i haven't heard of it happening on mobile.secondly, game balance. many will disagree with me here, but i just feel like some towers are absolutely ***ing useless and others are winning the best tower race by a few thousand miles. here's some examples:dart monkey - cheap, extremely good early and mid-game, requires zero support until round 22spike factory - slow, not that good at any point in the game compared to other towers, requires a lot of supportbanana farm - gives a massive head start on economy, can be sold to defend a rush, counterrush, or rush, usable on all but one map to its fullest extentbloonchipper - combos well with many other towers, can destroy entire ceramic bloon layers with just 2 upgrades and entire zomg layers with 4, and can almost infinitely stall any amount of bloons with a large enough amount of x-4 bloonchippers (just fix this already ***it, it's not hard)these are just 4 examples. there are many, many more.there are only really 4 mid-tier towers, which are the ninja monkey, monkey apprentice, sniper monkey and ice tower. they perform well, but need support from other towers, just not too much. they're examples of very well balanced towers. other towers are either quite a bit better or quite a bit worse, and it makes it so that higher levels of play boil down to one or two different strategies, with the rest being unable to keep up with the best of the best.paying for faster-regenerating battle energy (battle energy being a huge part of the game) and more battle energy is already showing a little bit of pay-to-win. you can still beat energy-buyers, don't get me wrong, it isn't like buying a $1 in-game money tower that has infinite zomg and bloon popping power. it's still a bit of an unfair advantage. there's also the fact that you can only enter 1 club room every 24 hours without the $6 pass, and the fact that you can fully upgrade a tower for $6, making it somewhat unfair to new players who get matched up with you because of your 5/2 win-loss record. i'm not saying this game is pay-to-win, but when you need to pay to get the full experience, it's not good.overall, i have to give this game a negative. if they put a little more thought into game balance and micro-transactions, i would definitely change my mind. heck, even just nerfing the dart monkey and supa-vac would make an absolutely massive difference. but as it stands, this game's downsides, despite there being few, make this game quite a chore at points.",0

10424,"i don't get why everyone is complaining about the fact that you have to pay to play most of the game, that's a normal thing these days. if you bother to pay (and you won't pay more than a normal game to get 3 months plus a good range of gear - and then it's really cheap to renew your licence whenever you miss the game), it's an amazing beautiful hunting game. it really is ultra real, and if you are opposed to hunting real animals but can see the fun otherwise, then this is the game for you.it's the only game where you will walk, and even crawl most of the time and enjoy it. it's a game that makes good finds rare, so when they come they are really rewarding, and challenging. there's a thrill in hunting an animal across the gorgeous (huge) maps and making sure you don't spook it.you also get to hunt with friends, which is a great pasttime. grab a beer, get a good microphone and head out into nature with your buddies and enjoy good, old fashioned, manly hunting!try it, it's free to try (thats the point), and you do get to go on a great map and hunt a deer that's as fun as all the other animals. you can even go on the other maps and find other animals, you just can't shoot them (but you can photograph them and see if you want to invest).ignore the spoiled brats that want everything free and give this game a go :)p.s. i've played for over 100 hours, via the website rather than steam ;)",1

9034,"edit ---i am editing my review as i have put another 110+ hours into the game since the original review was posted. i think i can explain the game additionally now seeing every side of the game.over those 110 hours i realized the game doesn't change mainly because of the community.the community, what's left from it is all veteran players that have been used to the system for so long. no changes will be made to the game as its community is slowly but surely dying. on peek times around 4000 players a day, not a good sign, to top that soe just announced merging of 2 us servers because of low population.as a new player: the game is extremely harsh for new players, not only are you put in a significant disadvantage from the start with crappy weapons, you are thrown into the game without a single idea of where, who or what you are doing or suppose to be doing, against all max ranked players that dedicated their lives to farming you.on top of that, anyone trying to get into the vehicleside 2 side of gameplay is pretty much sure to fail. as all players are on the same map at the same time, your stock vehicle will get melted in nanoseconds, your only choice is to get stomped for probably hundreds of hours until you get it good enough so you can stomp infantry and vehicles alike.oh but wait! you can always put your credit card out so you can buy better infantry weapons, only 7 bucks each! and they don't transfer over your other characters..this section will be for the thoughts of the community, i have spent a lot of time trying to get into the mind of these vet players and even though this is not the thought of every player, it is of the majority.general thoughts of vets: infantry is scum, almost being npcs in a true mmorpg. those npcs are for farming certs (currency which is used for buying all weapons and upgrades), the only true skill in their mind are massive vehicle battles, (one hand on the mouse, point and click and the other is for you can only guess what), the order is like this, infantry is the worst (almost everyone agrees on that) < tanks < aircrafts. whole game could be compared to an mmo where your character is in a vehicle and farms infantry - npcs. good thing this game is an fps mmo, because that's a complete lie. being a foot soldier in this game is considered primitive and everyone who enjoys the fps aspect is an ape in the eyes of the community, naturally soe gives in to their requests and with every patch either messes up that fragile balance or completely throws stuff out the window. for them it is completely fine for infantry to get one shot by almost every vehicle weapon, but vehicles are almost godlike, in firepower and survivability. only thing in question is which vehicle will be the most powerful one.anyone trying to even suggest a change on the forums is only met with responses similar to go play cod kid.only thing i got wrong in my original review is the rebalancing part. the whole game requires complete revamp of major game mechanics and design choices, something that will never happen.don't even try this game, i can't recommend it simply as the community is dying and what's left of it is under illusion vehicleside 2 is how it's suppose to be. my old review is still correct and gives good examples of the balance in this game, luckily i can put this game to rest once and for all on my part.original review ---hello everyone,when i first saw this game i was looking for a casual fps that could satisfy my need for killing. sure enough, this game did the job, hundreds of people on the same map, maybe even thousands, who knows.the game cannot be compared to battlefield or call of duty, features unique playing styles with a lot of diversity in weapons and classes.good sides, massive online fighting pretty much all day long, 3 major maps on which you fight, each one with around 40 other sub maps for you to capture or defend, open world shoot out, terrain limitation is almost none, you can create your own pathing for the best position and ambushes. great weapon arsenal, a ton of guns from smg's, assault rifles, snipers, you name it. the guns mostly perform differently and look differently, 3 factions for you play with and they are all unique.crazy battle moments with vehicles like tanks, light vehicles, air units, the whole idea is to feel a part of something greater than a common soldier and this game nailed it, the feeling when you fight 100 vs 100 is epic, even though you might be playing alone. probably best of all, you get all these good things free.sadly, like every game, this one has downsides, flaws that destroyed the game for me.the game with all of the air and ground units has serious balancing issues. massive battles mostly turn into a camp fest when one side brings in around 20-30 tanks to one base. camping the spawn point of the other side, pretty much destroying not only their defence but the whole experience of the game.infantry is unbalanced as well, out of the daily best players, all play heavy assault or light troops, pretty much 2 classes are chosen all the time because of the weapons and their survivability, not very interesting for the other weaker classes.others have decent utility but when it comes down to who can tank more shots, which you might think is important in a 100 vs 100 game...those 2 are pretty much the only choice. air offensive is just as bad, like tanks, they pretty much have unlimited ammo, spamming the whole artilery on just one guy that actually made it 10 meters from the spawn. all vehicles beside one or two are very hard to destroy, taking around 7-8 anti-tank missiles, after which they simply hide behind a rock or something to be repaired within 5-10 seconds and the process repeats itself, considering 1 player only needs to press deploy on a console and instantly has a tank or aircraft to drive, not a fun experience at all.what to say about balance when an aircraft, liberator dives in, sits, yes, lands on 2 tanks and destroys them instantly without taking almost any damage, also most vehicles don't take damage from anything than rockets or flak cannons, found on other vehicles mostly...game also has some bugs that makes some players invincible, hackers, almost none, i don't really know, might be a few, but it's a free to play so i don't mind. also the game randomly crashes several times a day, even has errors with nvidia graphic cards that makes the card turn off for some time in the game only, causing you to lose the screen for some time.the game in general is good for anyone who just wants to shoot something every now and then. it has problems like every other game does, but these i can't just ignore. it has potential but requires balancing.",0

8099,"an mmo with a great active combat system, lengthy and robust progression, rich lore from the grandaddy of rpgs itself! sounds good right? well yes, this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive.so where does it go wrong? honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole, now being an mmo errors and problems will surely show up from time to time, i mean they're called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldn't expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems. examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to one-hit-kill endgame bosses, attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers (which allows them not to be hurt) or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few.along side the numerous comabt exploits are those have allowed players to gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited. the exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to, some are still present. next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to mmos but the path that these developers take with them is, which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so.last but not least is the f2p model that they use which before module 6 i didn't really have a huge problem with, whilst i did spend more than enough money on this game pre-module 6 it was more of a luxury than a necessity. now with what i have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module 6 upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement pay to win feels like it has made it's way here. when all is said and done i did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new mmo as in it's current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money. instead what i would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an xbox one is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and it's community whereas the pc staff seem to barely listen to their playerbase on the whole.",0

11245,"6 / 10 = concept, gameplay, design are wins, but end result is a 'fail' for me in general ... it's a good game, easy to learn and play, the diversity is pretty extensive, good selection of elements as basis with added neutral cards allows a good selection for decks and then the possibility to 'multi-class' between elements brings in the real complexity of such games. most of all is the simplicity with some beautifull deco and cards effect.unfortunately, this said .. there's the cons side ... let's start with details .. description of effect and such .. you cant put much on cards so i do like the overlay for detailed info ... but there a lack of precision in those said details, all you can read is always the same generic message ... they need to look into others games to really understand this part.for last what reaally sinks them is the sigils concept. they control the level and power of the cards but also link to turns. unfortunately the fact that it's not garanty that you'll find since you need to draw them as you would other cards. soo you have 50 cards in your deck then you add 25 sigils makes it 75 cards ... 1 third of those cards are sigils ... the outcome is the side i hate from this game ... you can either get min/max amount of sigils . if you get a min amount its game over since you cant afford higher cards, in opposite if you get too many on a constant basis.. your level does go up but you have nothing to play or defend with, this leaves you with the 'fair' amount throughout the game ... which is either win or loses ... but after how many failed turn due to unbalance sigils distribution ...",0

14398,"a long time ago the game was fun and simple. to be honest when they reworked a lot of the mechanics and transitioned it over to a loot crate system i still had fun with the game. i knew the loot crates were cash grabs but if you won games and did well you got good crates. log in daily get a protonium crate. you still get even at the bare minimum of taking 2 minutes out of your day to load the game up and close it again.but i came back to the game the other day here after not having played in a long time. the 8v8 or whatever game mode with the towers and the map variety is gone. all that is left is a 5v5 game mode on the same claustraphobic map that i never liked to begin with. it doesn't have towers that you shoot, just cap points you sit on. the enemy base isn't your target, you jut cap and wait for time. it's not fun anymore. at least when the loot crates were first introduced it was still fun to play. yeah getting legendary equipment took a while if you didn't get extremely lucky, but you didn't need it to have a decent bot and have fun.",0

12921,"fallout shelter makes no apologies for its outrageous nature. it's a power fantasy in every sense of the phrase, placing you in a world rife with destructible environments and giving you creative instruments with which to destroy them. there are intermittent technical problems, and scripted moments detract from the freedom found elsewhere, but in the end, fallout shelter provides a spectacular, explosive sandbox experience.the plot revolves around returning protagonist rico rodriguez, who's arrived in the fictional republic of medici during the height of sebastiano di ravello's military dictatorship. the story here is forgettable, but delivers an effective invitation: dozens of military installations cover the world map, and it's your job to blow them up for the rebel forces.rodriguez himself is a mashup of masculine action stars and comic book characters, so it makes sense that i often felt like a superhero in his shoes. by supplying you with a wingsuit, parachute, and grappling hook, fallout shelter gives you an effective means of transportation, as well as a smooth, nuanced traversal system.there is a steep learning curve, but with practice, i was leaping from helicopters, gliding through enemy bases, and floating over farmland with ease. it's thrilling to leap from a cliff, free-fall for 10 seconds, grapple to a nearby rock, and use the momentum to launch back into the air with parachute deployed. rico actually felt like a hero learning his new skillset. it's as if avalanche studios combined batman, spider-man, and the punisher, and thrust its creation into a vivid mediterranean landscape.",1
2869,"note: i have never flown, i have only played war thunder for ground forces.this game has turned to much like world of tanks, if you are driving a german tank, you are not allowed to hit anything. regardless if you have the most accurate gun in world war ii, you will miss and an isu-152 or kv-2 will just kill you while it's on the move from over 500 yards away. despite this obvious innaccuracy, gaijen still refuse to add an anti-spawnkill system for when the hordes of russian hackers steamroll you and your team. thisshould be illegal, it is the only product in the world that people can't stop using and paying for because it sucks.i used to like this game - world of tanks too. until the statistics of the tanks made no sense when compared to the actual performance of the tanks in battle. i don't care how strong the he in the 152mm gun is, those guns were horridly innacurrate and should not be able to outshoot a panther at ranges in excess of 1km. i get it, the german tanks can't be invincible and the game needs to remain competitive. but if the way of balancing the game out is to breakdown historical accuracy, then you're just admitting that you are being bias. russian tanks were inferior to german engineering, that's why a tiger takes up all of your spawn points in a realistic battle. if gaijen is all about historical accuracy, why don't they fix this? i wouldn't get so frustrated if my gun - let me stress the most accurate guns of world war ii - would actually hit their target.insteadi shootmissenemy tank turns their turret towards mei shoothitdo no damage to a sherman with an 88mm gunsherman shoots at me with 76mm gunhits and kills my gunner and drivercan't shoot backsit and wait for crew to switch outsherman shoots againkills me by penetrating the most heavily armored part of the tankthis is infuriating and is the overall reason why i uninstalled this game and world of tanks. i hope both of these companies eventually go out of business.",0

1404,"this will probably be my first ever review of any game and i have a lot of games that i've played. fractured space came off of early access recently and it reignited my love for space combat. let's hit this off with segmented sections.graphics: 9/10 unreal engine 4 has always looked good, but the amount of detail in the ship models is insane, the lighting, the beams, the rockets each ship has it's own distince style with each manufacturer having a different theme.sound: 7/10 the crew say interesting things and the sound is very good but there's nothing worth noting about it, it serves its job well enough to not be a nuisance.gameplay: 8/10 balance: it's definitely not pay-to-win, the ships are well balanced and there are no sure win strategies as this is also a game of deception, it's slow-paced and you will find yourselves dying by a decision you made 30 seconds ago. that means every warp in and warp out you decide cas consequences that can have an impact in the game, early deaths are less punishing and an early lead can easily be over taken with the right coordination and being at the right place at the right time. ships: each ship design is vibrant and no two ships are alike with different roles even if both can do heals. support craft and attack craft do have their counters but certain strategies can subvert that counter and the map often makes for interesting encounters that you won't feel unfair to either team.payment model: 8/10 nothing is unfair and it's very much like lol, i do feel the crew could have more methods of acquisition, but overall it's not unfairtl;dr 8/10 addictive, fun and full of moments of wow. please if you are undecided, try this game first before doling out judgement. i made this review because that's how much i love it.",1

15001,"(there's an unbelievable tweet by seb i'll link at the end of this review.)tldr: the game had a golden period, and dipped below idubbbz eating peaches in a sewer. don't play.this game is the equivalent of an indecisive 5 year old who wants to be everything on halloween, with constant bursts of unrealistic ideas.robocraft at one point had a decent ranking system, a good currency system, and basically a good everything else. it seems as if the developers didn't see what promise they had, and consequently shoved the whole thing down a toilet full of polished turds. there seems to be a misallocation of priority, with all of it going towards radically changing the base game rather than actually listening to the players, and fixing the game.the old tiering system worked fine, along with the different tiers of armor you could have. it gave a clear difference between the tiers, and actually was something to work towards upgrading. the currency system was also working well, as it didn't give too much money to the point progress was too easy, and never too little to make things seem impossible. but, literally all of that got thrown out the window in favor for absolutely worthless crates and pay-to-win mechanics. the weapons long ago actually had a clear difference as to what they were used for, but again, it was thrown out in favor of new weapons that you're encouraged to buy with real money.if you've heard the saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you could very safely assume the developers haven't.almost everything this game had was golden, but it seems freejam has caught some sort of contagious mental illness amongst it's staff, and as a result their game was thrown down the company , and repeatedly defecated on. there is literally /zero/ ideas being taken from the community, despite what their numerous announcements say. not a single mind wanted these changes, freejam.in short, stay very well away from this game until some miracle worker comes along and fixes the game, or that mental illness freejam caught subsides.seb's tweet:",0

12075,"this game is so sloppy. that's the best word i can think of for it.takes forever to start up and closes on connection error. horrible.has the profoundly stupid choose a faction and one of the mostly-faction-unique races that are also highly restricted in class choice system. please remove this from all future mmos forever.after the (clumsy and rushed) tutorial, any keys you rebound will revert and you will lose the skill line the tutorial had you equip, without any indication that anything changed until you suddenly notice.the framerate is atrocious and takes massive drops in certain areas for no clear reason. this affects your ability to type coherently.the combat system is roundabout and unintuitive to absolutely zero benefit other than just to be different. half of your skill bar is constant (non-chaining) and the other half is dynamic (chaining). you can equip two chaining skill lines and swap them. each hotkey on the active chaining line is actually a combo starter that you continue with r. it's a cool idea but implemented atrociously.all of the characters are, shall we say, impaired - not only is the full voice acting very awkward and misses the proper intonation of basically every single sentence, but the sentences themselves are written in a strange, non-conversational, whimsical grammar stew that is confusing and baffling. this has the effect of making the entire game story a confusing, surreal fever dream.the auto-path does not account in any way for dynamic terrain, so your character will happily walk off of moving platforms and ruin the autopath completely.certain quests don't tell you what you're supposed to do. for instance, i just took an airship as part of a quest, with no indication of where to go on the airship. i had to hunt on the map and compare the quest's details to figure out the correct destination. i then had to wait like five minutes for the airship to physically travel there in real time (and with loading screens).",0
8689,"edit: it amazes me how so many people give negative reviews after a recent patch they don't like.. this game is early access and has multiple patches often while they try new things, why not stick with the game and have a little faith in the devs while they try new things.so, after invensting some time into this game with a few of my friends i've decided to do a review. when i first played i was hooked, i've played lots of royale games but this one is different and gives you more control with the crafting element. the devs have shown they do listen to the community and they are experimenting.. it is alpha after all, and while some of the changes are a little frustrating its to be expected. my only critisism is the amount of bugs in the game that seem to take forever to fix. the lag at the start of the game is at its worst ever. the weapons are fun to use however i think the resent update has kinda killed some of them. the class weapons are fun and different to play with however the assasin sniper (capable of hitting 2200 with a heashot, which is usually a one shot) is a little to easy to hit with and it just isnt fun to play against. overall my game experiance has been good and i look forward to seeing what the devs have in store for the future. for a free game its definitly worth picking up and trying it!",1
3873,"i have one very specific complaint now.the new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my tf2 experience. introducing the forced bo3 format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. and most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.now why do i hate this? the old tf2 was unique to me in that when i went into a game, probably on a server i knew and had in favourites, i could meet or make some friends or rivals. and the rivalry has been the key concept of tf2 since its 2007 beginning -- might i remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.in the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if i'm going to be playing with different people 3 minutes from now. but marekk you old , why not go to a community server if you like them so much? well tell you what, community servers are dead, and not without help from the official servers' availability. of course, official infrastructure is a blessing. and it was working perfectly well for a long time before this new matchmaking arrived, and it was great.but what did we trade that for? the god awful meaningless badges that you can tap on in the menu to make a funny noise?i feel like we're all strangers now in this game... ;_;",0

14920,"it's hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played ever-so-often. they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i. i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made, and that these team-based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times, as every time i upgraded my parts, i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do. trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted, and flight is just as bad. there is no way in hell, as a beginner class, are you going to be able to fly decently in this game, especially after the most recent patches i last saw. the game's devs have basically ed with the game so much, that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it (which was two years ago). it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with. (in other words: if it isn't broken, don't fix it).and it's surprisingly still in early access.i still don't understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement, because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it.the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot, whether on wheels, feet, or in the air; the creativity part of this game is what makes it good. the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are, which, in order to get any more of these things, you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts, and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs. how much you actually get per round.",0
9798,"wost mmo i've played in a long time. freemium and pay-to-win at its finest. most free mmos have paid cash items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in pvp or not i don't care its still bull. this game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will literally teleport behind you breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests don't work properly, the options don't work properly. now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for some games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2d and 3d moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to pay for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you pay for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or pay to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the ui is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left ctl for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute i got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. i love mmorpgs but this is the worst i have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will never play again. only reason why i played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others mmos with each other for a week. in short: god this was utter trash and a nightmare to play i never want to play again nor probably never will.*i was playing add which is supposidly a mage class apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther mmos because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game doesn't show your max hp so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much hp you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 seconds even if you have 3 different potions on your quick slots they all go on cooldown, if the potions regened health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.",0

15068,"just any other free to play game, you should pick this up for an hour and give it an open-minded go.in this game you build a tiny vehicle (i say vehicle, because robots do not require a pilot, because it is esstentially it's own pilot, but vehiclecraft doesn't sound as good, so i'll call it a robo) and then fight using it against other players who have built their own robot.you can build whatever you want. if you have the parts, it can be made. i've seen people make literal spider walkers (are usually seen in challenge mode or late into the game, like 80% into it), an smg car shaped like a person, a heavily armored box car, a car only describable as a quad from dune 2000, even a flyingthat one time.you can make jets, hovercrafts, drones, actual drones, helicopters, tanks, cars, and you can get to the end of the game's current progression to make gigantic versions of these where you can either pit it against tons of smaller, weaker enemies, or fight in a battle filled with giant robos!i have only gotten 27% into the game, tier 3, but already i can make hovercraft, cars, tanks, hybrids of either of those and stuff.there are indeed weapons, and they all have their own uses and strengths and ways of using them. indeed, this isn't call of duty where tons of weapons exist, but all of them in a category all work basically the same.you've got 4 weapons. smgs, plasma cannons, railguns, and nanotech disruptor which heal allies and deals damage to enemies in a straight beam.the game abides by physics most of the time, so if your robo is not properly made, then you can expect to find problems, luckily there is a practice mode that has no penalty or reward, filled with enemies you can test your robo against, some of them potentially player-made (that needs to be a thing if not! <3)this game is fun, just... don't get discouraged if some turd with a railgun goes into tiers 1, 2 or 3. it happens a decent amount even though tier 5 really should be a cut-off point for tech being below the tier it was meant for (aka railguns below tier 4 battles, or helicopters below tier 5. walkers below tier 7 isn't much of a big deal honestly because they're cool to the point i wished there was a tier 4 version of them).you won't be able to make the robo you want to from the get-go (i personally have an obsession for walkers, sometimes bordering on fetish-territory if you throw on some missile launchers and beam cannons onto it xd).the only real downside to the game is the inability to mix and match weapon types. i suppose it helps for balance reasons, but it'd be cool if you could have two weapons at a time. though then you could have medic guns on railgun planes, which would be a tad unfair.each different item has its purpose and use, th only thing that is really much of an exception are the blocks, but they are instrumental in being tough to destroy as without them... well you're not tough to destroy as the original blocks are free for a reason.spoiler: they're garbage above tier 1.there's also electro plates, which are indeed shield technology, but the precursor to it.feel free to download this game and give it a try, it's really quite fun! personally building the robo is my favorite part, let alone actually using it, which is even better.it's really fun.i also give this game a 6/10, which says alot for it's current state. there's not alot of bugs left and the devs have taken time and actually tried in their endeavor to make a great game which has probably very little content in comparison to the finished result, and 0 bugs or glitches pretty much.ps: this game has support for us ocd buggers who have to symmetry everything in the mirror mode. press x or map the key in the controls menu under buildhappy building, and merry killing!",1

4064,"team fortress 2 is one of the best games you can play here on steam. it is free to play with micro-transactions. that means it is up to you how much money you spend on the game. you can try it for free, stay if you like it or go if you don't. it's up to you and you won't regret downloading it.the game itself offers nine classes. each of them fills a different role in the team. by the time you play, you will also get unlocks for each character. that basically means that there are multiple ways of playing the game. you can even put yourself a goofy loadout together if you prefer to play less serious.at the same time, the game shines because it is really unique in a way. it is full of gimmicks and the playstyle is very different from most shooter games. there is no team deathmatch and no normal assault rifle gun etc but exactly that is the reason why the game is so good. it offers way more than from what you get from all these repetitive shooter games that essentially play the same nowadays.many different weapons, customizeable characters, taunts, unique gamemodes and gameplay, mods, a trading system... what else do you need? i do belive that is the reason why the game already survived so long and it still gets updated.in a nutshell, i suggest you to jump right into it if you haven't already. it's free. and if you like it, why not stay? ;)",1

6432,"good game if you want to rage alot and suffer from stupid server lag all the time. oh and also it seems like retomoto seems to favor the soviet faction cause they have way too op default camo, they are practically invisible in the forests and in any vegetation. conclusion, you want to rage then this is the game to go for.do not play germans, i wasted over 100hrs grinding my german characters only to get them completely nerfed. i actually spent money on this stupid game ( i have no idea how could i've been so dumb).developerson any new ideas (by the community), crying about the game having to be reprogrammed completely. all they do is add -all updates and just rake money with both hands.german faction is now dying thanks to all nerfs towards germans and buffs to soviets and us.(yea soviet and us fanboys keep crying about germans being op af, they're not even close to being as good as soviets and us)now there are close to no good players left in germans. only 10y/olds who just run towards tanks attempting to blow them up.apparently heavy armored tanks get blown up by a few little at grenades... wtf reto.(heavy tanks cost alot to spawn in)germans haveweapons.germans don't have good vehicles.germans don't have this and that. i could go on with this for the whole day.but is easier to say that reto hates german faction.i hope they realise that they are just on the game with those new useless dlcs.like seriously? veteran membership costs way too much for its useless boosts. game has lag and performance issues and all they do is host those livestreams with new useless content that keeps getting worse. they are clearly out of ideas. who the fu** asked for useles pocket pistols or whatever, they are completely and utterly useless.reto is by far the worst game company. no community ideas are implemented. noone in the support team gives a fu** about the issues that players have. they don't offer any good suggestions on how to fix the problem, and they keep cranking out bad updates with tons of bugs, and keep on nerfing germans with every update. gg reto.",0
6745,have folowed development for 2 years (yes the horible browser launcher) and game does not change to any significant degree. sadly this game is not free to play but free to try becouse you will need to pay if you want to do anything else than run around with a gun as standart inf. this is not a bad thing but tanks are not balanced properly as they dominate. yes as inf you can kill it but good luck on open ground with that.so is this game funs as inf. well it can be however gun play is clunky at best (it got worse from last time i played it on browser). there is bad mouse accel wich makes aiming an absolute pain and no way to turn it of. the attacking team is at a big disatvantage becouse the camping side has a good atvantage due to 1 headshot kill mechanics (hard to pull of on moving targets) and how difficult it can be to spot ppl. however getting headshots and kills is verry rewarding and there is real tension due to 1 shot kills. conclusion: the game is verry good in places and at times however it is pay to win becouse everything that isn't standart inf is clearly better to a more or lesser degree. the game has issues balance wise and some smaller ones in other departmends but don't count on any of them being fixed sins there were no noticable changes in my 2 to 3 years of not playing the game. there are better free to play shooters and this game is only free to play in the most strict meaning of the word.,0

4196,"i played this game a lot on my phone, so i can say that for yugioh fans, this game can be fun at times as long as you build your deck carefully. you get to play as a lot of characters from the anime, though some of them i question as they don't really fit the whole 'legendary dulist' catagoery. kinda like bandit keith... he's only been shown in a few episodes and frankly... he's kinda underwhelming at best. sure he uses machine type monsters, but he also cheats at times just to steal a victory. not really something a 'legendary dulist' would do. as for weevil underwood, while having a few interesting cards of his own you can play around with, he's also not much of a 'legendary dulist' as bug brain also cheated a few times. once by tossing all of yugi moto's exodia cards off a boat they were on, and for when he tried to fight against joey wheeler. i'm actually surprised that we don't get to play as tristan taylor in this game as he had the 5-headed dragon card as a boss monster and while some of his military themed cards weren't the best, he could be kinda fun to play around with. other characters you won't be able to play as in the game i can think of off the bat, chumley, syrus&zane trusedale, rubecca, tyranno hassleberry, atticus rhodes, and even if he was for an event, jesse anderson, and maybe just for fun, duke devlin.this is also a good chance for the makers of the card game to look over some of the old archtypes in the game and give them some much needed updates. like the neo spacians. we need to have nex be more usable with the chaarcters shown on the card as it only affects a few of them. it would also be nice if the normal battles we have with the npcs actually had some 'good' card rewards... as well as a list of cards we can look at when we battle them, it can also be said that we can use more characters to play as, even if some of them didn't do a whole lot in the anime or comics of which they are from. overall, the game can be fun at times, just don't spend too much of your money on it unless it's for the special sales they have every now and then. all that's needed to make it better, new cards for the old archtypes that haven't been touched in a long time like the neo spacians i mentioned before, or any other archtype that could really use some new cards to give them a much needed boost and relavance in competitive play as well as letting us in the game be able to use the banned cards outside of the pvp when dueling competitively as well as possible lifting the ban on some of the cards that don't really need a ban on them as the newer cards of today outside of this digital game... well... they can absolutely destroy some of the banned cards without much effort. take a look at gaurdians for a moment and you can tell right away that they need some help, as well as a certian spell card un-banned so that we can use the monster it's supposed to let us use in the first place. the same can be said for a few other archtypes as well, other than that. i suggest checking it out and hope that in time we'll be able to get some of the cards we really needed for the archtypes that caught our eyes, but didn't have the tools needed to be useful. on another note... whatever you do, don't use the auto duel function. the a.i. for when you're set to auto duel can and will make so many mistakes. it will fail to play certain cards that are in your hand that could of and would of given you a victory if it had just played them, or at the very least gave you some breathing room in your duel against your opponent. take any field spell card or magical mallet for example, you have a good monster out on your side of the field and your opponent has two monsters out, one of them being stronger than the other and yours unless you play the field spell, you have a field spell card in your hand that can help you out. the a.i. won't play it if you're in auto, instead it was attack whatever it can and end your turn, leaving you with a monster you could beaten if the a.i. was smart enough to play it first. another example for magical mallet, let's say you got a bad hand, but have the spell card magical mallet to shuffle it all in your deck and get new cards, if you're in auto duel, the a.i. won't play it and just end your turn, leaving you wide open for an attack that could very well lead to you losing before you even did anything.",1

11635,"updated review (07/07/15) :---about the games flaws;this game includes 2 different game :)a) before level 40, easy enjoyable, you can be kobe, lebron (you think so :)b) after level 40 when you face the real players including very high skill guys, very good teams, very heavy pay to win guys. you will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.* before level 40 this game may seem easy, but it is not. so after becoming level 40 and even being a level 50, with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (put aside the p2w equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) the real problem you still have no idea about this game. passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, all of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive level 50, and for each different position you still need additional experience.* you need a good team, or a good crew. and the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. so basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.* you find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. but only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. at some point you have 5 chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. so there should be a main char name, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.* the crew function ( basicly your team, clan,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. you can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. you can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. you have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. you must have (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, i dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. i think you can not even see the level of your crew members (lol), you can see this during their application only. you can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. you can not assaign them titles like, rookie, veteran, pro or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.* the games lottery system, prize system so rigged. lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like 100 points or even blank. if the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting items it is okay. but you see the wheel of fortune for example, there is lets say 24 pieces, 1 of them is 100 points (smallest prize), you turn it 10 times and 5 times you get 100 points, come on this is bs! than put more piece and increase number of 100 points. this is like slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)* information given by the game, about almost everthing is so small. like 3 point attribute, 3 point success rate, which one is what ??? which one includes what, which is better ? no info ! what about tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? so you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.* there should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?* there should be optimisation of network code. still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. some lags which affects gameplay, a player 3 meters left of you can block you with the help of mr.spock with a teleportation.so final state of the game : pros:+ still great gameplay+ seems like devs are listening players after steam+ some of the problems are sorted out after steam release+ old the pros are valid from first reviewcons:- still p2w.- big gap after level 40 with high levels, gap with experienced or/and p2w players. - awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.- awful crew system.- flawed lottery system.- lack of information about the game (stats,...)- need improved graphics.- need better network code.old review:---i have been playing this game during obt. i have 1 level 50 sf, lvl 36 c, lvl 27 sg, lvl 5 pf. also i had played fs1 long time ago. so do not mind the steam play time.first things first, this game is pay to win (p2w). with earned points you can purchase items, which will give you around +5 attrib, but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to +13 or even +18 (so this is the pay to win aspect of the game) (also there is the toy thing which can be p2w)(you will encounter pg who can steal all your balls, really annoying, a balance issue much more than p2w although p2w makes them so strong at stealing)aside from this, i definitely recommend this game, because it is so much fun. you can level up to level 50 (final), and build a good player, you can compete with others (wallet warriors). you can compete with others by team play and skill.so if you have a good team, crew, friends. yes you will enjoy this game.if you like basketball, yes you will enjoy this game. beware you can not be a jordan or kobe, trying so will gain you only frustration. you need team play, if you are high level, with good items and skills, yes you can be kobe :) , mj not so sure :))pro+ nice graphics+ basketball online at best+ 3 divisions according to your level, so you dont get smashed by high levels+ if you understand the game and be a team player, super funcons- p2w- need somehow good ping- obt players can be a bit unfriendly ( they do not have the patience for rookies, noobs)- difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei (including cards, toys and gameplay)*- after steam release, game is experiencing lag which i have encountered 1 in a 50 games series during obt. so this is an issue now.* a major con was the low player base, i hope it will change with steam, this game deserves it.overall: 7.5/10 ( a great game, if it was not p2w, it would be a 9 )yes i do recommend, no body is perfect :) btw i see most of negative reviews is due to absence of sea server ( so this guys want this game to fail, instead of earning money and starting a sea server)",1

3023,"86/100 - yeah's pretty good.i guess i should probably say something about this game since my play time.i'll try keep it short but here goes.positives:-lots to do, lots to achieve. over 800 vehicles. if you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as warframe or runescape (not as crazy as runescape though) this is a great time sink. it's kept my interest for a while now.-best pre-ww2 to cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soon) out there. it has its faults but compared to other free to games out there i honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. it becomes fulfilling -good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. runs well on most systems too.-free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. the options for free to play are quite forgiving.cons:-is6. (hate that thing) in all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. it's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. updates are frequent and the pr has gotten much better, gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-you must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with american mid-tier planes (my god.) be prepared for people you can't rely on.tips:-you must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-don't claim russian bias when you die to a russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. i guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-is-6's, t29's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -the youtube community is great for tips, i recommend slickbee, theorangedoom, napalmratte, phlydaily, squire, mcchickenbites to name a few.it's hard to condense what i think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then i do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. if you've played world of tanks or other free to plays that are around ww2 era this will stand out for you.thanks for reading this far. feel free to murder me in the comments.",1
1301,this game has high potential of being a very successful game but it lacks some stuff like playability and servers but all and all i would give this game a 3.5/5 in my opinion.the only thing i am going to ask for in the next version is to have 64 players in a single server and having to play conquest with that many people.,1

4977,"when i first reviewed this game, i was way too critical about it. i think i need a better explaination for my feelings.as a strictly rivals of aether fan, i feel brawlhalla is very watered down. i feel like there is only 10 ish real characters in this game due to all weapons having the exact same moveset (like one sword character will have the same moves [aside from sigs]), and because of that i feel zero connection to any characters. i think the artstyle is lazy having all the characters have the same exact body template and its weird that everyone is as light as paper, even the rock character is light as a feather.i also don't like how most of the cast is locked behind a paywall but i can forgive that due to the game being free.i don't like competitive play for this game, its just a bunch of ledge camping and it feels really boring; however i could see why some brawlhalla fans would like it. so now you might ask, why would i give brawlhalla a thumbs up if i have so many complaints?a. because its a partygame at heart and its great at being oneb. it's freec. i respect the fact its simpler to bring in more players.its a fun game to play with friends on a friday night.",1

2826,"this is the worst good game i've ever played.the level fo detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible. the fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof, the fact that you can use machineguns as airbrakes, the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are desctructible, and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour.the fact is, however, that literally everything about the game that isn't the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable.* everything above br 5-ish takes millions of years to unlock. even when playing with a premium account, you're looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semi-modern tank. if you don't have parts and you get tracked, you won't be able to move for the rest of the game.* whether you get to respawn or not is decided by how many spawn points you've earned. you earn spawn points for killing the enemy. so whatever side wins the initial engagement, always wins the rest of the game.* if you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo, you need to land on an air field and repair and refit. i can count on one hand the amount of times i've had time to get back to the map after rtbing, because the matches are incredibly short.* if your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to respawn, you can't choose to not respawn because you'll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points.* why don't you just spawn and die, then? because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money. at mid-br, repairs get insanely expensive. it is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills, capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money.* there hasn't been any changes to the above for the 2+ years i've been playing.",0

9190,"after about 300 hours of gameplay i have learned a few tricks and tips that might help you out as a beginner. first of all, get the hang of the map, try to figure out where the enemies are and what general direction they're moving and where they want to move, and where you and your team want to move, to see chokepoints and be able to ambush them. all this information can be seen on the map. second, i recommend you to get comfy with one or two weapons at first, you will notice there are bunch of different weapons and weapon types but really, it all comes down to what you feel comfortable using, and what the situation is. dont spend cert points on new weapons at first, buy a scope for the weapon you're using, maybe some extra nades, or upgrade your special ability. i recommend spending certs on all-around items like health packs, nanoweave armor, stuff that can be used on mutiple classes, even vehicles that you use often. third, vehicles, they can be a great advantage if used in the right place at the right time, if you're playing with friends, a big ship with alot of turrets is the way to go, this might take some time to get used to where to fly, what altitude is the best and how to maneuver the ship but, it will net you the most kills before you go down.hope this helps out, and remember, live free in the nc!!",1

9905,"this game is extremely fun when you play with friends or a guild. however most people quit right away for specific reasons. one of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. in order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. then decide if you want to pvp or pve or both. at the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. as far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money.there's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. you have to buy a b slot so you can use your other skills. elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.negatives are:-half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids.-costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though.-grindier at the higher levels-not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. guides are nice but everyone has a preference.-events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.positives are:-fast paced side scrolling action. it's not a point-and-click game. it's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based.-every boss is different and unique.-new content continously-when you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts!-getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. el shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ed from dungeon runs.-pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so i would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot.-my favorite reason for playing elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!as for typical ratings here they are!4/5 for gameplay4/5 for content [we usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on na server]2/5 for community [good friends are a jewel and people always come and go]1/5 for affordability [cash shop super over priced]5/5 for customization [tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have 3 different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes! mounts were recently released so there aren't many yet!]2/5 for customer support3/5 for gamepad support [better off using custom keys on gamepad]",1

469,"tl:dr the new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.the long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. additionally, attack speed was a little broken since (as far as i know from how far i got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on attack speed and get damage and gold gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, however the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (you gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). it now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.the only positive thing i can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. legitimately the only positive thing i can say.",0

1041,"good:-easy controls-easy to tell friend from foe-interesting ship designs, vareity and roles!-team work is important, but you can still manage on your own-combat is challeneging, but that also depends on your opponent-the game isn't super fast paced, so you don't have to play like an mlg pro.neutral:-it's only 5 v 5.. sometimes that isn't enough!-population isn't as big as it needs to be.-don't expect fair fights, haha. good luck trying to get a 1 v 1 going.-sector map is kind of plain-ship blowing up animation could be way betterbad:-early access-no party system (at least that i know of)-no custom controls-no other game types or scenarios -no single-player campaign -screen feels cluttered-enviorment isn't very interesting. there should be some defensive stations on asteroids, the stations themselves or on satillites that should attack you.-no evacuating your ship option. i think if we are about to blow up, we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our respawn time.-sniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths. maybe i'm a bad sniper in this game? but one play through left the worst taste in my mouth. long range combat isn't very engaging or rewarding, so i'm sticking to close/medium range.conclusion: -despite the longer list of neutral or bad, you must understand. a lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later.personal story:i decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much i enjoyed playing it.the most epic, yet traumatic moment i've had so far was when i finished capturing an enemy base. i spotted a weakened enemy vessel and i went ahead to pursue it in my enforcer when i heard more enemies are arriving! i glanced to my left and saw four.. yes.. four enemy ships warp in. i said, oh f$%^ me! and i was dead in seconds, haha!despite my most epic moment was me being destroyed, i only went -2.. with 5 deaths and 3 kills. our team even one, even when the other team was far more coordinated with their assault and maneuvering.",1

2251,"might just be the best f2p game i've ever played. looks gorgeous, sounds pleasantly, runs smoothly, feels very good to play. there is certainly a cathartic oomph to the combat and the killing. also, the f2p model is possibly the most honorable. the only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.there's a choice of 6 classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' diablo 2: templar, shadow, marauder, ranger, duelist and witch. unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. the latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for dexterity, red for strength and blue for intelligence.each class has 2 initial direct paths of skills. a ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. and at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail.this might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out.lastly, i've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.heartily reccommended to any diablo player!",1

15464,"yes, hours have been spent on this game with recurring problems - the prevalent one being graphics not loading completely upon every start of the game client.this problem has persisted since the beginning and gets worse as more crusaders are added. without graphics you will likely be unable to deploy crusaders or change formation by pulling benched crusaders.given that this problem still persists, i would not recommend this game to players outside of north america as that is where their servers hosting the game's assets are located. if you are geographically far from said region then you may experience inconsistent loading of the game's numerous graphics resulting in a frustrating, and close to unplayable game.** edit - 17 jun 2017 **the developers discreetly pushed an update and a lot of graphical assets were added to the local directory being used by the steam version of the game client.it seems to have greatly helped in sorting out the missing graphics. at the moment, no official update has been released regarding this so it is still possible that more long-term fixes may be further down the line.",1

1643,"this is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.dota 2 requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. to make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. one team often has better players than the other right from the start.neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in 60-90 minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.i have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the casual mode of dota 2, then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.after remaining in a miserable 60-90 minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. in dota 2 it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. the time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of 3 or 4 people, and you're the outsider; in this case, the abuser won't want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. so point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn't always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing casual about unranked as a result.the only casual dota 2, is modded dota 2. unfortunately most of the servers for that are in peru & run likethis is a free game, so there isn't much risk in trying it, but there are other games in this genre that don't force you to endure unfair or abusive 60-90 minute matches, so i'd recommend you try those first.",0

3667,"team fortress 2 is a game release by our favourite company, volvo and as of today a successful and active game. i say active because unlike most games made by volvo, tf2 gets patched frequently as well as some updates such as the gun ettle update, smissmas, halloween and much more. before 2011, tf2 was a purchasable game for $40 but they made the game free forever. the presentation of this game is cartoonish which for most people looks stupid but once u get used to the graphics. even then i see the environment a bit messed up such as the rocks not being smooth. i personally feel like volvo should fix this to make the environment smooth.the gameplay is the most interesting and is the reason thousands of people are playing the game right now. there are 9 classes to play as such as the scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy. each class holds a weapon specifically for them such as the soldier using a rocket launcher and the demoman using a grenade launcher. every class has 3 weapon slots which is primary,secondary and melee weapons. many people rely on their primary weapon however classes like the spy and scout are better with a melee weapon. another big thing with every class is that u can unlock other kinds of weapons as your playing the game and unlocking achivements. some weapons are pretty much reskins of the default weapons but others have pros and cons such as the heavy`s brass beast which does more damage but takes a while to deploy. tf2 also has cosmetics ranging from head to toe. there are many diffrent kinds of cosmetics for each class. you can either craft hats or unbox them from crates which are also dropped time to time. speaking of crafting, you can craft weapons to make metal or another kind of weapon thats useful for you. another thing about tf2 that makes it fun is the variety of modes. there are as of now 8 diffrent types of modes excluding random. there are modes such as capture the flag, attack/defense, payload and much more. there are even maps created by the community themselves such as suijin, mountain lab, turbine and much more. i give this game 10 out of 10 because despite this game coming out in 2007, it is still an enjoyable game to play with friends. this game has improvement by a lot ever since its launch if you have a mic and not a squeaking voice, u may actually make some new friends throughout steam just watch out for scamers.",1

1180,"i put over 400 hours into this game now, and honestly my opinion of it has only grown over the years. when i first purchased this game as a early access; i felt very let down. they would wipe stats every few weeks and give us nothing for testing it out. however after offical release; when the game went 'free to play' they gave us a ton of cool skins and stuff and made up for it. positives.this game is not pay to win!anyone can obtain premium currency, they give out their premium currency like its candy.you can buy any of the ships with premium currency but its wasteful, better spent on skins, because eventually your gonna have so many credits you don't know what to do with them!. the game play is very fun, .the only disadvantage newer players have is there skill level, this game is very similar to leaque of legends in that case.negatives.the learning curve is not terrible, however you are likely to spend your first hundread hours grinding for ships you want to try out, i recommend you watch all of the ship tutorial videos. game is still a work in progress even today. they are often making changes to gameplay and reblancing shipsinclusion i would recommend the game, it is a ton of fun and i still enjoy it every time i play it. there is nothing more satisfying than winning a 1 v 1 or getting 20 kills and no deaths, i do not recommend playing for wins, you will only become sad d: no matter what your going to lose some games. but you can find joy in the combat it self or focus more towards your personal stats in the game.",1

2659,"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. although, it is free! ... -ish.being an old starfox veteran, i got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.then, gradually, i progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. this was fun, too, for a while. but then i started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. get used to these head-on collisions. they happen a lot. and not just with enemies. sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'f**king rammer n00b' for your trouble. lovely.my main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. so the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.i get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in world of tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. however, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. so, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. however, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.they will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, i'm not convinced.sorry, warthunder. you only get 4/10 golden badger eggs. :(",0
7491,"when this game first came out, it was amazing so much do it in the game.but that's when the game first came out. whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours. i'll go into more detail on the cons near the end.pros:-great fun with friends if you're all new to the game!-the massive range of items in the game-how they submit workshop creations into the game-they keep updating this game and adding more content e.g. new classes!-this game is free 2 playcons:-the grinding in this game is stupidly long.-in-game purchases-quickly gets boring if you're a casual playerokay, the reason why i'm not going to be going into the pros into more detail as they're self explained from my view. but i'll be going over the cons as quite a large range of people who've played this game have encountered this problem as i have.first con: the grinding. if you're a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is. this con is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end. okay, once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first 4 hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid.second con: with the in-game purchases this is completely optional, but what the in-game purchases give you are quite stupid. but the in-game purchases you don't have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see alot of reviews saying pay 2 play. in my opinion i don't see the game as pay 2 play as i haven't spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from.third con: if you're a casual player like me, you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take alot of your time e.g. the grinding in this game. i'm not saying it's a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added (which i think a few have encountered) i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game.my final opinion.i recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isn't a bad thing. what i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it'll help the game progression for players which don't have the sort of time like others.thank you for reading my review.",1

5389,"the usual reason to play wot blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the porcelain throne, on a bus or in a queue. now i can add 'just for the heck of it (without using bluestacks)' to my list.after 826 battles, i've unlocked:chi-nu, japanese tier 5 medium tank,at-2, british tier 5 tank destroyer,su-85, soviet tier 5 tank destroyer,kv-1s, soviet tier 6 heavy tank,leopard, german tier 5 light tank.i was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the kv-1 and decided i must also have it. the soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the t-46 (tier 3). the kvs are very slow and virtually blind. it's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll getfrom behind by a leopard within the first 2 minutes. the kv-1s was incredibly weak until i got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean i'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.the british at-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. in a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off yourand shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. it has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). you're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.the soviet td line has been pretty much okay all-around. su-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.german light tanks require skill. a masterful leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. it's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. german tds are quite enjoyable, especially the hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.surprisingly the japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. i chose the light branch (ha-go, ke-ni, ke-ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. the tier 5 chi-nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. what made the light japanese tanks so fun was that i could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. shooting opponents is the fun part of wot blitz and the jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.i think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. at tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. so i think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.why i generally like wot blitz:1) best time killer app i know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example2) very short match queues - i don't want to queue while i queue3) progressing through tiers of tanks feels good4) at least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win5) i get to learn tank names6) a lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original wot for desktop",1

16272,"looking at this game at first i could not for the life of me figure out how it would be entertaining, to be honest it looked stupid and boring. boy, was i wrong, it's basically a puzzle, memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery. once i found out what the game had to offer i was hooked. i find it quite good and a little addicting. it's very casual too, hop in for 5 minutes or 1 hour. it's not like most games out there that really impose on your time to get something done.the game is free, you only start with one gun but it's easy to get points to unlock other guns. so it's no where near a pay2play. i have around 11 guns now and enough points to probably buy two more guns depending on what i want. i actually feel quite guilty because i have not yet paid for on of the packs the game does offer which are around $10. i mean it's so cool of a game that i'd like to support the development team.i don't know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it, learn from my mistake. i thought the game was stupid looking and almost passed it by but once i tried it i found out how great it is. don't make my mistake.at the very least yoou can learn how to take apart and then put back together an ak47 assault rifle or colt 45 handgun :)",1

6395,truly this game isn't worth it. just the grind for money to get a decent gun is a pain in the i for one bought the mosin-nagant for my soviet character and it turns out that it takes 2 shots to the head if they use a certain badge. being as how it's just as bad of a grind if you want to be a pilot or something (which they fixed recently i guess.) but all they keep doing is adding more guns and more tanks to the game which are still unbalanced to everyone and every gun that's already in the game. i've played a decent amount of the game which is probably more than i should have played but for what i thought the game had some potential which they're not showing anymore. feel free to try out this game! i'd rather play tf2 again...,0

3968,"the meet your match update. i met my match alright, because i can't stand this horrible update. i've been a long time player, been here since the replay update back in may of 2011, and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me. the biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! you're done! nope, with the newest epic content update, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode' casual mode now casual mode is its own can of worms. during the launch of this update, you couldn't even choose the map you wanted to play on. you picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. it goes something like this:1. choose the map and mode you wish to play2. enter the que and wait up to 5 minutes to get into a game3. join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server4. the map ends, everyone disconnects5. repeat steps 1-4 until you die of old age you might be thinking just go play on community servers! if by community servers you mean only 2fort/dustbowl then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. but for a game with 92 different maps spanning across 15 game modes, i think i'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there. there are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't i play on some of them? mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or amazing trade servers. i hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about 9 billion of them to choose from! i live on the east coast of america and mainly play at night. i can hardly ever find a match with 20 players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/2fort. this is unnacceptable. where the hell are all the 50k players at? competitive mode i don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. personally i believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had this mode added. this is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right? wrong. as far as i know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. plenty of time to polish some of its features up. but yet again, valve somehow managed to screw it up. no class restrictions, telephone number required or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards. no class restricitions is self explanatory. you can have about 6 engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but if you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue. the telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to valve? cough up that $10 buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club. now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve 130-damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update). last but not least, no real rewards. valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. they could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level 10 or even level 18. but instead, you get nothing. you upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot. in conclusion tldr this update sucks and i advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again this is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.",0

7541,"one of the most engaging mmorpg experiences out there. you never run out of things to do, but you don't feel burdened and guilty for not being productive because everything you do is productive. you can just go around mindlessly killing andand pillaging while enjoying some music for some hours and bang, you have made a lot of useful stuff to use later on. zero research, zero preparation, just go out there and kill stuff.some positive points about the game:- the game's depth varies with your mood and it remains fun. you can play light and casual, you can work the market, you can go hard and achieve great stuff...you can play it any way and still have fun.- graphics are pleasing, unless you really hate voxel stuff.- sound effects and ambience have a nice retro feeling.- market system is pretty straightforward, simple to use and efficient. not a lot of depth though.- you don't need to be anywhere, you can do everything you need without having to visit npc's.- classes are very unique and fun to play.- leveling is smooth.- you can have all classes without spending a single penny, you can switch classes as you please and the class is like a whole different character, with other equipment, and you level each class separately. same as having several characters, but without having to log off to switch between them.- you can be very stylish. the appearance of every equipment you loot is added to your collection, and then you can make your equipment look however you like.- you can build your place (pretty much like minecraft) within a predefined space called a cornerstone. you can spawn your home in any cornerstone you find here and there. why is this useful? intead of having to visit npc's, you build your own workshops and portals in your place and use them. plus, you get to show your friends your unique home! - it's fun to move around. you can glide, you can ride, your can skate on rails, you can sail, you can fly around sitting on a ing majestic rocket flying golden throne!- userbase has low toxicity (for an mmo).- game is light, highly optimized, runs great, looks good.- good servers, low latency and downtime.- high fantasy setting with a comic twist.- many quests to do. none of them feels grindy and they're really useful and rewarding.- the game is grindy in a way that it's doesn't make it feel so grindy. and you can always do some other stuff and have fun.- fantastic and very rewarding crafting system which is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp without being watered down or boring.- fun events.- responsive staff.- few bugs.- no need to partner up. just go out there. the game has a unique and seamless party system that rewards nearby players with exp and loot every time someone is killing, looting or completing a quest, and it will include a limited number among the nearest players. so just go out there, find people and smash stuff together without worrying or even knowing them, the games encourages that.- you can actually convince your normie and casual friends / family and actually enjoy it together, 'cause they won't have to understand much about the game to enjoy it. it can be fun in a superficial way, and is still fun when you get more into it and dive deep into it's systems.on the other hand, there are some negative aspects:- pvp is fun, but it's very far from being the center of attention. there are no open pvp areas in the wilds, there are no turf wars or factions, there are no big battles, there's not much reward in pvp in general. people very into pvp will probably hate it.- everything is too damn colorful. it's a matter of taste, really.- too many notifications.- lacks a minimap.- character building has little depth to it.- not much strategy involved, the game doesn't encourage you to join a clan, organize and make a plan to get things done, like killing a boss.- bgm could use some more tracks. it's always the same track for the same kind of place.- multiple jumping makes most dungeon designs totally pointless. they should at least remove that when you enter a dungeon, it feels like you're cheating and the feeling of accomplishment is overshadowed by the fact that you're basically jumping around mindlessly and ignoring mobs 99% of the time until you get to the dungeon's last chamber.- sometimes the camera acts like a when you're near walls, if you're in a small room or a narrow passage.- battlefield is a mess. sometimes too many mobs on one place, too many skills and explosions, always too many colors...very often you can't see- i feel that potions aren't the ideal approach to this game in particular. not sure what it could be though. maybe a new potion system, with craftable potions, recipes to collect, levels and different effects.- dungeons very often are generated in a odd way and you loose too much time trying to find the entrance.- classes are not balanced at all, for both pvp and pve. some will always stand out, while others are pretty much useless and not so fun to play.- they should add a proper dashing system so that you could move around more freely.- not a single class can fight while mounted, even the summoners and tamers. like wtf.",1

12011,"played for roughly 2 hours. the best part of this game is the character creation screen. though graphic wise it's pretty good looking that's where it ends. for whatever reason optimization is horrible. the game runs best on max settings then it does on lower settings. class wise the way to level up skills and chaining them isn't really explained too well. it's a learn as you go type thing. mounts have energy and if you run our you cannot mount till it recovers or you use an energy recovery potion. side quests aren't really explained what to do especially the gather ones where it doesn't even tell you where to gather the items at. i hit level 11 within those 2 hours and was on a main mission quest where you had to kill a level 1 elite ghoul. it will 1 shot you dealing 1400+ damgae to you which is unavoidable if you're melee. balance wise the game is a giant joke. you can 1 shot certain mobs and in return get 1 shot by mobs you must kill to progress the story mission quests. i also ran into a bug where by dying to that level 11 ghoul and selecting to spawn at the ghost instead of having to spend gems to respawn right where i was, i would fall through the world over and over again unless i was able to time running the instant my characters ghost touched the ground. all in all it's a sorry excuse for a game. i understand personally now why it has failed in every region it has ever come out in. on my honest opinion as someone who's been playing mmo's since 2002, don't bother with this one. let it die alone in a corner and go to something else. it's not worth the time.",0

10898,"i'm an ex mtg player. i played hearthstone for quite some time before moving onto other ccgs and i'm currently enjoying shadowverse. this review may come off extremely critical, but with so many f2p online ccgs to choose from, i feel it's warrented.your power (resource) cards are drawn from the same pile as your other cards. this leads to flooding and not getting enough power far too frequently. since this is a digital card game there are several better options and there is no need for this serious problem to occur. if they wanted to have players draw the power cards, they could have just made two seperate draw piles for resources and non-power cards and let the player choose what they want to draw to avoid this.going first has a large advantage. the only thing you get for going second is you draw first (firs player skips their initial draw). that's not enough to make up for being the player that's constantly reacting to your opponent's plays since you're basically a turn behind.some cards are obviously pushed too far. some cards have stats and abilities well above what they should have at their cost and are often put at higher rarity which makes them harder to obtain for new players. while some colors need these to be balanced compaired to the other colors, this is still at the very least a poor and lazy way to balance. eternal currently has no casual play, only ranked. why would it take so long to implament this very basic game mode? if you're fine with only playing ranked as i am, then it's a non-issue, however i know other players get anxiety when they play in ranked modes or just want a place to test things out and mess around when they don't feel up to playing ranked so i thought others should at least be aware.these next couple are just things i didn't like about eternal, but wouldn't call inherantly negative parts of the game.defender decides what is blocked and how the blocks occur. this leads to too many board stalls.damage is wiped from units at the end of the turn. again this leads to board stalls since you can't just chip down a big minion over time and you often won't want to attack with it either since your opponent can assign multiple blockers and kill it if it attacks.this game isn't all bad though, i did like being able to play against the ai to earn some chests (which contain cards). the drafting process was also well done. ui and art are decent enough.if you have no fast spells (cards that can be played on your opponent's turn) the game doesn't require an ok to progress the game which does help speed things up a bit. however if a player does have a fast spell, then the game requires you to push a button in between plays to progress. players should be able to quickly tell the time difference in between plays and know that you have a fast spell. this information can/will cause different plays vs. if the player didn't have that information.tl;dr there are better f2p ccgs for me. if you're looking for something closer to mtg than hearthstone, and the above issues don't bother you, then it's worth a shot.",0

1397,"honestly, this is one of the best f2p game that exist bar none. the grinds are not bad and the rewards are decent. the best part about this game are the developers which i have said about no other game ever. they read the forums and will react to feedback sometimes responding to your post directly. i have literally only had 2 issues with the game and after submitting a ticket they were resolved in less than 24 hours. the gameplay is good but not overly complicated. the graphics are good but again strike a good balance for my machine aka i can run everything on high but not ultra. this game is a great fit for me because i do not have a bunch of free time and just want to unwind for a couple of hours and get in a few co-op matches and snatch a few drop pods. so if you are a casual gamer who doesn't have a ton of free time i highly recommend you give it a spin. it is easy to learn but not so easy to master so there is depth. the maps look good, the ships look good the ai is decent. if you are more competitive it can accommodate that as well. the only thing holding this title back is it needs more players so install it and give it a try. if you like space combat/sci-fi then it will not disappoint.",1

2004,"so currently i only have around 24 hours and i am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.path of exile is fantastic. every steam owner should at one point or another try this game. however, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around 7 hours to get there (for me at least). this game is basically the paladins to diablo. personally i think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.art stylein act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. i personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act 3 being the nicest looking act thusfar. diablo i think should be a keymark for this. just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. poe is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. progressionok this is purely opinion based but i will try to be as objective as possible. diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. in this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. in poe it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. that being skills are merely items that you equip. this system allows for much more creativity but can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. in my personal opinion i think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. howeverpoe wins in the costumazation department purely because of the passive skill tree. holy crap. this skill tree. no barriers locked behind class walls. all classes can have any passive. that is so. refreshing. rarely ever do i see games do this and i still have no idea why. gameplaythis is an action rpg. meaning prepare yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. overall this is a must play. i intend to progress farther and play for engame content.",1

11003,"finally! eternal card game is the game wizards of the coast should have created 10 years ago. had wizards created an accessible, attractive and intuitive occg based on mtg, they would be the dominant player in the market going on a decade now. however, their short-sightedness and unwillingness to experiment with their ip means we had to wait for eternal to scratch our magic itch. (hex, while a beautiful and intricate game, lacks the 'accessible' and 'intuitive' aspects that hearthstone and eternal meet)+++ the gameplay in eternal is rock-solid, taking core ccg mechanics and tying them to colors similar to mtg. currently the colors are not as stratified as mtg, which allows for more versatile single color decks, while offering expanded options for multi-colored decks. eternal (after my 10 hours of play or so, so take it with a grain of salt) seems less focused on defining the metagame itself, unlike hearthstone (and to some extent mtg), where the meta (minus minor tweaking) is established within days of a new set coming out, largely by the developer. this is for 2 reasons; the core mechanics introduced in hearthstone expansions are usually the most efficient (jades, single-copy bombs like reno and kazakus, etc), and the limited card pool simply doesn't allow much experimentation. although i'm just starting with eternal it appears that there is a decent range of creature removal, larger creatures and the like in each color, along with some strong (but not 'forced') themes like echo and void-play.++ while eternal has a mana mechanic, it is automated. this means the game sets your mana curve for you, limiting your optimal mana ratios. however, i assume they did it to remove complexity from deck-building, which is a good thing when trying to bring in more casual players. the game offers a plethora of mana-fixing cards as well, in both colorless and colored cards, to allow better control of your mana-flow. so far, i've only been mana-hosed on a couple of occasions...in most games mana has tended to be plentiful, often to the point of excess (as my early games tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient decks).+++ eternal thankfully does away with the tiny card packs of hearthstone and hex and has 12 cards per pack, very close to the 14 (minus the land) in a mtg pack. at $1/pack, not counting the ability to draft, guantlet or forge for free cards/dust, the pack size/value ratio is exceptional compared to hex, mtgo and hearthstone.currently, the game modes available are gauntlet, forge, ranked and draft. as someone who likes to play mostly solo as i build a collection, the game modes are very close to perfect. gauntlet is a free pve constructed tournament mode and can be used to grind gold and some (usually common or uncommon) cards, with a perfect 7-win record earning a card pack as well. the ai modes seem well-designed to offer players good rewards as the player base could probably not accommodate pvp in each.forge is eternal's arena, a sealed-deck format where you build a deck from random sets of 3 cards; again, the game assigns your mana. it appears (though i've only played once (but did get a perfect 7 wins)) that once you have chosen 2 colors of cards, all remaining picks are of those 2 colors. this is a very nice feature and prevents someone from getting pretty far off-track into 5 colors (though i am certain there are some who would actually like that). arena's cost 2500 gold to enter; the 7-win run earned me 3500 gold, a couple of cards, and 4 card packs, so a little more than 3-1 value. you are allowed 2 losses before your run ends; as you are playing an ai, it seems this mode offers a pretty fair chance to hit 7 wins if you are good at sealed in ccg's. if the decks the ai is playing don't get more challenging as you rank up in forge, it should be pretty easy to go infinite.i've only played a few games of ranked, just enough to get a win for a quest, as i doubt i'm prepared to face constructed decks quite yet. the mode works fine, and even with only about 2k players online at any time, the matchmaking only took a little longer than hearthstone's. the 'casual' mode is currently offline, i am guessing until a larger player base means it won't cause extended queue times. i haven't drafted yet, but i will update my review when i do.overall, eternal is a great entry to the crowded online ccg market, and outside of hearthstone, might be the one to succeed with players who want something a little deeper than blizzard's game. the nitpicks i have with the game are minor...i think the art looks a little small on the play table (and i'm on a 27 monitor), though it is fine when zoomed in. as a once-upon-a-time competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness, i prefer a hearthstone-style consistently building mana pool. however, it's not a game-breaker and i haven't noticed it being as much of a problem as i had in my ptq-qualifier days. if you are a magic player that wants deeper mechanics, but still slicked-up hearthstone-style experience, eternal is your game.",1

10812,"this is a digital card game with the depth of magic and the polish of hearthstone. direwolf has hired on some of magic's best pros to help out with the card design and it really shows.this game uses mtg attacking and blocking, meaning it is easier to get a stalled board than hearthstone, but so far i've not had too many issues with it because there are lots of way to break stalls with combat tricks and other cards. you can play instants in this game, though they are called fast spells, and can only be played in response to a card being used on your units, during combat, and at the end of turn. this is actually very nice because it means you aren't f2ing through your opponent's turn. there are a few rng cards, though nothing nearly obscene as in hearthstone.this game has you put your mana, which is called power in this game, in your deck, like in magic. however colors are done through influence. once you get 1 of an influence of color, you can play any card that only has that influence requirement. so you don't have to worry about using the right color power. for players coming from hearthstone, the power system can be a sore point because you will come across times where you either draw too much power, or not enough power. you get a free mulligan each game. when you take a mulligan, you are stuck with what hand you draw. however after you mulligan, you are guaranteed to get at least two power in your hand. the free-to-play model is very generous. it follows the same pattern of hearthstone, but since each pack contains 12 cards, rather than 5, it makes it easier to get all the common and uncommon cards. also, drafting and forge let you keep the cards you choose, which let you build up your collection that way.all-in-all, i would say this is an excellent game and highly recommend that anyone try it.",1

(huge plus for me. no random, hard-work-destroying explosions)-sci-fi atmosphere (suck-arms instead of pickaxes and glowy machinery for crafting)-teleportation (makes life easy. you can recall to wherever you place your pad using the 't' shortcut or create a numbetr of teleporters you can step through and link together via a nifty little menu where you place items inside it to attune them to one another)-easy to navigate u.i. (very intuitive. bonus: almost all of the items you can interact with can be renamed) -dungeoning (plenty of monsters and dark pits to wander through with a torch, though the equipment selection feels a little sparce thus far)-it's now free to play. -did i mention it's free?so, yes, it draws a lot of inspiration from minecraft, but it's definitely not a carbon copy. definitely worth a play. creativerse is far from perfect, but i'm looking forward to what future updates hold.",1
3047,"the greed of these devs has always been impressive. they do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. at tier 4 and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.and worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. so once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.with ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.but of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.coming back to the game, i wanted to try out this new pve tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. the problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. and to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.on top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total a 1.0 rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. in air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have 2-3 times the weaponry. in ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. in naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0

7921,"i really like this game. i almost didn't bother with it after seeing such bad reviews. i realize that this is a free to play mmorpg. something a company thought of to give the public something to do with their time. these reviews sadden me because i feel like the people who wrote them were being truly ungrateful. some things you do need to buy but they give a lot of different items so you don't have to pay. you get a horse for crying out loud for 5 gold and a variety of companions for 2. some games that's completely impossible. you can get astral diamonds from the online gateway and you get nearly 10,000 a day for repeatable quest, plus you can sell any rare items to accumulate more astral. you can even get rare pets from events pretty easily. i recently got a flame sprite, and it's awesome, if you don't have 300,000+ in a month then it's probably not the games fault. it's probably yours because everyone has a life but the game gives you what you need to be successful. i haven't gotten to the higher levels yet but so far i've leveled up very easily with no problems. runestones are dropped left and right from any dungeon. i love the dungeons, i love how it's practically got a video game type interface. don't let the reviews make you turn away from this game. check it out yourself. if you like it fine, if you don't, that's fine too, but don't leave a nasty review making other people turn away because you can't get something you might want. i recently got a 3ds and i am thankful. i am not going to complain about how i have very limited games or about the color. going to be grateful the damn thing was free. not all games are for everyone but that doesn't mean it deserves such negativity that half of these reviews displayed.",1
11026,"this game is a lot of fun. it is rather generous for those who are free-to-play. one can amass a nice sum of cards quite painlessly. as far as card games go, this is in the same vein as magic: the gathering. i can't tell you how much i enjoy it simply for that alone. eternal actually has some depth to it, and skill comes into play much more often than rng does. perhaps best of all, you can try this game completely free and get plenty of cards to use in countless ways in various decks. it's really all up to your imagination, as far as deckbuilding goes. and even without tons of legendaries you can make any sort of homebrew deck that still has a competitive edge to it. not top-tier obviously, but still good enough to play competitively and, most importantly, have fun.that's the keyword here: fun. can you honestly say that hearthstone is still fun? look yourself in the mirror and try telling yourself that hearthstone is still fun. it's okay if you start crying. that only means the healing can finally begin.",1

18943,"seriously. i played the game off and on for a few months and i can definitely feel where people think the grind is. it felt like an endless loop of farming missions until you get lucky with your drops, wait 3+ days (unless you're willing to spend money, though at least the only crafting limit is time/resources, not some arbitrary you can only craft 2 things at a time) for some of those drops to craft into useable things then repeat. definitely burned out a time or two. finally progressed the story enough to get to the origin of the tenno and things like that, unlock some newer mission types, some warframes that actually warrant a significant change in playstyle, etc, and stuff suddenly got way better. it was still the same gameplay loop, but it just feels sometimes like the first chunk of the game is do the same 4 mission types on slightly different terrains, without a lot of context or relation to the story beyond these guys bad, tenno good. which might be my fault, i usually made sure a planet was as finished as possible before moving on and i probably could've hit the requirements for the junctions earlier than i did, but i also didn't realize that newer planets and areas did as much to progress/change the story as they did.",1

10771,"writing this review was not easy to me because i really wanted to like this game way much more... i was searching something less p2w feeling than hearstone and ecg was a good answer to that... playing ecg is fun and enjoyable, even if you need quite some grinding to reach a decent number of legendary cards for ladder ranking decks (that everybody use), there are plenty of option for solo or pvp playing and rewarding allows you to increase your collection over time.this game has an issue toh... and a big one. the way it handles mana is quite disturbing: mana flood or mana screw are so easly to happen that you find yourself loosing or winning a lot of matches just because that happens to you or to your opponent. while there are some mitigation you can put in your deck, this still a point that force you to rely more on your mana luck than in your actual deck composition. after a while this get to a point that the fun with the game fade away.the only deck that does not suffer of this too much is rakano aggro because you can basically play your entire deck with 3 or 4 mana which is easy to get...i bought a 50$ founder pack to suppor developers but this mana issue does not encourage me to invest more on the game nor spending my gems to buy cards that i would not be able to play because of mana issues.someone suggested to have two separate decks, one with mana cards and one with the rest. that seems a very good option to solve this issue but it looks unlucky they will ever implement this...",0

2631,was a good game at one point. it is mostly now a cash grab by the moneyhungry devs. if you want to play the game as a free to play it will take a very long time to unlock anything past tier 2 and 3-4-5 are imposible to unlock in a reasonable amount of time withought dropping money into it. now lets not forget the damage models of these planes. if you so much as breath on the wings they will break off. the control of the aircraft in arcade and realalistic arepoor infuriating at times. groundforrces are beond broken. ships dont seem that badf but it feels to little and to late in my oppinion. so if you are looking for a realalistic and well developed combat flight go to il-2. if you wanna goof of and around for a couple hours and dont care much about progresion. its probably for you.,0

5419,"i'm a wwii nerd so obvs i like this game, esp the wwii era of the tanks, you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc on the tanks, the way it was made, the reason why it was made etc, anyway personally blitz is much better vs world of tanks (the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it). blitz is a much faster pace, with less players on each side and a much smaller map. along with that theres no artys aka artillery which is blessed bc artillery is annoying. playing this game over the years on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement, i guess thats the term idk, anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference. whatever your better at controlling either holding a tablet or ipad, or just keyboard, personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while trying to shoot the enemy tank while trying to dodge, so you kinda panic ish but whatever. just depends your play style. no big issues with the game, lots of updates frequently not very bad, from time to time there are events or speical missions pretty cool tbh. currently most annoying thing has to be afk ppl, some i will say are afk others are not an afk issue, simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game, you load and don't load in until maybe 30 to 40 seconds after the game has started, pretty annoying. second most annoying thing is when ppl say oh your a pay to win buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too... even than whats worst is they run into open dies within the 1 min of when the game starts than blames on the team saying yall camping. personally i think once you start out playing this game, is kinda meh or boring etc, feels grindy bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc. tier 8 in my opinon has the most action all type of skill level, you have players that are new if they bought a tier 8 premuim tank (not really pay to win, bc each and every tank has a advantage/disadvantage against any other tank, along with that it depends on how you play and how your team is). for example, some players with heavy tank (powerful gun, strong armor, but slow speed), some players will literally sit in the back of the map -___- not saying you can't, but you really can't win the round if your gonna sit in the back and let your light tanks, medium tanks, or tank destroyer die, now not all are like that, some are very skilled, they're able to read on what they should do, shouldn't do against another tank, others *sigh* they yolo it as in push 4 tanks and die right in the open while shooting once and probably never hitting anyone or pen against them.obvsly you start off with low tier tanks when you start the game, but theres a reason, to teach you oh how the game will be etc, you have many nations that you can pick (usa, ussr, french, german, china, japan, or british tanks) each one of those has there own special perk or skill for example german tanks, very heavy armor with strong armor, same with the soviet tanks, the french however are less armored, but they have a mag shell or autoloader as in they reload maybe 17-20 seconds depending what tank, but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shells in less than 5 seconds, as in lets say the amx 50 100. you have 4 shells total in a mag, it takes 17? idk something around that seconds, but you can shoot 4 shells, you shoot once, than it takes 3.3 second to reload the next one and so on, until you shot all 4 than it reloads again with the full 17 seconds. very overpower in its own way, if you have the timing, but can be annoying bad in times as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depends. now the british tanks, very good, but they have one of the most if not most of all the tanks fires less than 7 to 9 seconds. which as you get to higher tier it gets annoying and you'd want to take the british tanks out first simply bc their gonna keep nailing you before you can even reload the next shot. however some tanks like the americans and japanese tanks, you wont really see much of japense tanks simply bc they kinda suck, however for american tanks you wont really see any tier 6 or 7 tanks, i hardly ever see any, simply bc every tank for any of the nation beats it. *cough* fix t20 bc its useless, but leads to the m48 patton which is very good, not only that looks good too. other than those tanks, you'll see a few tanks which don't look wwii era or stupid tanks however its nice to see different tanks instead of going against the same old tanks. overall for customization, does not look bad, very different from the other world of tanks, less things to add, but here the camos don't look as bad, they help you in the game, along with that i really look forward when they can create attachments for each tanks, like is3, is6 all the attachments looks sick, the american eagle looks great on some of the american tanks, but position very odd. kinda sucks that all tier 10 tanks have their own legendary skin and attachment. if wargaming can make it so the customization is same for both platforms on blitz and the normal orginal one, it'd be blessed.somethings to note about this game, there is rank, however not many ppl play it or atleast it takes awhile for me to get into a rank game. theres 2 modes, team deathmatch and supremacy mode (capture the flag, theres 3 or 4 depending on the map first to 1k points or to knock out the other tanks win). graphics aren't too bad, looks the same from my eyes on pc to mobile, sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max. bit annoying at times when fps drops but whatever. another thing, you won't be placed in a match in different regions, never had that happen, never really had bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi done you have good connection. replay is nice, you can sometimes learn from mistakes on what you did etc, by rewatching the matches that you played. ps it is not a pay to win game i haven't paid a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree, i only pay for the tanks that i really want aka lets say the scorpion, is a new tank that came out a couple of days, i had a dollar xd, was so stupid litterally just click and bam got it with 1%, ppl get salty bc you get it and they couldn't but whatever. anyway as i was saying only time you would pay is for getting more garage slots if you really want to keep every tank that you have gotten, ps you wouldn't really keep every tank, theres no point, just some tanks you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other, you instantly sell it xd. it just takes time to get enough xp for the next tank, not only that you need enough credits to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo, camo, gears etc many factors go in it. <--- also why people buy premium tanks is bc it gives good credits so that way you can grind faster. but you don't have to buy it you have a 1% chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crates every so day, week, so you have a chance.",1

8088,"disclaimer: im only doing pve content, so if youre in it for the pvp this review will not help you much.it seems the main point of concern for most people is if this is a pay to win mmo? technically it is not and as most reviewers have pointed out, you can go to max level without spending a dime, though it will take you longer without the xp boost and a faster mount. but if you dont feel the need to rush to the end you will get at 80+ hours of free rpg mmo play time. at max level spending money becomes a real option especially if you want to be more competitive in pvp or do tougher dungeons and dont want to spend all your time grinding out astral diamonds.the good:1)the neverwinter gateway web site and cell phone app is a cool feature. often when im away from my computer i will open the app on my phone and assign a task to one or more of my professional assets or play a round of sword coast adventures dice game to level companions.2)graphics are decent.3)even though you have tons of powers you are limited on how many you can have on your hotkeys which cuts down on the number of buttons you have to press in a battle. yes i think this is a good thing, or at least it is for me.4)the quest tracking. i like the sparkle trail on the ground that leads you to your quest area and back, but it can be turned off if you hate it.5)nearly 100% voiced dialogs, including quest.6)this may not be for everyone but i like the private instanced mini dungeons you get from quest, of course you can also join up with a friend and complete them together if you wanted.7)user created content, this can be a crap shoot but there is some damn fun ones out there.the not so good:1)not an open world mmo. i know this is not a big deal but i just keep feeling like im missing something and i hate run into invisible walls in outdoor zones.2)no way to open the tyrannical lockboxchest you pick up everywhere without spending real money to buy keys. there is nothing in them that is required to play the game and if you have enough astral diamonds you can often find the items from the chest in the auction house.3)too many types of currency in the game! money (normal game currency), zen, glory, companion upgrade tokens, astral diamonds, ardent coin, celestial coin, and black ice. that doesnt count the other 20+ types of currency you get from quest areas, seasonal events and some chest. i know they are doing this to make the game more detailed but i find it a pain to keep track of them all and find myself going back to old quest areas to see what i can buy with them. at less they dont take up bag space!4)can be very hard to resist speeding money, for me it is mainly to gamble on those lockboxchest, come on, baby needs a new pair of shoes, damn snake eyes.5)limited bag space at lower levels. i run out of space on almost every quest but i dont have a full set of the biggest bags as they cost either 1,000 zen (~$10) or 300k+ astral diamonds which takes a lot of time to gather.so in the end my personal opinion is that it is a decent mmo and can be fun to play. but will i play it for hundreds of hours? i doubt it. im guessing i will finish to level 60 on my main toon and possibly test another class out but not a full level up, then move on to another game. there are way too many ftp mmos out there to get stuck in one.for full disclosure: i have spent some real money in the game to get a bigger bag and a faster mount. but i feel im getting my moneys worth and im supporting the company as someone has to pay the developers and keep the lights on.",1
12971,"tl;dr - fallout shelter is fun for what it is - a quick diversion while you drop the kids off at the pool, or when things are slow at work, etc. i played the game on my phone for a couple weeks and maxed out my dwellers and rooms, and so forth. opinions and things of note from my playthrough:it's a pseudo-strategy upgrade'em up, vault-building farmville-like game that is also reminiscent of sim tower. the comic art-style is well executed with cutesy and fun animations and effects which the dwellers exhibit while carrying out their lives.bonerkill alert: grabbing and dragging dwellers is awkward and inaccurate, even on pc, especially when zoomed out -> grabbing them accurately requires zooming in, but moving them to where they need to go often requires zooming out again.double bonerkill alert: the emphasis on microtransactions in fallout shelter are disappointing, although not unexpected considering the original platform and target audience.entitled gamer conclusion: it's unfortunate that bethesda used their time and effort, and this great ip to make a weak mark on it's legacy. i think i speak for many fans when i say we would have been happier to pay outright for a more serious entry for mobile platforms, perhaps something along the lines of fallout/ii/tactics.",0

13595,"i payed 15$ for terraria, and sometimes played minecraft on my cousins ipad. neither of them are as incredible as creativerse (edit: the full experience is more expensive.) . see, i wasnt all that big a fan of minecraft. and as much as i liked the game terraria, it got boring fast. thats why creativerse is better: even doing the same stuff doesnt get boring. (edit: i didn't try farming @.@) yeah i can slaughter all the enemies, but im also able to tame them and harvest them peacefully. you can wack stuff with a sickle or hoe, or you could farm with lazors!!! or mine with lazors!!!

(heavy sarcasm is heavy)2.the price. it's 20$. i understand it's for the developers, but i bought fallout 3 for like 14$. fallout new vegas for like 12$ or something. both of these games are alot bigger, have more hours playable, and are alot more polished. and you say that creativerse is 5-10 dollars better, for a jetpack, flashlight, and inventory. just come to your own conclusion on that.pros:-incredibally fun-creative designs (especially the rock golem guys. they are cool.) edit: wish there was more monsters.-the bugs are hilarious. seriously, dont fix the bomb jump!

(mind you apollo is not even a default god, and you need a currency called 'gems' to buy gods in this game) (there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money...) so, after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods ao kuang thanatos and guess who get again? yep, you guessed it. apollo. i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that, but to top it off ao kuang and thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and there's no way to escape it, you just instantly die... and it heals ao kuang and then he can fly away and do even more damage, so after my teammate got eaten by an ao kuang, which then landed on me killing me? i just uninstalled. (((none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money) oh yeah, and before i even started playing, there's some gods they released that they didn't even finish, causing massive balance issues. such as hel, artio, and ullr, they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game. if hi-rez fixes these things, i will make my review positive, but as if now i can not reccomend this game.tl;dr: pay to win game with no updates since 2014 after devs abandoned the game, dead community, and extreme balance issues.",0

2116,"this is my absolute favorite arpg to play. i loved diablo 2. this game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique diablo 2 / titan quest arpg. the rng is real, the challanges are fun. the content doesn't get dull. progression is limitless. knowledge is never ending. mechanics are so well done. the skills in this game are interesting. the ability to make any build you want is just simply the greatest. my cons: poor optimization, an ssd and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable fps.the highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. it's doable but likely expensive for solo players. not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.there is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. the lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't gamebreaking unless you have a bad pc.overall, if you've never played an aprg like this before, it make come off as too hard. the hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. what items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. all of this stuff simply takes time to understand. i've played this game since closed beta, on and off. i learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.this game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. this game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. this game is super competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.the content updates are constant, the gaming company, grinding gear games are simply the best of the best. on par with valve and sorta kinda blizzard-8-years-ago. there are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.if you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. but you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. this is always the biggest issue i see with new players. this is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to diablo 3. it isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.if you're my friend, hit me up, i will do everything i can to make you realize this game. it's fun, i love it. oh and it's 100% free to play. there is no pay to win. extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. that said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab. but it does make life easier.",1

16811,it's a pretty alright game where you could pass time when played with the right people. although there are more tweaks stilll needed as the game is still a beta version. but overall it won't disappoint those who are looking for a game to mess around with some friends take advantage of how broken the games is.,1
1724,this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. the reason i choose dota over lol is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. i hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health lol. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.,1

11626,"freestyle2 is a free to play mmo basketball game which is both awesome and nerve-wracking at times. first, i'll get into the positives and then i'll rant about the major issues.to begin with, it's a street basketball, thus, it's played on one basket, there are no fouls, no free throws, etc. matches last 5 minutes, they have overtimes and replays. i won't be going into the details about the basketball itself because it's self-explanatory. next, in order to jump into the match, you must pick a position and create a character which is customizable to an extent. then you'll be launched into a really confusing lobby screen with tons of options. you'll notice card sets, toys (mascots), sh*tload of events and so on. next, there's training mode which is essential for a newbie. you'll get a chance to practice every ability of your chosen position. those skills, if not yet acquired, will be available to buy in skill shop as you level up. for more flashy moves you can try equipping freestyles.my problem with this game is that there are a lot of microtransactions which affect your stats and gameplay. you can get stuff like new characters with additional skill points, buffed items and other stuff which increases your abilities and gives you an advantage. though, it's possible to get them without spending real money but it's pretty tough to do so and only available during certain events.furthermore, there are many bugs, crashes, freezes and connection stability issues and they show up pretty often and haven't been fixed for too god damn long. besides, many people state that there's a bitcoin miner inside the game files.. that's a first.tl;drpros: fun gameplay addictive challenging a wide choice of clothes, accessories, cards, toys, skills, freestyle, etc non-stop events great and fitting musiccons: slightly pay2win many bugs, crashes, freezes, connection issues bitcoin miner inside the game unchangeable character appearance except for clothes, accessories and hair salty communityoverall, this game is so fun and competitive but also has so many problems that prevent me from giving this game a 10 9/10",1
8831,"no longer a must see! updated to remove options.bland, nondescript, time to play fortnite!with any game an update will please some and displease others but the jury is out on this update.what was a clever and interesting twist on the latest rage of battle royale games, has stripped back everything that made it unique and clever and left behind a mere relic.not only has the class system (with class weaponry) been removed. now you get forced into a random skin of a character regardless of what you might like.what is far more annoying is the developers have decided which weapons you should able to play with, meaning that often in games i find only secondary weapons and am not allowed to run 2 of them. no longer are you able to run an heirloom rifle and shotgun, or burst rifle and pistol. at the crafting forges you have no choice over what is produced, you simply say create gear and you might get something useful or waste your time.instead of 2 abilities that were difficult enough to choose from the selection, you now have only one, again limiting your options.movement abilities are now something that needs to be collected but some previously normal abilities are classed as these, so again you cannot run roll and withdraw as the devs have decided for you: there is no reason to want to engage and then run away! either you want to go in or be a scaredy cat, there is no room for anyone in betweeni have been pushing people to play with me, but with this update it's uninstalled and i really wish i hadn't wasted any money supporting them.",0

(both which come with the pro account) i played a while without it but decided to upgrade to help support the game.as people have said, creativerse is a lot like minecraft. it's also a lot more though. instead of crafting normal tools such as a pickaxe or an axe you make cells. each one helps you dig further and further into the ground until you come to the final layer.you unlock recepie's by crafting other items. (make a wooden fence and you unlock wooden gate and stone fence for example.)instead of cows, pigs and sheep you have weird monster like creatures that you can tame. once you feed them they will produce items which you harvest with your cell. then you must bathe them. rinse and repeat.of course, like many newer games there are a few bugs. you need to keep your tamed monsters in the stay position. if you let them wander they may dissappear for good.i would give this game an 8.5 out of ten. i look foreward to more updates in the future.",1

2989,"at it current state(1.81) is to expensive to play the game, if you don't have premium account you can't progress at all because of the repair cost and even if you do have you can't make mistakes if you want to have enough silver lions to buy another vehicle, stock vehicle are the worst, planes isn't that much but you still can feel a difference, the big problem here are mainly tanks were if you don't have repairs and fpe(extinguisher) you are useless if they get any of the parts of the tank unless you get to the capture point to repair (if they get your engine you can't do anything), matchmaking is too compressed so sometimes you get games where your tank or your plane lacks too much compared to others and still with the compression takes some time to get into battle depending on your rank(if you don't get a small game with 6-8 people, wich are decided on the first 3min of the game), this game have become a p2w or even worst than that because at it current state premium isn't helping that much, a premium vehicle and account are a must if you want to grind anything or even play(keep in mind that you can only reasearch vehicles of the same nation that your premium vehicle is), can't recommend this game at all anymore if you want to have fun and even spend money into something i would recommend world of tanks(warships or planes) those games aren't perfect too, but are in a better state or even buy a game from steam that will be better.",0
935,"i was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):my opinion: solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad. if played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. if you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. the devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game. the negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. but really my negatives are limited to that and i do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions. i suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. but when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. a lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. if anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so i find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. if i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what i see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. this isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect. since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.microtransactions: limited to skins essentially, you can't simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. there is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1

7890,"hands down one of the best free mmos i have ever played. the game is not the most gorgeous, but it looks good. the game is not incredibly complex, but it has an intricate balance. i really enjoyed my time in the game... and even outside of it.the dynamic of playing the game from a browser with my companions is brilliant. the fact that i can craft from the same browser is amazing! if they had an app that did something similar, i'd almost pay a small monthly fee for it. the companion system by itself is actually pretty awesome. someone to hang out with you and support or tank or fill whatever gap you have is pretty awesome. while some of them could stand to be a little better, they are pretty good overall and the ones at the beginning of the game are very helpful. my favorite part, however, is the user created content. the ability to run a dungeon created by another player is amazing. i've run some good ones and bad ones, but that feature is awesome! when i say dungeon, it does it a bit of dis-service. it is more like an entire zone built with encounters, buildings, bosses and loot tables that plays out as a full quest or mission. some of them can be done in 10 or 20 minutes, while others may take more than hour. the difficulty is also variable.the micro-transactions for this game can get pricey, but i didn't worry too much about them. they have some interesting packs and people who plan to invest a lot of time can easily wait until a sale and get a great deal. imo, the game is good enough to at least invest a little bit.",1

5874,"being a long time flight simmer i'm really happy about how dcs world brings flight and air combat to our pc screens. great flight sim with a lot of attention to detail. the world is beautifully rendered with lots of, hills, valleys, towns, cities, rivers and thousands of trees all over the landscape. aircraft are beatutifully rendered inside and out, they sound thunderous and the flight physics feel pretty accurate to me. mind you, to my disgust i've never had the chance to fly around like a excited wide eyed lunatic in an f-15 or an a-10 but aircraft feel responsive to a host of factors in the air from cross winds, to the weight of your loadout, temperature, altitude etc. honestly a lot of the time i have a great time just flying around enjoying the sensation of flight. sim does have a pretty steep learning curve and will take some time to learn each aircraft and it's systems. modules can be expensive but its best you chose an aircraft you want to learn and master it as each aircraft functions fundamentaly differnt. i would treat each full price module has it's own simulator. there are cheaper modules available as well that are not as expensive or as detailed that will still give you a pretty awesome flying experience for a fraction of the price. i will definatly say that this is not a casual game. i see lots of reviews from people saying wtf i coudln't even make it off the ground etc. its really recommended you rtfm or seek out some tutorials. i would also recommend some form of hotas setup for the best experience. more content is being added frequently, i'm particulary looking forward to dcs 2.0 going live, which includes las vegas / nellis afb and red flag campaigns, as well as the addition to the release of the f/a-18.lastly, performance wise dcs is pretty cpu intensive. if you have a decent cpu, you will certainly get better performance. though some easy ways to boost performance is to decrease water detail and civillion traffic ( streets are populated with scores of moving vehicles and trains) there are also guides out there for other ways to tweak performance.",1

is this game making me laugh? how many funny moments i can remember about this game? is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <2kh scum n00b)? the answers to the questions were: no, no, not even 10, i don't know. in that instant, i realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. how many times have i actually enjoyed what was going on screen? why am i taking this so seriously? why do i want to win so desperately? why do my teammates want to win so desperately?...how many times have i smiled while playing this game?...these are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! this makes me sad. i've heard yelling my whole life, i play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. games really help me, they help me a lot. please, guys, stop, dont get mad, im serious! this is a game, right?

wasn't that fun? remember pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? and then the radiants team wiped us? yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? sorta fun?

15246,"blatantly rigged. there are times where you do either extremely good or insanely bad, there's never an in-between.it's as if the game decides who's gonna win based on some hidden algorithm, then makes all his opponents land on his tiles meanwhile the preselected winner lands on his cities, empty tiles or chance tiles.oh and if it's your turn to lose, good luck with that. the dice rolls do their best to make you land on the tiles with the highest rent, and if you land on chance, 90% of the cards will be bad such as the one that makes you land directly to the city with championship.if you start last that's a red flag that the match will be rigged against you, so don't even bother.this has happened so many times that calling it a coincidence would be pretty naive.",0

1920,"ok so its dota 2, the larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing, if you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer. you will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not? from a graphics point of view at maxed out on a gtx 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget pc with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *wooden pc* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and i bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst gpu's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace.from a gameplay point of view, as you can see i have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above, the reason?well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. so 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100+ heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like really know it. how to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. so in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging.the community: this is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an english or us server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (i will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you.the ranking system and how valve makes its money: so the game is free and so how does valve make its money? well first let me explain the ranking system: basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (i think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which i find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. these costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a cv.also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your mmr with the top mmr being 7500 and bottom 0 (you really have to be bad to get 0) with 5000+ mmr being very high. mmr is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, 2000-2700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.this concludes my review for dota with a few 10/10 statisticsalso please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players: 8.5/10gameplay: 9/10community: 6/10 as it gets better later onranking/progression system: 9/10",1

4192,"if you played and/or play the normal yu-gi-oh card game, i do not recommend this. its a sad immitation. don't get me wrong its oddly enjoyable, i mean i put in 6 hours into it, and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then 30 minutes, but its not something i can take seriously.cons:first, they cut the game in half, which means, half the deck size, half the hp, half the time, and half the cards on the field. biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that, so that means you have cards the ask for 5000 hp and combo cards like exodia that are useless.the game forces you through a progression system, that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction. i understand explaining a game to someone, but anything bellow level 40 is no challenge at all, and thats with a halfdeck. to give example of how bad it is, level 20 and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss, and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long. the ai is super simple. now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage 6 to even play against players. just to clarify what i mean by no challenge, is the enemy does not place spell or trap, and nothing above crappy regular 3 stars, which can be easily out done with one of your first cards.last thing i have to say, is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical chinese knockoff, they put in a attempt, tried to cut corners, and it turned out likepros(yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it):matches are fast, so you can enjoy a few during a break.its more portable, so yu-gi-oh on the go.less money to get a insane amount of cards.good way to try new cards, and card combos.they implement a auto-duel feature, making the boring duels shorter, more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck.voice actors from the anime.",0

5137,"tl;dr:it's a great game already. if you like the kind of combat you find in smash, if you like shiny ranks, and if you like nice streamers, then this is for you!pros:- it's not a traditional combo-based fighter. anyone familiar with smash bros will feel right at home.- the attacks feel very satisfying. the controls are super smooth too.- dare i say it? yeah, i do: items feel very balanced in this game. none of this fox only no items final destination stuff.- you pick up one of two character specific weapons that alter your moveset (you drop 'em if you get wrecked).- the weapons spawning randomly on the battlefield opens up for quake-like weapon denying, which is pretty fun, both as the guy trying to outmaneuver the guy with the pointy rocket-stick and said rocket-stick guy who's got a scrub to turn into a pincushion (they spawn rather regularly, so dying once wont end the game for you).- you can throw your weapon. and it feels so satisfying to toss a spear in someones face and then grab it into a combo. - i'll actually put in another pro just for throwing. did i mention it feels satisfying?- it has a training mode that displays hitboxes and hurtboxes clear as day. it makes practicing easy.- there is a cash shop, but it contains cosmetics only. - extremely polished for an early access title. this is what early access should be like.cons:- only one server, and its in the us. playing fighting games online with 150< ms is not particularly entertaining (hopefully us europoors will get our grubby mitts on one of our own soon enough). now is the time eurobros- the health circles at the top right is a bit far off. one glance up there to gauge everyones health could be your unfortunate end. (if you put it at the bottom of the screen like smash does that'd be swell. i wont tell nintendo)- the hardest cpu setting in training is nowhere near a player in terms of difficulty.- the announcer pronounces bdvars name as bodvar. now keep in mind folks, this game is compared a lot to smash but it is its own game. its probably not going to be completely similar to smash bros, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic game. now if the developers of this game happens to be reading this:thank you for being the first to make a game like this for pc! i bought the collectors pack and i'll try my best to prove to you that there is a market for this kind of game by forcing friends to do the same at gunpoint. i hope you will continue working hard on this great game.i'd give this game an 8/10, and its probably gonna be my 9 or even 10 after it goes out of beta.",1

4558,"this review is for those who are already familiar with mobas and have played dota 2 or league of legends. i will point out what makes smite unique compared to those games.- third person camera perspective. unlike the classics, smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character. this allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability. - (almost) every ability in the game has to be aimed, including melee and ranged basic attacks! that's right, if you want to play the ad carry in smite, prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can't land your basic attacks. same goes for everything else: if you can't hit your abilities reliably, you will not succeed, there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed. from the other perspective, this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations. many times i was one hit away from death, but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements, i survived. - playable characters (heroes, champions) in smite are real gods from pantheons that were once (and some still are) worshipped. norse, roman, mayan, hindu, chinese, greek. play as zeus, thor, odin, loki and many other gods and mythical creatures. hirez studios does a (mostly) great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable characters. and for those deities you don't know, there is always a lore section for every god, so you even learn something about different cultures while you play. yay, knowledge!- 5 different game modes + one that changes every day. unlike its competitors, smite features many different game modes aside from the classical 5vs5 (here called conquest). arena (5vs5, no lanes, team deathmatch), siege (4vs4, two lanes, small jungle), joust (3vs3, 1 lane, small jungle), assault (5vs5, all random all mid, 1 lane). the mode of the day changes every day and features fun setups (like 5vs5 on the assault map and everyone get's the same god).all of these game modes have their own, detailed and well crafted map. in conquest mount olympus opposes a vulcano, in arena you fight in a grand colloseum, in assault you defend the halls of asgard from the forces of chaos, in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforests and in joust you're a knight for some reason (it will be changed to a chinese themed map soon). in addition to that, smite features one of the best deals in a free to play game: the god pack. the god pack costs 30$ and contains every god currently in the game. owners of the god pack also receive the newest god as soon as they're released. forever. that means, the more gods join the battle of smite, the more value you get for your 30$. you do the math. why should you play smite over league or dota? if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas, but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones, smite will be the game for you. it's highly skill-based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional mobas do not have. i played league of legends for 4 years, but after i got athritis (this is a joke) from playing adc and kiting for too long, i gave up. for me, smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional mobas never did. i will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about smite, i am not delusional:many skins in smite are locked behind chests, which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them, you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want. it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god is announced, only to later find out it's in a chest with 56 other items. hirez abuses this a bit too much. though we have the god pack, so that balances it out.eu servers can be very unreliable. quality control at hirez is either non-existent or very bad. some new gods release in a pitiful state, either balance or design-wise. they have horrid animations, amateur-like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered. some god designs are also very questionable. sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their lore, or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense. did you know the spartans put the statues of ares, the god of war, in chains to restrain him? yeah, that's cool, but only a small footnote in his lore. well, what hirez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact. he shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield. the shield has a demonic visage on it, where the fire comes out. does that sound like the greek god of war to you? not to me. but these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience. i've been playing this game for more than a year, and only looking forward. it's free in the end, so why not try it out and look for yourself?",1

8976,"downloaded it a couple days ago, played 16 hours straight, it's very smooth, addicting and huge mmofps, it isn't just a fps, the game works a lot like real war, infantry need air support and tank support to take locations, in total they're hundreds of locations to take, faction choices are more preference based then gameplay changing based, you get some different looking stuff and some factions have better stats towards items that there faction is advertised to be.you cannot log into this game as an experienced fps player and expect to go 40/5 score's like you might in cod or other related games, this game is about teamplay and stratergy, they're 6 different unit types all of which can counter or push or '' sneak '' the enemy to help your team/group/unit/outfit (clan)/faction take an objective.i still don't fully understand the game which is a surprise since i'm one of those kind of 40/5 players when it comes to fps games on the pc, however this isn't a game where you call people noob or get godly scores, infact most people don't get good scores, the game says you can die a hundred different ways and it's practically true, the game is about the real-war vibe, soldiers attacking objectives, dying over and over until air and tank support finally take over.sound: 9/10 - very realistic and immersive, makes you feel like you're in an actual war with the lights off :pgameplay: 10/10 - can feel unfair at times, but the over-all goal and experienced is more then achieved by the game.combat: 8/10 - again can occasionally feel unfair but not unabalanced, luck can help as-well as group play.air combat: - 11/10 - so realistic and responsive, requires a lot of learning and practice to dominate.tanks/etc - 9/10 very realistic but can't be effectively fired using third person, shutting you down from your surroundingpay2win? - this game is free to play, some guns are  cash only but a lot of guns are in-game credits, you will find yourself somewhat grinding here, i was only able to unlock some gun attatchments and upgrades after 16 hours of gameplay, however the '' beginner '' guns are very good, they're not made crap to force you into buying, you could happily and easily use all the beginner items forever and be a good player, however i feel some cash guns do offer advantages but it's strange, the pace at which someone can die is never changed by the gun, some guns just assist the person, meaning if you're a good fps player it won't matter, if you're a new fps player or a bad one, you will often find yourself over-powered by cash users, over-all not anywhere close to p2w.- ps, the sniper unit can cloak small vehicles and fire from them whilst remaining cloaked, sniper units can also use some rifles, being stealthed with a rifle for me is a broken aspect of this game and one i do not enjoy or support.- sniping, it's nothing like call of duty or other fps games so if you're a quickscoping fanboy don't bother with this game, sniping is very realistic, you have to aim where your opponent will be, bullet travel time and distance vastly affects your aim, also most beginner snipers do not one shot unless headshot, but do lot's of high damage, which is how it should be, like air combat, sniping actually requires practice.over-all rating: 9/10 - completely free to play, no hackers that are overkilling the game, lots of stratergy, groups and action, not pay2win, addictive and balanced, feels like cod + battlefield, best of both worlds, with slightly less graphics compared to say battlefield, i'd say on max settings this makes any cod game look '' simular ''.graphics: i have a msi nvidia gtx 970 over-clocked at maximum overclock and i get 100-120 fps with very high settings in fights of 1-12 or 12-24, i get about 60-80 fps in fights of 24-48 and 60-70 in fights of 48-96 and 96+the textures of the game are somewhat '' ugly '' compared to other games, but this is often misunderstood as a bad thing, you have to load about 30-400 players in one somewhat small objective area at one given time, including the sky, the tanks and turrets, mines, the map itself, the rocks and map design and fillers including helicopters etc all moving at once, i feel the textures are bad for a reason, the game is unplayable on any standard/none gaming gpu, (amd/nvidia) is required at atleast about 70+ per gpu (2 gpu's) or 200+ for one gpu to run the game at an eye pleasing level.",1

11944,purchased founders due to a lot of the promises that came from the dev and emissaries around what they were going to do differently in this region. none of these promises were true. you basically have emissaries who are either fanboys/liars and people now who know the truth and are speaking up about it. i thought it was very odd they were not doing a beta event or any sort of testing in this region and this is why.performance is abysmal on 1700x and vega 64 gets sometimes 15 fps in towns and can barely reach 60 other times. translation is horrendous and you are going to have no idea what your moves do. this is nothing more than a cash grab don't do it and stay with another mmo. i appreciate steam for honoring the refund for a broken game and the devs lieing to the players.,0

8261,"note: the review has been updated to include the campaigns content.neverwinter is an mmo by perfect world entertainment. this allows us to predict two things:1. the amount of cash required will be huge.2. the classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual d&d races, and have a choice of class. this confirms suspicion in that there is the devout cleric (healer) guardian fighter (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).you'll have an option between the control wizard which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very squishy. the main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.the great weapons fighter which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. standard front-line damage-dealer. this class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.the trickster rogue who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. this class's main job is to kill the bosses.the hunter ranger who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. the hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. the skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.combat is simple in this game: you have two at will attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.you then have three encounter skills, which are basically active skills. mapped to qer by default.lastly, you have a daily power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of action points which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and i assume tanks block or absorb damage (though i haven't made one to confirm it). these could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to 1 and 2 by default.there's the feat system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.and then there's the two active passives slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not feats (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.you can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.equipment is your standard mmo system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):-white common basic equipment.-green uncommon equipment.-blue rare equipment.-purple epic equipment.-orange (?).purple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level 60 dungeons, while tier 2 is obtained from more difficult level 60 dungeons.so far, so standard. where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in diablo), and those have several ranks. you can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a 1% success rate at level 8 (rank 10 is the highest).if you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.well, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.i should probably mention the artifact system. these are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. the primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.each player gets one at level 21 in a bind on equip state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. this bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.the game features a companion system. free players get a white one, which can reach rank 15 (equivalent to player level 30). for 25$, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank 30 (equivalent to player level 60).bag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. the large bag costs (24 slots) 10$.storage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.pvp exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.one-hit-kills are fairly frequent.story-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear r.a. salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. the entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.the writing is what you can expect from salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of satan and hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).the campaigns which i mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require astral diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.unfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to pvp.and, of course, i saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called astral diamonds. you receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in pvp) in a rough form, and must refine them in order to use them. the currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.astral diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).now, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. it costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. that is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. you can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.to top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous perfect world entertainment support is just worthless.so, over-all, would i recommand this game?well, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.otherwise, no, i'm afraid i can't recommand it.",0

2389,"this game is pretty good. i've been playing diablo since it came out, and path of exile just blew my mind at first. the ammount of costumization compared to diablo is insane. true classic hardcore gameplay in which you can do whatever you want with your class of choice. itemization and gem system are also insanely customizable. it's like a dream come true for someone that have been in a cage (diablo 3) for some years. huge amount of little mechanics that keeps your head busy for a long time while you're playing the story. also at this point there's already much more story content: 10 acts with incredibly varied storylines and distinct artstyle for each world region. i love diablo but poe is on a whole another level entirely. this is easily the new standard of modern arpg. now for the cons:- huge letdown is that microtransactions are way too effin expensive, if you're outside us. they've simply converted their dlc store from us dollars to whatever currency it's used in your country, so if my currency is like 1:4 usd, i'm f-ed. a set of skin in this game is worth more than 1 month minimum wage salary here. i don't care about skins but other stuff are needed to play this game confortably, like stash tabs. i can't take this game seriously if i know i won't be able to keep my sanity in the long term. the game is good, but food and housing comes first.- trade system is archaic, to say the least. i know they're trying to replicate diablo 2 nostalgia here, but its a process that aged very poorly. the game absolutely need an in game full fledged market system. i'm glad there's any trade at all, but i often want to quit the game just because trading is so cumbersome. you have to pm people, hope that they're online and wait for replies that almost never come.",1

2374,"poe is the perfect example of rng done very wrong, even for an arpg.i still play for a little while after each expansion, but i always quit for months at a time waiting for the next, because they never fix the biggest problems with the core game.i only recommend it if you enjoy mindlessly grinding the same stale content for hundreds of hours to brute-force abysmal rng while making no meaningful progress.this game has the potential to be amazing, but ggg's stubbornness about insane rng-gated design coupled with the mentally ill community crying when somebody has too much fun will not let that potential be met.progression is a chore. a ton of builds are not viable as the game continues to be balanced around the top 0.01% that have absolutely no life with min-maxed everything. crafting gear you want is borderline impossible. level 100 items can still get level 1 roll tiers. countless build-enabling unique items are very inaccessible. respeccing your passive skills is very expensive and this is exactly the kind of game where you want to be experimenting as much as possible with the passive tree. trading is inconvenient and all manual. most endgame content is gated behind pure rng. no damage numbers, death logs or recaps in any way, which makes understanding what's going on significantly harder. inconsistent enemy balance. extremely overpriced mtx with no way to refund or trade in to get points back. it's impressive that ggg is able to put out big updates every few months, but they never fix the numerous core issues with the game, or they make them worse by balancing around no-life players. i could write a novel about what's wrong with this game from a design standpoint, but that's just more time wasted to poe. if you want to do any endgame content without wasting countless hours, you'll most likely have to buy your way to it, which isn't how it should be designed at all. good luck getting anything done in ssf.it's free(except for stash tabs that are absolutely necessary), that's great, but if you want to slave away on boring tasks, you can go get a job that pays you to do that, then you can buy more engaging games.",0

5339,"i've been playing the world of tanks series of games (started out with normal world of tanks for the pc, calling wotm for now) for almost 6 years, and wotb is quite a fun replacment. i lost my interest in wotm because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, i used the arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but i am skeptical), and when i was watching videos on wotb, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and i desided to try it out, and i found it to be quite fun, and i have been playing it non-stop ever sense. pros: smaller matches compaired to wotm means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. new equipment system: many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. and i will say, at first, i absolutly hated it. the new system allows players to mount 9 different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for spare parts. many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind igc (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount 3 equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier 5 tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the gun stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier 8+ tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:there are tons of tanks in here, just like wotm, bar arty. if you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. if you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. if you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for tank destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. and as the game is still improving just like wotm, more tanks are in the future. good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as hd as wotm, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but i am not into games for fancy graphics, i play for gameplay.cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.cons:smaller matches compaired to wotm. although it has it's perks, if you come from wotm, you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the 7 v 7.spare parts system: although the new equipment system is good, i will say that the spare parts system is somewhat flawed. we should at least earn 1000 spare parts for a victory and maybe 250 for a loss. i've only won about 300 for a victory. this makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. the only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every 12-24 hours (forgot which lol) to be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - update 3.10 claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. overpowered tanks: although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a tiger ii in real life would blow away a sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. some notable tanks are the leopard light tank of tier 5, kv-2 of tier 6, lttb of tier 7 to name a few. what makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the leopard only had 2 varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. the kv-2 in game can 1 shot anything at tier 6 and below when using the 152mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. lttb reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. the lttb is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has 90mm of hull armor. i don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) however, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. kv-2 has an insanely long reload (upwords of 20+ seconds), and the lttb is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.there is also somewhat of a russian bias with this game, and many of the russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the german tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the german tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. and yes, i am parcial to german tanks, but i also use british, american, and russian, so this is from personal experience. the new millitary honor system:absolute *** in my eyes. i've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and i don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily i might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of this new millitary honor system, you're honor stars go down because random players think you're botting, or afking when you could have issues like i am experiencing. in my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. and my final and main issue with the game: no three man platoons like normal wotm - i understand that 7 v 7 might be difficult to have 3 man platoons, but we need something cause 2 man platoons is just too small. all i can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on wotb for 3 man platoons for those that agree with this.another thing for new players is don't judge the game until you're at least at tier 5, and this goes for wotm as well. i've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. it's not just point and click and get a kill (unless you're an old arty or kv-2, then it sometime is). there is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called sidescraping, and many other things that will help you survive in battle. learn you tank too. a panzer iv will have a completely different playstyle than a t1 heavy or kv-1 (these are all tier 5s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. note: these are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. and that concludes this long winded review.",1

14395,"was the awesomenes construction simulator 2014. that is what this game was. note that i'm a tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.i have built:m-35 mako from mass effect 1m-44 hammerhead from mass effect 2.ut-47a kodiak from mass effect 3.terran diamondback from starcraft 2.terran are mercenary siege tank. (yes. the siege breaker from wings of liberty.)but none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, rewards being lowered with improvments to the system, and a plethora of other problems.back in early 2014 i strongly, i repeat, strongly supported this game. strongly, i emphasize this, say it with me. strongly... supported this game. but with every step forward, freejam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- clone warsso let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. this included the hoverblades, plasma launchers, railguns, and thrusters. from level 1 upward of level 3. yes, this happened. freejam didn't change this until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- double edged butt-erynow prior to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a repair function to the game, which put a drain on casual players tiers 6 and up back then. what was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. yes, both rp and tp (robopoints and techpoints).- hero zero next up was the hero system, which allowed you to get the full rp and tp from a match you died in if your team won, but wait! ...at the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. at this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, it's been a massive pain in the - turn up for hatenow, next up, they remove repair cost, yet again, another freaking reward quantity decrease. you getting the pattern yet? don't worry i'll explain it in a second. at this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even more. - from intense to indensethis game was always a one-life team death match game. the respawned and overclocked update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused moba wannabe. even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named classic so far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. but here's the final blow to the old mode: a 80% decrease at this point... to the profit you make from it. classic is now as worthwhile as dumping yourin a toilet...or on a development team. think that's the worst part? oh no. i'm not even finished. - what is wrong with my ing keyboard!?!the controls with any movement design other than tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. as of the r&o update, wheels are incredibly sluggish, rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even one, aerofoils are a disaster to use, walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. and lastly, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.thisgenuinely brings my p!ss to a plasmatic boil. the challenge should not be in handicapping the ing player. - give us ur monies!why all the reward debuffs? because they want money. they want to force the playerbase to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. this game never did have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. and also, no, it's not even classified as pay to win. it's pay to ing progress. - give us ur monies 2!!1the introduction of easy anti cheat, or eac. instead of using steam's vac system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. they decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. you see where this is going? yeah. they drove off a number of their player base stating, if you can't get into robocraft to play because of eac, that is a small price to pay for the issue of hackers trying to ruin our game. the only people who tried to help fix this was eac themselves as i recall, and even then, only under the pressure of the robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - give us ur ferkign muneez!!11!eleven!why did eac have to fix it? because freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. but it doesn't even end there. they won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. not even an ounce. they won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. if they don't like your you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence any and all feedback that involves any kind of actual review with a vengeance. and hell, this hasn't even ended yet. keep reading. this is starting to look like the robocraft holocaust. *shudder* - nerf 'em to the gravenow, the final kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. finally, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of gun bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. i'll give an example. - from speedy to needyi made a vehicle called the masterkill b (frankly can't put the word itself in) which operated on two things: wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. as of 3 days after the r&o update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a treaded tank, and that's with the thrusters on. i guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. without rockets, it's even slower than a tank. believe me, i've tested this one the day i learned of the horror inflicted on the physics engine, which i think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - final thoughtslastly, like i said, i strongly... strongly! supported this game! hell, i even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! but as of now? freejam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. this game had so much potential a year ago. but now it's all been dried up. freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. a year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. but as of now, i can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. a toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, all in the name, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. stay. away. from this hideous deformed child of a game. you will be stricken with it's gods-awful moba wannabe gameplay.[more on my review in the comments section]",0
15727,"trying to recommend this game is trying to tell me that i should kill my palico on monster hunter world: it's impossible.many of artix entertainment's adventures into lore have been interesting, from the ever-nostalgic adventurequest, to the dragon-infested dragonfable, to a lore where every kid who can't pvp uses void highlord on adventurequest worlds. now we have the most linear and most boring of these lore adaptations, not to mention the most toxic of communities.i started playing, got the name chronicle, got the chronomancer set, and i was happy not spending any money on the game. reached the graveyard where everyone else was struggling, and regardless of the many people that are in the area, nobody was interested in helping each other. i do admire, to a full extent, of ae's intention to pull away from the ease of doing everything yourself, to relying constantly on teamwork to push through. while this would normally work, it doesn't when everyone you meet is a constant jerk. even some of the most recognisable faces in aq3d would rather brag about what items they have over helping the newer players who haven't a clue. it's become so biased and it's hasn't had a long full release yet.let's not mention a lie that has doomed the game from the very start. it had been started that as we have always said, micro-currency will never pay-to-win power but will be used to (among other things) save time, which was intended for the crafting system, but the rest of the game is reliant on being as rich as a guy with a burning flames team captain on tf2 just to catch up from level 1 without missing out. the kickstarter rewards, not to mention, are nonsensical. instead of physical items that can be souvenirs from a time where you provided monetary assistance to get the game out, you're instead treated to virtual items that may/may not provide a headstart to a game that was meant to be free of the p2w stigma. instead, they've since welcomed it. it's the typical steam mmo we hoped it wouldn't be.it's such a shame. as artix von krieger's friend and fan, i'm utterly disappointed with how aq3d turned out. sad to say, there's no way to fix it.",0
881,"this is a moba game with big spaceships and even bigger potential.whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter, but they're definitely on the right track. if the premise sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission. it's very well done.however, it is early access, and as such, there are a lot of missing functions, some balance issues, bugs, and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed. my biggest concern at the moment, in terms of i want to have fun right now, is the lack of tooltip details.let me explain. you get choices on which weapons/abilities to load your ship with. however, there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name. so you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they're supposed to work. yes, this will obviously be addressed, but in the game's current state, there's sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve.still, once i figured things out, i started having a ton of fun, and i'm glad i paid the $10. i'm having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces.",1

11100,"enjoy this game a lot, the defense and faction mechanics set it apart from other ccgs. however i never recieved packs that were promised as part of a promotion that was actually the reason i bought in-game currency so until this issue is solved i will be leaving this review negative and advising against buying this game.issue solved, very responsive support. now onto an actual review of the game. first i'll start with the cons. i don't believe that eternal is the best or the most unique ccg ever. for me that honour would have to go to chronicle: runescape legends (r.i.p). i also disagree with what some others have said that this is the fairest ccg out there for f2p players. due to the sheer amount of deck faction combinations and the lack of any sort of cap on legendaries used in decks, there are a lot of high-cost legendary cards and the best decks contain a lot of them. you only have to do a quick search for eternal decks to see that many recommended decks contain upwards of 18 legendaries. you do earn coins very fast but not particularly faster than other ccgs. you are however given many more packs and single cards as rewards, and as far as i can tell the legendary drop rate is higher than most. however, i don't believe this entirely makes up for the card volume and cost to the point where you could call it the fairest on the market.on to the pros. while i said it is not the best or most unique ever, i certainly believe it is the best and most unique ccg out right now. the mechanisms force you to actually use your head. logic and math come into it more than most, if not all other games of this nature and you will find yourself in chesslike scenarios fairly often and will lose because of poor strategy rather than bad luck, such is the case with too many other digital card games.there is so much to do in this game, so many replayable game modes, including a vast singleplayer experience, something many will be grateful for. and the singleplayer campaigns are purchaseable with the relatively easily earned non-premium currency! as well as this you can keep all the cards you handpick in the forge and draft modes and, while the price of playing these modes is a little steep, you don't have to even play too well to earn at least half of it back. also, free cards.all-in-all, i would say this is worth your time if you've played similar games but are after something with a little more depth.",1

2662,"as a veteran player of this game with over 1200 hours before finally throwing in the towel... it's full of development bias, a salty community and very questionable business practice. they've hired research consultants who generally make up their own facts and have no background in historical research, treat their players more like cattle than consumers and have two separate development teams; one for russian vehicles, another for everything else. that alone raises a few red flags.i really tried to like this game and sunk a lot of time and effort into it and it's community, but all i have to show for it is the company banning both myself and dozens of other users for critical thinking of their product and business, and have received everything up to and including death threats from community members solely because i have differing interests and views.the game was once fine, but gaijin has been progressively ruining it by pandering to their home nation rather than the international market and feels that their player base is disposable, milking them for a few bucks and then kicking them aside for a few new players rather than trying to maintain the interest and respect of their veteran users.play at your own risk.spoiler: russia wins.",0

6977,"there seem to be plenty of reviews from the perspective of people who are ccg veterans, but not many from the ccg novice. i will writing this review as someone for whom tes: legends is their first ccg. i have also been playing the game for about 6 months via the bethesda launcher, so the low hours recorded on steam is not accurate.tesl provides an excellent new player experience for those unfamiliar with ccg mechanics. not only did it gently, but firmly, move me towards understanding the concept of a creature-based card game as a whole, but it also smoothly integrated the game's unique mechanics into the learning process as well, such as the lane and prophecy systems. not only that, but during the story campaign (which serves as an extended tutorial) you are provided with five separate decks for free that allow you to experience different classes and archetypes of play. while it is relatively easy to move through most of the story using these reconstructed decks, the final encounter of the campaign is difficult enough that it forced me into the deck builder to try and craft a deck that was better than the starter decks. while veteran ccg players might scoff at the difficulty of the pve campaign, for a new ccg player, there were some legitimate challenges that forced me to learn the mechanics and think about my choices. as i result, i felt much more prepared for when i began challenging actual humans not long after.as a f2p title, the monezation of the game needs to be addressed. overall, i feel that tesl offers great value simply by playing the game, either by winning consistently on the ladder, or by competing in vs/solo arena. all told, it is quite viable to be a f2p player and have a lot of fun in the game, and there are plenty of people over on the subreddit who have hit legend using nothing but f2p decks. i think it is necessary to mention that i am not a f2p player, but given the minimal monetary investment i have put into this game, i feel like i have been provided a solid foundation that allows me to avoid spending money later, rather than feeling like i need to continuously inject cash to stay competitive. for a game that i play casually, this is very important to me, and i imagine many others as well.finally, i need to talk about the setting. as an elder scrolls fan, i love being able to recognize the references in the card collection, and feel that the abilities, artwork, and voice lines all complement the characters they are intended to potray. some of the card references are fairly obscure, too. while odhaviing, miraak, or divayth fyr may be immediately recognizable to many tes veterans, characters such as ahnassi, gortwog, and allena benoch i needed to look up.tl;dr tesl is a great game for people who are new to ccg's as well, and offers a fair f2p with a characters that will appeal to tes fans from pretty much any game. i highly recommend. especially given it's free. seriously, it's freee. there is literally no barrier to trying this besides maybe 30 min of download time and possibly a cap on your downloads per month. try it.",1

10686,"the best streamlined card game i've played, beating hearthstone, hex, and magic duels. the game is also extremely generous for a f2p entry and gives you tons of ways to earn coins and packs.there are so many ways to play!1. campaigns. free to enter. a short set of campaigns against ai opponents that guide you through game mechanics. they are a little boring and could use some rework, as they've been around for a long time. you get rewarded with a basic card pool.2. puzzles. free to enter. 80 puzzles centered around game mechanics that teach you corner cases and nuances. a blast to play, and you get rewarded with a good bit of gold.3. gauntlet. free to enter. most useful gold farming mode. you face off 7 ai opponents and are challenged to beat them all without losing. doing so net's you a 'rank up' containing packs and gold until you heart max rank (master). after master, you can still grind gauntlet for the rewards of two silver chests containing gold.4. forge. free to enter. mix between draft and sealed like hearthstone's arena, you pick one of three given cards until you end up with a 25 card deck. you face ai opponents until you either win seven or lose 2. if you win seven, you rank up just like gauntlet.5. draft. 5k gold to enter. draft a card from a booster pack and pass the rest to your neighbor, until you have drafted 40+ card. make a deck and then play other players. 7 wins or 3 losses. 3 wins and you are ahead. 7 wins and you get a ton of stuff! your win record is tracked and you are ranked from bronze to master.6. casual. free to enter. constructed play against another player but your win record/rank isn't recorded. minimal rewards from winning, but great to try out decks or get used to constructed.7. ranked. free to enter. constructed play against another player and your win record is recorded. winning can rank you up from bronze to master. gauntlet has better gold/minute but trying to hit diamond/master in ranked is a challenge of it's own. 8. events. variable cost to enter. the devs run events (usually 1-2 a month) with special deck construction rules (i.e. mono color decks only) or play rules (draw 2 cards a turn). variables prizes, but almost always worth doing.if you are starting out, play gauntlet until you get to gold or diamond and are having a hard time winning. then play forge to master. then return to gauntlet. then draft until you run out of gold. then play gauntlet and ranked and save gold to draft more. somewhere in there do some fun puzzles.at the end of each month you get rewarded packs for your ranked and draft ranks.i've only played for a couple of months, and i have 3 fully built tier 1-2 constructed decks, and am working on . my friend started less than a month ago and already has 40k gold (9 drafts not including winnings!).",1

14006,"-you must be desperate if you call this fun-this game is what you get if you steal code from dayz mod, add skins from cs:go, and h1z1 into one game.i started this game knowing it was complete i just wanted to know how bad it really was. when i first spawned i had some bizarre glow around me and i can only assume it was a shield keeping me from being spawn-killed. i then turned my camera and had my first little giggle. rotating the camera causes the character to spazz out and break its back. i did this for about a minute. second thing i tried naturally was attacking a zombie, just to see how deadly they were. melee with a flashlight does nothing btw. however, that is far less important than the clearly stolen code and animation from dayz mod for the zombies. if you played the mod of dayz you know what im talking about. i really didn't last much longer after this. i entered a near by hanger? and saw what i can only describe as a truck from a play station 1 game, and that's a generous comment. but what really got me, was the fact that all of the guns had thick blue outlines so you could see them. honestly i can't say just how embarrased these devs should feel about this game.last but certainly not least. when you die you have to wait 8minutes to respawn your character. i don't understand why people let themselves be sucked into these traps. i feel like they have horrible computers and justinternet and don't have much choice or something along those lines.i really hope steam bans these dev's from ever publishing a game on their platfrom. i'm really surprised they've allowed it to remain.",0
15105,"i played this game about a year back (i stopped shortly after they released legs) and came back now to see what happened to the game in the meantime. for someone who really enjoyed how the game used to work, it's a big disappointment now. the removal of blocks with different durabilities might have been a defendable change, since some might argue that it turned the game into a bit of a grind, but replacing it with a system built on loot crates with random contents and weapons as different rarity drops makes no sense in this kind of game. the healing of damage dealt to your robot (at least in the gamemodes where you can actually find a game in a reasonable time) might be nice if it happens to you, but is utterly frustrating when a fast enemy just escapes from your view to return unharmed a few seconds later. for me the fun in the early stages of robocraft was in building a robot with multiple propulsion systems and failsafes to make sure i can still fight after taking damage, it was in batteling a crippeled enemy while trying to angle my weapon with my one remaining leg. of cause it takes away waiting time from the game, but the cost is a lot of what made robocraft unique.it seems like someone decided to take the regeneration of a modern shooter (without taking into account how little sense that makes for robots), the lootcrate system of overwatch (with the difference that the crates actually contain stuff that changes the gameplay, making it almost pay to win) and the slow progression of warframe (which is worse since the game is pvp not pve so the loadout actually matters).i can see how players like some of these changes and i can see how players that played a lot and dont mind to spend some money from time to time will still enjoy the game, but i would not pick it up as a new player, there are better f2p games out there and i would not come back to it if you enjoyed it when it first started. i uninstalled it again; it's a shame, i really enjoyed the original robocraft.",0

(you can't see the sarcasm but its there!) if you play in the left lane your shackled for a round, if you go on the right you can be knocked into the left lane. add a timer that cannot be removed or sent back to his hand! and the battle becomes a chore, i got him to 6 of his health and he regens it back with health cards and minions that give him health. once again i say this to someone you shouldnt have time limits in a card game! especially because all strategy flies out the window, every deck is useless because if the time hits 0, you lose immediatly. and the way his ai is set up he dosn't attack your minions at all unless their guards, speaking of which he had all guard cards mostly, i nearly one but he cheated, and i'm serious i don't know if its a glitch or something but he pulled out a 4th version of a card that was a guard and i lost because i didn't have enough minions, it dosn't take ten turns to win a match unless the player is a even match against the cp!despite...all that i still reccomend the game, not because of the dlcs but because its still a good card game overall, just don't buy the darkbrotherhood dlc unless they post something saying the've nerfed it so people actually win.rant done. go play the free part of the game.",1

14941,"this is probably the most dissapointing game i've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. this includes overpowered weapons that 1 shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, i could go on for hours.the largest problem i've encountered is players attaching a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. this mainly occurs with the new aeroflak cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.secondly the insane cost of items. so you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money. now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs 400 and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. so, you play another match...but there's someone with an aeroflak, by the way did i mention that the aeroflak costs 75,000 to buy?but thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs 125,000 to buy, and i bet that leaves you wondering but how do i get that? well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending more money.anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.this has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? well other than costing a ton of money (a single day costs 1) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. all of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?1/10 huge dissapointment",0

6162,"this game is most likely the worst game i have ever played in my life. for the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game. then comes level 3. after level 3 the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either p2w f***, or just people who have played longer. if you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. your gun takes 2-3 hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend 10-30 seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? and if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are 10 times worse. they camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. if you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. the player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. but, the game has to have tanks. you cant have a wwii war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level 3 to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to 10 tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. in assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish) let's move on to the economy. every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. you also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. any half decent gun costs $50,000+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. the game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but i have 65 hours into the game and still have trash weapons. i'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so i can get better weapons. [edit 1]: oops! silly me, i forgot about one of the most important things! you might be thinking okay, this game is in beta, it still has potential, right? well, this latest update made me think wrong. the soviet union was added as a faction (team) to the game. now, first of all, for the majority of the war the u.s. and the soviet union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. i dont. what i do care about is the fact that they made the soviet union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior; especially the ppd-40. the ppd is a 71 round mag smg. compared to the m3 grease gun and the mp34, its totally op. the next smg you get is the ppsh. once again, 71 round mag, upgradable to 900 rpm (rounds per minute). 71 shots at 900 rpm = op. [edit 2]: as you can see, my hours have raised since i wrote this review. now, this is not because i'm a hypocrite, its becuase my little brother hasn't realized that this game is not a good game, and everyday forces me to play with him. once he realizes, just like me, that this is not a good game, i will have no reason to play it.[edit 3]: let's also talk about at (anti-tank). tanks in this game are completely unbalanced, especially in skirmish, but at least the developers were kind enough to give us infantry a way to kill tanks. mines, sticky grendes, and rocket launchers. for grenades and mines, you have to be right up near the tank, which is impossible to do if they are camping or have infantry guarding them. rocket launchers are a little bit better, but they take up so much inventory space you can only cary a sa-rifle or a ba-rifle, and you can barely sprint. the other thing is that the game doesn't want people destroying tanks, so they make the at weapons so overpriced they are literally unusable. sticky grenades are the best example. it takes 3 sticky grenades to destroy a tank. the cost of using 3 sticky grenades is 1100 credits. (average salary per game = 3000-5000 credits). you are paying a large chunk of your salary to destroy one tank, and the tank driver has to pay maybe 100-500.[edit 4]: one other thing. the game's matchmaking sometimes decides to match you in a game that is already almost over, meaning you will automatically be paid 0 credits. if you are like me and your gun is very expensive to maintain, you are losing alot of money by playing.",0

14525,"i got this game as a gift several months ago. when i got the game, i encountered a game of creativity and of combat, which i liked. the game's ranking system made sure you were matched with comparable bots with comparable armaments, which resulted in fairly intense matches with two nearly equally matched teams. however, as of the latest big update, the game suffers from a horrible game balance issue. weapons are now handed out at random, and 'rare' weapons are able to unilaterally dominate battles. the new crate system intends to reward good gameplay, but the tiering of crates is largely cosmetic, with the highest teir gear being practically the same rarity in low tier crates as in high tier crates. their rarity is hardly a justificaton for the weapons' power, especially since for a few bucks, people can buy the highest tier crates. robocraft discourages new players by pitting them against the power weapons with little to defend themselves. robocraft discourages the creative process by making roughly three styles of vehicles the only survivable ones, and by making the power weapons so costly to add to a bot (in terms of pflops, the game's unit of bot complexity) that if a bot is to be effective, it must be extremely basic with a power weapon on it. robocraft discourages veterans of the game by making the level system and robot rank system nearly obsolete, turning the game's tech tree into a game of chance. the power weapons were originally only available by purchase, so the update did do good by taking previous 'pay to win' weapons and making them at least remotely accessible for free. but robocraft is no longer a game of skill and creativity. its balancing points have become a wheel of fortune, a wheel that can be greased by money (that runs a risk of being wasted since rarities still exist in the purchasable crates).in short, the game used to be fun. once again in gaming history, crates corrupted the game.",0

487,"update: currently getting refunds, went to see if i could make an in game purchase, give them the benefit of the doubt. nope, links to the store, still nothing.until or unless the trading cards are relabeled correctly as collector items specifically for this game, i can only come to the conclusion that steamworks have been scammed into promoting this with certain features to get money for themselves and whomever they allowed booster ability.unless you're a fan of the artist or clicker hero type games, which you honestly could be going elsewhere for anyway, this is the absolute worst form of begging i've seen.don't offer trading cards when you can't unlock booster. stop advertising the feature, it's dishonest and scummy. if there hadn't been trading cards, i would have been happy to have bought and kept the dlc, but you lied, so no sale.tl:dr do not put any money into this game and just play it for free, false advertising on cards, side stepping steam taxes by linking to a personal artist account patreon subscriptiondo not buy dlc for this gamedo not buy cards for this game until boosters are freed from this hostage situationthe steam dlc doesn't count towards booster unlock.in game only to unlock, no in game shop, only in game purchase option goes to a patreon and all discussions end with just buy off the market or they'll even say, gems, but once again, this is ignoring the very glaring problem of not being able to get the booster unlock.the discussion page even has a sticky post that says cards are coming...half a year ago with a n/t = no text. clearly, people have booster capability and the developer is ignoring questions on how others may also obtain it.not being able to unlock booster while others obviously have seals the deal, i know a racket when i see one, but just when you thought broken and discontinued items on steam were bad enough, this is clearly misadvertised as having trading cards when the low amount and high prices for the cards and boosters clearly screams some of somebodies buddies were given the feature so they can sell the cards while others weren't. at a ransom price for cards in general. ...30 cents for one reg card.is this a f2p that i can spend 40 dollars with my steam wallet or a hostage situation?i'm going to look around for someone to make this right, but for all intents and purposes, do not buy dlc if you're looking to unlock booster, something is terribly wrong here and it stinks.what the actual fdoes gabe know you're side stepping steam sales and are technically mislabeling your product?",0

5726,"dcs world is a great hardcore combat flight sim with a crazy amount of detail and i love it for that but something about the game doesn't feel the same as il-2 1946 or strike fighters 2. i think it comes down to a few things with me. 1: content is lacking. compaired to il-2 and sf2 the game feels a little barebones with its selection of aircraft. yes the detail is much higher in dcs but i would rather see eagle dynamics come out with more playable aircraft if it means dropping the detail to that of fc3.2: no middle ground. its full sim or nothing in dcs and thats fine but tbh i like the way il-2 and sf2 handle sims and having the option just to set things as easy or as hard as i want. (sometimes i just want to blow s*** up) without going though the hassel. 3: mod support. this leads back to the issue of not having a wide selection of aircraft in dcs and its far from having any type of mod library that gets close to il-2 or sf24: price of dlc. now i'm no stranger to paying for dlc on a simulator (god knows i spent a lot in train simulator) but thats the thing. for me it comes down to why pay when i can get a mod for sf2? if they lowered the cost i wouldn't mind picking put more then what i have but at $50 i find it hard to justify getting one.dcs world is a great sim, but is it on my favorites list? no, it doesn't have the aircraft i like and it doesn't give me the same joy and gameplay experience that i look for in a sim. 7/10",1

1079,ok so i saw this game for fee on the store for the weekend so got it under the asumption of well cost me nothing so worth a try. i am recomending this game however there are some bad points which i am going to get out of the way first. when first loaded i did have some major bugs one crashed my pc completely and another was if i tabed out i could not get back on without restarting the game both seem to have fixed on their own. another problem is limited content and microtransactions the bane of a gamers existance however its mostly to speed up getting ships or getting skins and there is more content on the way hopefully a few more maps as well as a new gamemode. i have just played over 10 hours in the last two days some with a friend some alone and have now come to the end of the exitement phase and the next ships i want are hours of gameplay or real money away so will not be playing all the time next week but will pop on for a match or so as it is very fun.now onto the good stuff..the combat is simple and entuative but rewarding flying a massive capital ship into battle is awsome.the ships are amazing they look good and they do play differently so you can play a variety of roles as well as the starter ships being competative so you can get on fine from you first game.playing with a friend you can comunicate with makes you far more combat effective and more enjoyable would be nice to have the option of being a team of 5 but that may be unfair.finally the value if you can get it on the free weekend just do its free fun if not its not overly expensive and it works not like half the alpha junk you find on here begging for full price for nothing. suffers from a few alpha problems but fun and plays well.have fun guys.,1
17299,"i was very thrilled to play this game after watching the films and series, but this game is very disappointing, most of the new dragons that have been introduced in the series, are only for members only. they say that nothing is for free these days yet when i used to play games nothing was that hard to get, but these days its cash, its very disapointing, but let me shed some light on this game before i get to the huge down fall, this game is going to be mostly recommneded to the fans of the 'how to train your dragon' this games style and design looks a lot like the style of the series that is currently on netflix, the characters of the main cast are in it and help you along the way, you even get to meet their dragons as well.the area of the game changes to the current season which is nice and you can recognize a lot of the areas. you get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form, very cute and you get to choose the colours, but you can't fly for a very long time. reminded me of istaria the animation mechanics are ok a little buggy but not bad now here are the down fallssometimes when exiting the area, the loading screen will come up, it will nag you to get a membership, it will take a while to get to the next area, once it does, it will appear again before you can move on and do your quests or tasks around the area, sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash.i struggled to get out of this on wide screen, so if any of you have a pc that struggles to run these types of games, please keep it on window just incase it decides to crash on you.after the crash i decided to check the reviews, sadly all the negatives were right you take a few steps and it already crashes on you, exit an area to another it will crash, go fishing, it will lag so much as well as when you chop down trees for wood, it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc.another reason to keep it on window.unfortunatly i had to get rid of the game due to the graphics and lagging on the game, it crashed 3 times.loading it back up is more quicker than getting around the areas.don't play this game if you dont want your pc to suffer from crashes and freezesplay this game on window just to be safebut overall i highly recommended you to not play this game, its needs much more work because it still looks like its in testing, it looks very much like the old graphics from a very old console, lets say ps1 sort of style, yes i know that sounds very harsh but its true. it also needs more free stuff than just membership stuff. the lag makes it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere. i am very disappointed in this game, but if your little ones would like to play it, make sure your pc can run alright on it, and keep it on window just be on the safe side, but don't be surprised if it crashes on window screens as well.",0

845,"i really think this game is a lot of fun and that is has potential. i'm really surprised that this game has made it this far into development. though there are bugs in the game, there are very minimal and are extremely rare to come across. when i started playing the early build of this game, i started to encounter hackers in the game, but as the game progresses in development, i started to see less and less. this shows me how much time and effort is being put into the game to make it enjoyable for everyone. i approve this game and can't wait for it to become out of its beta stage and be set to go into the actual steam store page listed not as an early access beta, but as an actual free-to-play game.",1
12051,"do not buy in the current state. thankfully, i was able to obtain a refund after 17 hours of game time.it's been a good two days and nothing notable has been done by the bless team to fix the plethora of issues the game faces. i cannot recommend this to anyone until the devs fix a huge majority of their issues. they've got a really huge wall in front of them to overcome if they are to hope to succeed.after giving the bless team some time (since ea launch 2 days ago) to iron out their issues, nothing notable has been done to address the plethora of issues that it is facing.the issue that everyone faces is the incredibly poor performance - both server side and client side. in addition to that, frequent maintenance & server crashes worsen the experience (but of course, this is to be expected for any mmo launch). fps wise without the player-made tweaks, i got below 30 fps in towns and a frequent below 40 fps outside of towns (my rig runs gtx1080, 16 gb ram, i7-6700). on a side-note, there have been guides written by players (not developers) to help alleviate the fps issues which work to some extent but still does not help the experience too much (and rightfully, it should be the devs who published the guide or patch to address this issue, not the players).gameplay wise, it is not what one would expect for a price tag of 30/40 usd (and above) - the entire world is unpolished. dialogue, quests and plot are poorly written and boring. animations are blocky and unpolished. sound effects are horrible (sounds like what i would get from an indie game) - voice acting is worse. i did a level 31 dungeon that had a cooldown of a couple of minutes which makes absolutely no sense in an mmorpg that requires you to grind for levels and loot. loot in dungeons with a party follows the traditional bid system and does not prioritize giving the item to the correct classes. another gripe i have with the game is that if a player tags a field mob first, the mob's rewards are his and only his.i grinded to mid-endgame thinking that the game would be more fun then, but it isn't - it's the same thing, except with field pvp (and people ganging up to get kills).the combat system has potential, but isn't quite there yet. i enjoyed being able to have options to chain my combos into - based on what i wanted and how i planned to attack. however, the two most blatant frustrations that i have (and other players too) are:1. missing an attack would completely reset the combo.2. using a non-stance ability would reset the combos. this is incredibly painfully frustrating for me. coming from ff14 where we have off-gcd abilities, i cannot fathom as to why the developers would decide that using a non-stance ability should reset the combos. that makes it incredibly counter-intuitive to use any of your non-stance abilities - which means you either use them before you start combos or at the end of the combos only. so why would i want to blink mid-fight if i cannot for-the-love-of-god chain my high-damage combos or stuns? why would i want to cast counterspell when it completely disrupts my combo? if you have played league of legends before, imagine you're yasuo, you have 3 stacks of gathering storm (q) and you're going to go in for the huge knockup play, but you have to flash to get in range - but wait, flashing completely removes your 3 stacks and you can't knockup anymore. neowiz, why?the combo resets make it seem as if the devs have not play-tested the combat enough, or even knowledgeable/talented enough to understand what constitutes a good and smooth combat flow.besides that, the game could do with an innate dodge ability besides the one non-stance ability you equip. blinking should also not lock your movement (there's a short 0.5? second delay before you can move again) after usage.the skill/talent tree (whatever it was called) was confusing and poorly designed. it had combat stats, exp stats, gold stats all mixed into the same tree. it is also a linear skill tree for each of the four paths which makes it incredibly boring. leveling the skills / abilities / talents used some form of currency which i'm not sure how to obtain except from rewards through quests - not via leveling, which is really confusing (at least for me).crafting was.. meh. few crafting options, and lots of the materials i did not know how to obtain so i did not even bother much with crafting. i crafted some baguettes and a necklace only and gave up on the rest.repairing / enhancing / taming - tedious and confusing.besides that, another unacceptable issue is that the localization is incredibly poorly done - the worst i have seen for a game i have ever paid for. i cannot figure out most of my skills due to the poor translation. also, a prime example of poor localization is that the mailbox receive button is translated to gift - yes, gift which is supposed to be the button you click to receive items from the mail. it's as if they simply threw their localization strings into google translate, plopped it into the game and never looked at it again.another opinion i have is that the outfit design is really bland and boring - even those on the cash shop. i did not find even 1 outfit to my liking.i had thought they would be able to iron out all the issues by launch day (or planned & shared a roadmap or informative post to address the issues) but it seems i was mistaken. all they have ever done is just post on character creation restrictions, adding new servers, maintenances and a notice that they were aware of server issues. then, they had the nerve to post about game balance (healing not as potent as damage) when the fundemental issues that actually allow for a smooth gaming experience weren't even addresed.what i liked:1. character creation - good. it's good and has lots of customization options. i only didn't like the voice options, otherwise it's pretty solid.2. combat - kinda. i had fun with the combat except for the few setbacks and frustrations i had mentioned above.tldr;the bad:1. bad performance - fps (30 & below on a good rig) & server lag.2. poor gameplay - lackluster quests / storyline / dungeons.3. bad audio - poor sound quality & bad voice acting.4. disappointing combat - combos being cancelled/reset by missed attacks & usage of any non-stance abilities.5. horrible localization - the worst i have ever seen. everything seems to be taken from google translate.6. no roadmap/plans from devs on issue fixes.7. (opinion) bland & boring outfits.8. other issues faced by other players such as friends not being able to get in the same server and them getting their items server & character bound.the good:1. character creation has lots of customization options except i didn't like the voices.2. combat feels fun at first because of the many available combo-chain options but fails to impress later on due to the frustrating mechanics (see point 4 above).thank you for reading and sorry for the incredibly long rant.",0
9810,"i was actually very surprised by this game. it was free so i decided to try it, and i have to say the gameplay was very pleasing. the artstyle was also a factor, it's not fancy, but it gives the world a very quaint charm that makes you want to come back.the different classes and the class evolution system is pretty solid, and each class branch certainly fills in it's own unique role. with six base classes and with 3 possible branches for each one, there is almost certainly a class suited to your style of play.the combo system isn't too hard to master, and stringing together hit after hit feels very satisfying. each class's skills are also very diverse and different from another, adding a whole new level of gameplay to master with each class.in conclusion, i am very glad that i discovered this little gem of a game. it was very fun to play.the only drawbacks i can see is that after a while the game can feel kind of boring, and the art, while quaint, feels a bit too cute at times for my taste.",1

2074,"path of exile is the most faithful successor to diablo 2 that you'll find, including diablo 3. while d3 took the approach of world of warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, path of exile leans in the opposite direction. it's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. truly, if feels as if everything that diablo 3 did wrong, path of exile does right.the one area that poe really diverges from the classic diablo formula is in the active skill system. active skills are granted by gem items. skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with support gems in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.and that's what's really great about this game. the enormous scope of build variety and character customization. poe's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over 100 passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. want to build a huge, muscle-bound marauder that casts spells and holds wands? want to create a witch or ranger that uses a cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? go for it. if you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.it's the most technical hack-and-slash arpg out there, and likely the most unforgiving. the path to 100 is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. it might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. the challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.and, somehow, the game is entirely free. there is -zero- pay to win here. you can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. there is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.as a huge fan of the genre, poe really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now.",1

8925,"planetside 2 is the one of, if not the only game out there that allows you to do battle against literally hundreds of people at the same time. one of my favorite games at the moment. i recommend it, but with a warning. this game has a very sharp learning curve. when you first begin you're going to die. a lot. and sometimes with zero warning. it's definitly frustrating getting shot out of seemingly knowhere when you first start, but as you play more you'll get better at the game (duh) and become more aware of your surroundings. you'll begin to see your deaths coming, and thus will be able to react accordingly. and no, it's not pay to win. sure, you can spend real money for in game currency so you can buy different guns and gear, but none of these things are inherently better than another. in fact, the your starter gun is arguably the best gun in the game. here's a video that explains that better than i could: you decide you want to try ps2 out, i recommend you watch these videos so you aren't completly lost when you start (of course, you don't have to. just a recommendation): to be seeing you on the battlefield!",1

11447,"this game is pretty fun. i like to play it when i need to vent off from other games. the mechanics are well made and if you play others fps games you will easily carry your skills over. it looks like a cod game while it feels like your playing csgo a nice mixture of both if you ask me. this game is free to play so there are some micro transactions within the game. but i would say it's not that bad. but this game isn't all awesome, it has some flaws like any other game. there are two things i feel like i have to adress in the game. first the loot boxes. 9/10 boxes you're gonna open are gonna contain either nates for a couple of days or you get a skin for a day. so it really feels like nothing. to get these skins permanent you have to buy ingame currency and buy loot boxes. and you're gonna get smoke and grenates lasting for a year before you get the skin you want. second the matchmaking is one of the worst i've seen in any game. i play with 2-3 friends when im playing black squad and we always either play against people that have several hundreds of hours more than us, or players that literally tries the game for the first time.conclusion: i think it's a fun game when i need to vent from other games, but not a game i can sit and play for hours. definetely worth trying out atleast.tip: there are 3x free weapon dlc's that you can download that let's you try all (or most of them) weapons for 15days. so you have two weeks to find a weapon you prefer and then you can spend your free 200k on your favourite weapon when it's time is up.",1

4044,"roman catholic sign of the cross is upside down, done with five fingers instead of three, is done from left to right instead of right to left, etc. (basically inviting demons). antichrist's third temple will have 8 chambers: a chamber per main religion; antichrist will be crowned in this temple; during crowning, he won't read the belief prayer correctly (rejecting christ and acknowledging himself); when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show), many people will see his big nails and will reject him; patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist; antichrist will kill him. also, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the 8th wolf council; others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. roman catholics, satanists, and buddhists use the same mudras; if you see these mudras on an icon, then it's not orthodox icon; orthodox icon has ic xc symbol (jesus christ). roman catholics pay drunks and strippers to pose for icons; passions of drunks and strippers transfer to those who pray to these images. normal orthodox icons are inspired by the holy spirit. gaad in ruski = satan; hence, americans = blasphemers because they always say: oh, my god!. santa (word for saint in satanic languages) = satan; hence, spanish + italian + portuguese = blasphemers. anathema to satanic languages; triple anathema. learn church slavonic; no curses in it; curses = prayer to satan. all religions except orthodoxy worship satan. on bread for communion: ic xc nika (jesus christ conquers) plus cross = orthodox; hexagram plus dusha maya = antichrist. jews and muslims pray head down (either standing, bowing, or kneeling); this is satanic prayer. orthodox look into the eyes of icon; energy goes their way; they get healed; head and shoulders come together to reject satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to christ and not the devil. hands cannot be on groin or behind back; either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. clergy who will not put buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood will be killed; only 7 churches will be left as pelageya of ryazan predicted. in 2006 and at other meetings, fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same supreme being; triple anathema; don't let heretics tell you what to do. america will be last country to switch to euro. three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in russia; 2nd (bigger one) in china; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in america. nato will nuke ukraine to blame russia for it; then nato will nuke russia from scandinavia. china will attack russia; but will not get past ural mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against chinese soldiers (they will run back to china and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze siberia to - 200 celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). russia will destroy turkey and america. china will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. only eurasia and alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and greenland melts. move to ural mountains or inland alaska. sionists wanted war between russia and germany from june 11th to october 11th on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). tube people = demons. clones = demons. human costumes that demons wear = demons. dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded dna; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). demons live inside clones. bacteriologist alexandre yersin (who discovered bubonic plague) is depicted on the shroud of turin. there is another shroud (shroud of milan) on which blasphemer yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 ad) is depicted. menachem mendel schneerson, lenin (el=deity in hebrew, nine = no in german; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the creator), and yosef were possessed by azazel; now, rico cortes is possessed by azazel. ww3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. isis stands for israeli secret intelligence service. next false flag: statue of liberty in order to attack iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. all metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug dna, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru ivs, implants, fillings, etc. if 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. seraphim of sarov and sergiy of radonezh will be resurrected after ww3 for a short time; seraphim of sarov will show the new ruski tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. those who go see seraphim of sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the most holy trinity); pillars stand on water at zero kelvin. zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. sleep fully clothed; pray the jesus prayer. pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. humans were created about 7525 years ago. ruski orthodox christian vyacheslav krasheninnikov was the last prophet before enoch and elijah return to preach against the antichrist. birds participate in time creation. it's a sin to kill birds. dinosaurs live under our level. they will get out through sinkholes and lakes. to kill them, go for their nerves. save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. first dinosaur will come out of volga river in russia. demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. demons will invite people to be healed inside their ufos; those who go will be like zombies after. gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. if you're being abducted, slowly pray the jesus prayer. don't panic. demons use diamonds and souls to power their ufo craft. the bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. demons have 4 ufo bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain kailash in tibet 3)in lake baikal in russia 4)in atlantis which is underneath the mariana trench in pacific ocean. there are no aliens. nobody lives on other planets. airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight jesus. antichrist is pale with red eyes. he's possessed by satan since he's 12 years old. he flies very fast; deceived people will say that christ is here; christ is there. sometimes, he wears blue robe over left shoulder while red robe is underneath. he wears gloves to hide long nails. he's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.",1

15796,"a developer from artix entertainment had requested reviews from players after only being in open beta for one hour which is a bit of a joke but i have enough to make a review so here it is.quick review for those with more time on your hands.is it worth playing: not really there are better games out there for free unless you intend to play on tablet or androidhow would you rate it out of 10? : a solid 4 its a game equivilant of meh would i recommend to others : nope id suggest playing adventure quest worlds instead is it a lot better constructed considering it is a sider scrolling web based game.---the first and biggest issue is the fact that this game was originally aimed at pc players of aqworlds as the next aq game and yet they spent so much time making the controls work for mobile/tablet users that they have forgotten how make it interesting for pc players. character customization : it is pretty standard and not a lot of variations even with the added barber shop into the game so not alot to talk about there.the pathing and quest system are a joke because as of right now after you finish the tutorial you and just smack bang in this town that you are expected to know the layout and locations of everything with just random npcs offering you quests for npcs that you cannot find by a tracker or even in the quest information. so you are literally screwed from the word *go* and if you have no prior experience of the game you are screwed.now onto monsters : at the moment of writing this it is in open beta so its to be expected that things need to be worked out, but currently i was dealing 1/5th of the damage i was being dealt by monsters of the same level as myself and for the sake of arguements i was a fully geared warrior so it makes zero sense that i should be getting destroyed by one monster as the same level as me.combat system: this is where i believe that artix entertainment has done quite well for themselves because the actual animations of the attacks are quite good so in that regards i commend them but due to the long drawn out animations it would seem that where i as the player would get one special move off the opposing monster/s will be able to get 2 or even 3 attacks off therefore rendering my damage pointless because they have caught up to my damage spike and even done some more which inturn requires me to demolish my supplies of potions that i have/had.ui/menu : again i honestly think artix entertainment has really done well on the ui and menu system, for a phone or tablet game, there is no need to restrict pc users to such a simplistic and just empty screen and weirdly enough they have locked the chatbox to the topleft of the screen even though ther is nothing else on the bottom left, which is another indication that they only thought about phone and tablet users.sounds and music : i think the music is alright not the best but what the hell its better than nothing am i right ? but when looting or attacking it suddenly gets extremely loud and every time you loot a monster it is preset to make the sound of a chest opening when your opening a bag, now thats just lazy because it doesnt take a lot of time to make 2 different sounds for different containers of items that monsters will drop. the attacking noises are extremely loud for really no reason in really random areas, such as making that trademark *sheen* noise when it is swung but it is so loud if you really want to listen to it id highly recommend making the sound very low.",0

3398,"i will start by saying i have played this game before it was out on steam. i've enjoyed this game as well as pubg.i am a big fan of both. they both have their differences but i like the end play of this one better. it is a huge thrill having to climb up the ladder and hope you strategize correctly to not get shot to board safely. the storm is also a different twist making it more random then a circle within a circle. you have to play different to stay infront of the storm but also how you move within the map. instead of a parachuting from plane to pick your location you pick before the game starts. you also no longer look for backpacks but choose your mobility perk at the start when choosing your location which decides how much you can carry. a glider can carry the least but move the fastest in the map. hiking/rappelling which moves slow through the map but can carry the most. sense the map is all snow the last mobility perk is a snowboard. your carry limit is in between the other two.. there is also ski lifts through out the map.the new update improved weapons, movement and all around smoothness of the game. i believe the biggest loss with the new update is the way you upgrade or customize your characters/equipment. it's not as easy as using experience from your games played. free game for me so i am not worried about that just the action with friends and the game playover all the game is awesome. action packed, best played with mic, friends and scopes.add me ramitinashol",1

8386,"personal score: 8 out of 10neverwinter, set in the dungeons and dragons universe, is one of my few favorite mmos. most of the quests are not the typical kill 10 rats and come back and see me type, sometimes you have to actually accomplish killing a boss as if you were a bounty hunter. secondly the keys you use in combat differ from most mmos out there, which makes you feel like you're drawn into the battles more. instead of using 1 thru 9 as your hotkeys, it's done through the q, e, and r keys, 1 and 2 serve as special attacks, while 3,4, and 5 allow you to add potions or whatnots on them. 7 controls your mount and tab allows you to access a special ability. while combat is straight-forward, you can didge attacks in this game, unlike most mmos where you keep clicking until you or your enemy is dead. the graphics seem a bit dated for being an mmo only opened a few years ago, and sometimes you may run into lag if there are too many users on the one and only server they have, but that's okay as far as i'm concerned, these are minor annoyances for me that can be easily overlooked. the other great feature is the foundry. the foundry is accessible after you reach level 15(?) with your in-game character, and it allows you to actually design quests for others to play in-game. so if you're a d&d lover, you can use that love to create quests others can enjoy. the only real downside is that this is a free mmo. this means they make their money through the item shop where you spend real cash for in-game items not found anywhere else. this may be terrible to some, but you can get through the game without using it. you just may not be able to craft a certain enchantment for your weapon or have the flashiest mount to ride on, or open enchantment boxes, but that's okay, because there is lots of stuff to do and see. grab a sword, cast a spell, and enjoy neverwinter... an mmo i highly recommend.",1

2111,"overview: path of exilethis game is technically an mmo, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. if it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. the gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).pros: 1) microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest. 2) character balance and variety. there are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just 2-3 use these or always lose web builds for op classes - from what i've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced.3) community. there are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. as always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people.4) audio. the ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour.5) details. the devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to 5 potions, which refill as you slay enemies. the game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.cons:1) repetition. although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. it's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant.2) actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. although boredom is a death sentence in most games, i think i'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily 20 hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point.",1

10490,"i gave this game a thumbs up, but this is a mixed review. i enjoyed the game immensely. however, i just don't enjoy it enough to pump funds into it. if it was a one time buy, then you're good to go, then i'd pay real money for it. but having to pay a subscription, i just don't get into it that much.now, as far as the game goes, it's very well done. you track animals and kill them. pretty simple. it's a little sci-fi, in a way, with your tracker. you see foot prints, your tracker will give you a cone of which direction the animal is heading. not too bad. but then you find droppings, and the tracker gives you a max range of how far they could have gone. now you have direction, and how far they could be. then, you hear a grunt, howl, cluck, etc, and the tracker pings your map exactly where the noise came from.now, if that's what you're into, that's fine. don't get me wrong, that last paragraph was not meant as a complaint, just information. i enjoy the tracker.the only thing i don't like about this game, is the recurring payments. you can hunt 3 types of animals for free indefinitely, mule deer, a type of rabbit, and something else i can't remember off the top of my head. you have to buy licenses to hunt anything else, or pay a subscription to unlock everything.it's free to try and hunt and see how the gameplay is, so there's no risk. you might as well try it to see if you're willing to pay money into it. worst case scenario is you waste some time and realize you don't want to pay.",1

15582,"(from pc and android)so ive expected this game since it was announced.can i recommend this game ? yes and no...ive played adventure time, dragon fable and adventure time world. all of em are awesome games and its nice to see everything 2d coming to life in 3d.but and its a big but. the game isnt finished i cant really say its even in open beta... too few locations only 3 starting classes excluding the guardian which is premium class. unneccesery crafting system that takes real time...aqw had crafting and it was fine and it didnt require waiting... the wait time is probably just to extend the game as much as possible at this stage. im kinda use to the game being unfinished cause i played in the unfinished (beta) version of aqw. still worlds had way more classes available at the beta phase more locations more quests everything more. for the time this game has been in development i expected a little more.this game is a good time waster tho, there isnt much you can do in the game at the moment but i expect a lot more content in the future. i expect this game to have the same amount of content as aqw cause that game is absolutly briliant. aq3d only has the name the feel the humor and its a true cross platform ( i play it on my phone ) a potato can run this game but thats all about it for it.it has stupid unneccesery crafting wait time and gear is focused more on grinding materials now (which isnt that bad)it has too few locations and key locations dont exist the town isnt even finished half of the buildings are still coming soon.back to my question do i reccoment it ? yes if you love adventure time and you are willing to waitno for the new players to aq games cause this is bare bones game with very little content at the moment ( just wait )go play aqw till this is finished.overall for this review ill say no.20/10/2016.",0

12141,"honest review: 7/10 - tl:dr - do recommend. my credentials (not bragging or showing i suck, just what i've done before)sc2 - master - 90% wol campaign achievements. wow - gladiator s2-s5 - 75% server first raid kills bc - wotlk - server top 10 level 70 and 80.destiny - full raid clears each dlc during their release. terrible in pvplol - platinum every season. 3500 normal wins 2500 dominion wins.d2 - 98 hc sorcerer. fortnite - i got a kill once.wildstar - max level medicplanet coaster - 450 hours playedso, i've had my way around a lot of video games. competitive and casual. that being said, bless online is good, and it can be great.negative - the game launched with speed (and i'm talking founders pack launch, because as soon as it's available to public, that's launch to me). servers sucked, instability was prime, i've played a ton of mmo's and other 'popular' online games. i'm used to this, i get it. get over online games launch crashes. i know it sucks, we are all hyped.positive - when you could play, it was fun. my favorite part of this game is the questing. and i hate questing. okay, it's not my favorite, but it's not miserable. the game helps you out so much with what to do. solely because of the auto path feature. what's that? it paths you, similar to rts style pathing. you click on an area (or use the quest guide) and it runs you to where you need to be by creating a path. you don't have to do this, but it's super nice. hey, i need to go over here. *hits auto path, alt tabs for a few minutes* oh cool, i arrived (or died). best feature in the game. it's what makes all the stupid bearable. negative - they nerfed the damage a lot. remember when i said the game launched with speed? well you could kill the average mob in about five seconds. i play the paladin, a healing class with the (probably) lowest damage output. this was nice. this was not the devs intention. i made it to level 30(?). they nerfed damage across the board. my paladin did 25% of the damage she did before. it made questing unbearable. and grouping up and sharing quests was a nightmare at the time. it was semi-buggy, kills didn't count toward each others quests, stuff like that. so they buffed xp gain a little. it was still bad. and i'm not complaining about the rate at which we are now leveling. i'm okay with the grind. i played wow during its vanilla days. i can get it can take eight hours to get a level. i'm cool with it. it just takes me, as a paladin, way too long to kill a mob. so i quest/grind four levels lower, where it only takes about ten seconds to kill a mob, ish. it's not fun. nerf hp to all pve mobs outside of dungeons by 50%, and nerf the xp to for all i care, that'd be fine. i'm okay with named mobs and specific mobs being hard, i'm about that. positive - mounts and pets. you tame them. you select your mount from the wild. that's cool. the mounts have abilities. it's random (ish). you level up mounts. they have energy that depletes and they need to rest (or be fed). you have to evolve them, or upgrade them. this is a chance feature, and not guaranteed. this sucks. it's a luck based mechanic, which is okay, but you have only so many chances to do this, per mount/pet. so this will be a super long grind to get the right companion for you, because it may not upgrade. maybe this will change a little bit, maybe not. this feature seems bogus. however, i'd rather have this than just oh look i have a mount now. negative - everything seems to be 'temporary'. how do i explain this? gathering plants and mining minerals. your pick has charges. it goes away after an hour, or so many uses, depending on what you buy. with my founders pack, my items are good for a month (infinite uses). this comes with premium (the monthly sub). also, durability reduction can be permanent. 40/40 on my weapon. ten hours later, after being repaired a few times, 34/34. i think this can be fixed, i'm not that far in the game yet. just seems tedious. which brings me to the next thing:positive (but barely) - premium. if i am going to play a game, i don't mind paying for it. i don't mind investing in it. i like the sub idea. i like the sub idea being optional. you get better quality from a game if it is constantly making revenue. my best example: ps3 vs xbox 360. i am a playstation guy. i like both, i have both (one and ps4), but i like ps better. however, xbox live was wayyy better than psn (before the psn+ being required for almost everything). it was more stable, the matchmaking was better, it worked so much smoother. it's because people payed for it, so they kept working on it and improving it. psn was free, and acted like it. it sucked. it was unstable and poorly set up. that being said, i'm okay with micro-transactions and/or subscription fees. i don't know how pay2win this game will be yet, but it is slightly. premium is worth it. if you're too cheap to sub to an online game (be it any online game), that's okay! don't complain about a measly 15 bucks a month. mmos you play a lot. pay for it. that's how they work. that's how the better ones endure. that's how they get better. yes, you buy the game. you keep paying for the game to grow and get better. that's why people are not still playing ffx but are still playing wow. this can go either way (+/-), but any game that is making many has a way better chance of getting better and staying a good game than games that don't. positive - the game itself. the combo combat system. the unique spells. it's another mmorpg. i l like it. the talent tree like system is weird, i'm not a fan, but whatever. it's fun, it's kind of pretty. it's very bland as there are not a lot of extras in the game, only the necessity right now, which i don't care about. it's a fun mmorpg, gripes aside. i'm enjoying it. 60 hours in 7 days, playing fairly casually. less than a dollar an hour. i'm happy with it. these are the big things about the game that would tip me either direction on the game. i haven't covered everything, nobody ever will. it's an mmo with a lot to do. the devs are making update daily, some liked and some disliked. they have an idea for their game. be patient. insert your opinion, let it be heard, but don't say this game isn't worth it because of an update you didn't like. mmos are a longevity game. you play them for weeks/months/years, not two days. play the game for a week before you decide to tell people not to play it. say it's not for you, don't say it's not for them because you didn't like the patch the day it came out. .again: 7/10, on the path to being better, a lot of potential to be better, but it's not bad as it is.",1
168,"holy hell! give this thing your full attention if you are at all interested in the horror genre. despite the name, the game is only sparsely reliant on simple jump scares and instead paints a truly horrific atmosphere of dread, tension and tongue-and-cheek satire. it's a really good sign when you're on pins and needles at the mere prospect of opening a door. i found this one thoroughly difficult to put down for long. seriously, this programmer deserves a friggin' medal!--plus, the low res graphics make the visuals doubly creepy. bonus!",1

16966,"cuisine royale is a parody game of most battle royale games out there. despite being a parody, it's actually one of the best battle royale games. i've played fortnite, pubg, and some other battle royale games. despite that fact, i still think this is the best battle royale game out there.the art style is great. as a history lover, me and my friends all like the wwii setting and it's good to see what the game they're working on will become. the way the animations work is hilarious and goofy, purposefully, is great and it fits the design perfectly. the idea of protecting yourself with kitchen gear as a man in his underpants is comedic, and definately helps the game show it's a joke game.even though it's a parody, it's better than pubg. the gameplay is great, and is way faster than pubg, and is less boring. a cuisine royale match takes 1/4 of the time that a pubg match does, and you'll have more fun playing it. the game is fast-paced and gets your blood pumping, and it's realistic style helps it's surreal atmosphere. the gunplay is pretty solid except for some rather questionable times, and it remains to be fun even after multiple matches.in total, the game is great and i think it plays really well. with the ability to play squads and duos, it's really good to play with my friends and we love this quirky game. i would recommend getting it before it becomes paid.",1

4082,"it's time to duel! yu-gi-oh! duel links is a mobile game that was port to pc. it reminded me of the nostalgia when i was playing with their trading cards using the original playing mat. luckily, konami decided to simplify the game by decreasing it from the original game to just three spaces per monster and spell/trap cards. the minimization, as well as the automated duel options, is an excellent investment to play the game while saving time. most of the time auto duel will result in wins when battling npc duelist under level 40. above level 40, it's better to duel manually. additionally, auto duel does have a problem with unique decks, but as long as you use a standard deck, auto duel will usually get things right. yu-gi-oh! duel links is very addicting, and it can be a timesink. it has a feeling of one more turn where you would like to continue playing the game on and on. nevertheless, there is a limit to the number of npc duelist available at any set times, so it provides a way to limit players being glued to playing this game. multiplayer is satisfactory, but since each players' decks are different, there are numerous strategies to use to win a duel.games like yu-gi-oh! duel links are best suited for on-the-go gaming. there's a lack of stories and any essential backdrop to what you are trying to achieve in-game, but dueling to be the king of games will be sufficient for most users. i recommend that you try it out on pc, but if you planned to play long term, it's best to stick to the mobile version.",1

26246,"this is a very complex issue. i think we should avoid blanket statements like that.it might be because our society has simultaneously created a culture that encourages men to exert power and demands them to be successful sexually, as well as created a group of men with little to no contact with women in general.in online games specifically this behaviour has been around for decades and is widely accepted and perpetuated because people will follow the majority. if young men are used to their peers treating women around them badly, they will pick up that attitude. it's like in school when a group of kids will be led by one or two people to be loud and obnoxious, but if you remove the leader they may be perfectly nice.a lot of us will do as the people around us do. it's peer pressure. if your friends catchall girls on the street, odds are you'd feel pressured to join, because you want to fit in. to be one of the boys. and when this becomes a widespread thing lots of men don't know, or don't think about, the damage they are doing.most people are decent people. it only takes a bad environment and a reason to disregard the outgroup to twist someone into behaving badly.",1

3293,"for a f2p battle royale, this has a surprising amount of polish and is surprisingly fun.before getting into the game itself, you have an indepth character customization system that allows you to very slightly change the way your character looks. unfortunately, you can't make your character look not asian which is a bit disappointing. you also have cosmetics which you can unlock using crates that you can purchase pubg style without the need for keys. these crates can be purchased with the credits you earn by playing the game.let me say that this is one of the more fun oriented battle royale games. aside from your standard battle royale fare, you can also do any of the following; go snowboarding, climb mountains, paraglide, drive monster trucks, drive snowmobiles, ride trams, and go sailing. when you find yourself in those boring moments moving between areas, you might be able to get the chance to do any of these things.into the game itself, you can spawn wherever you like without the fear of someone nailing you immediately, unless you choose to spawn right beside someone else on the map. once you take the spot, the spot is yours and yours only. personally, i don't care too much for this since i enjoy the surprise encounters and bloody deathmatches that comes with the classic battle royale formula of parachuting onto your spot of choice. however, it makes sense within the context of the game's lore where you're a tourist trying to escape a deadly snowstorm.the gameplay is very solid, but does need improvements. each type of weapon has its strengths and weaknesses. smg's are extremely powerful close range, rifles are best suited for mid-range, snipers for long range, and shotguns to make close quarter combat situations end quickly. the balance is lost due to how the weapons work. most importantly, the mp5 and the mpx are stupidly powerful. if you or someone else were to go up against another player in a close or mid range combat situation, the smg will most certainly win. with full armor, the mp5 or mpx can take someone down much more quickly than with a rifle. the smg's lack of recoil also makes it superior in mid-range combat situations since it doesn't appear to have any damage drop off from a distance. this dominance by the smg's make the rifle class weapons the most suitable one at very specific ranges, or for picking at moving targets from a long distance. i'm not a fan of rifles not objectively being the best weapon in the game, but if i were to play devil's advocate, i'd say it makes the game more balanced and encourages players to have all of their weapon slots filled up with a close, mid range, and long range weapon.although the game has many of its own features, it does lack a few others, such as upgradable inventory space, free leaning, being able to look around while running, and others i can't quite think of at the moment. the way the map shrinks is also strange, instead of having a big circle it takes specifically outlined pieces of the game world to become danger zones. while i might prefer more traditional battle royale game design, roe's take on the genre helps it stand out of the crowd when it comes to its core gameplay.which, speaking of gameplay, is something i have come to like a lot. it's not as tactical as pubg or as arcadey as fortnite, but it offers a fine balance between the two. it manages to juggle fun game concepts while providing competition worthy movement and shooting mechanics. if there's anything to criticize, its the way recoil works. maybe it's because i've only spent ten hours in the game so far, but the mechanics of controlling recoil doesn't seem to be clear aside from simply tapping the fire button to keep one's accuracy, which even pubg doesn't force players to deal with.the map itself is very well designed, probably the best designed br map i've ever gotten to play on. each location on the map is intricately designed to utilize the three 'classes' in the game; the hang glider, the snow boarder, and the rock climber. there are many inclines to snowboard from as well as mountains and buildings to climb or hang glide from. the varying areas also have their own identity. while games like pubg and fortnite will reuse buildings and assets, the different areas will, more often than not, have sections where most buildings are completely unique from the rest of the game world. as i've stated before, moving around in the game is much less of a drag considering the many ways of travel i've listed in the game.lastly, being an early access game, the netcode and polish this game has surpasses pubg by a large margin. i've probably ran into maybe two bugs and one moment where i felt like a shot i fired off should have hit when it didn't, whereas pubg feels more like eurojank despite it being developed in the usa and korea. so far i'm very impressed with how smoothly the game runs and i have high hopes for the game's success.this is a battle royale i feel has not only a very unique identity, but is also a very fun take on the genre compared to its slower, more tactical counterparts, while still retaining serious competitive aspects that more casual br games don't posess.it's free. play it.",1

14377,"the game was a lot better back in 2014 but the development team are amatuers at best. failure to learn from their mistakes (and there are many) which has been proven again and again over the 2 years of updates i've suffered playing this game.match making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players. the outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design. the problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in 2015 (battle arena update) which broke the game (overclocking mechanic) and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times. the removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system, just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together. this relates to the poor match making.mega bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them. mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve.failure to add key features for the community like clans (this could make the game if they bothered to implement it)they treat the players/customers with little consideration when they release major changes. often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws.they only care about new players who spend real money. membership exists but it offers such poor value i suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer. if you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year. spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility.the most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item. the items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price. effectively you can grind the free to play model, convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crates/items for real money at extortionate rates. they have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players. this game is now looking more like 'free to install' and 'pay to compete'",0

17213,"free to pay!as much as i'd like to love this game (because i love the movies), i just can't. the game falls very short in my opinion for two main reasons. the first is that at times the controls can be frustratingly cumbersome, especially during flight. sometimes it takes a while to register a turn or boost, but maybe this is just due to timing.the second is that you're bombarded with advertisements for membership, additional perks and boosts, which i'm really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself. i don't mind a bit of advertising; these, however, are in your face, particularly on the loading screens, which i like to contain useful in-game information, such as hints or history.there's nothing wrong with micro-purchasing in a game. it's down to how well it's presented that counts and, unfortunately, it seems that a lot of the items or areas are unlockable only if you pay, thereby limiting the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore. while you can explore freely to an extent, it's pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next.one good thing about the game is that you can choose between solo and multiplayer, but after awhile it becomes samey and i quickly lost interest. sad because it has the potential to be a great game.",0

2498,"it has turned so much worse over the last 2 years.i joined the game before 2014.the game was fun in the begining...at first i said to myself:'well, i'll wait until i figured out how to play properly before eventually paying some bucks for a premium account.but soon i got it: gaijin just wants user to pay for premium vehicles or quick-repairs (prem. account)... without any benefit from it. a prem. account just means you can place more badges to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lions after a match, (= in-game-money to pay your repairs if you get shot).that's what i'd call 'free to play - pay to win'. special ammo or repairs will cost you silver lions so basically real money.if you really are mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assured: you'll get affronted to the fact that russian vehicles (planes or tanks) are the greatest in the world. no1 one can defeat their armor or aigility. is this true? i can't find any wiki article that confrims that russian technique was outstanding back in the days. it was unreliable and let's say: their planes were bad compared german planes.that's why i'd call the dev's: liars. but wait... there's even more:gaijin is just announcing new stuff, which is incompletely developed and balanced.old issues about bad balancing and bad realism aren't corrected. the only thing you'll feel in newer versions of the game is that russian vehicles are getting stronger...to my mind, this game is basically a russian propaganda machine.. and about the worst issue:gaijin claims that there ain't no cheaters in the game it is not possible, they say that everything regarding balancing is calculated by the servers.well... dozens of youtube videos prove that - yes it is true, there are cheaters.so my conclusion: gaijin is just another software company with the objective to gain money. but in this case, they lie to their community in every respect. they don't wanna care about fair -play (avoiding cheats) or realism.don't waste your time.",0

9229,"having only put 20 hours into this game, i thoroughly enjoy planetside 2. if you're into a more futuristic fps, then this game is right up your alley. i love the big battles that you can get into sometimes. i also like the 3 different factions, although i feel the new conglomerate is underpowered at times. i've only played as the new conglomerate and the vanu sovereignty, but i enjoy playing as them (maybe the vanu sovereignty more :). the gameplay feels authentic sometimes. there's just a thrill that you get from the constant explosions all around and bullets whizzing past. the one problem that i have with this game is the grind. it takes a long time to get enough certs to buy what you want, and then get them all back by grinding again just to get another item that you want. planetside does have a membership that you can pay to get more xp and certs, but you don't need to necessarily buy it unless you don't have enough time to grind. this game isn't pay to win, most of the items that cost currency that you can buy are just cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon skins, voice packs, etc. all in all, i do believe that planetside 2 is a great game that everyone should give a try, and then put an hour or so into the game and see how you feel after that. i hope this review interested you in trying out planetside 2. thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. :)",1

2178,"behind my steam hours there's probably 500-1000 more from beta days. i've been terribly addicted to this game and i like the rng touch as well as the superior character planning that's available. the only negative i can find is that the rng can sometimes drive you a bit mad. also if you're not smart with your currency you can end up feeling fairly frustrated. you need to study the player economy and builds as you play to have the most fun as i've experienced, and it's not really that hard. also it's a free-to-play game with full access to all content on just clicking the install button, so the business model is great. new content is flowing in like diarrhoea from a sphincterless step child, so that's a big plus as well. definitely worth the install and to keep to content coming i'd recommend chipping in a few microtransactions or a pack as well!",1
5504,"for a free game, world of tanks is a lot of fun. no transactions are really required and there isn't a paywall to prevent those who didn't pay anything from being competitive. occasionally, competition can be annoying when your team doesn't really care or one of the players on your team go mia on you. there is also a lot of grinding after a certain tier which can be frustrating when you've had a long lose streaks. if you don't like ginding by yourself the best way to play this game is to drag in a few friends with you. the moment i started learning from my mistakes and started grinding with friends, my gameplay got a lot better and i started enjoying myself more. great game for its price!",1

9198,"for a f2p fps mmo game, planetside 2 hits the nail right on the head. it is essentially tf2 except on a massive scale (when i say massive i mean massive. think of a map as big as a free roam rpg.) with vehicles, more players and endless fun. i never played the original, but this would probably be better. it is also a first person shooter.it is a hard thing to review planetside 2. there is just so much content. we'll star with the good:the good:the map size is massive! a whole continent. and not just one continent. three! with another one releasin in april 2014. every inch of the map is accessible if you have the right equipment. from the sweeping planes, mountains and desert of indar, to the barren and snow swept continent of esamir, with its huge craggy purple things and plains of snow, to the lush forest of amerish, with its trees, grass and mountains. there are three different factions to choose from: the glorious terran republic (my personal favourite), the xeno-tech worshiping turds of the vanu soverignty, the rebels dogs of the new conglomerate. if you want more about each of the factions, here is a link: there are five classes to chose from in planetside 2: the infiltrator who handles sniping and sneaking. the light assault who flies around the battlefield with his jetpack. the heavy assault who just shoots stuff with a huge amount of ammo and has heavy armour. the combat medic. he (or she doesn't matter) heals allies and shoots stuff if they get in his way. the engineer who repairs vehicles, sports the same weapons of the light assault. there is one last thing i have to mention on the classes: the max! this is just a smaller mech. he has two mounted weapons, huge amounts of health and a high kill rate. engineers heal him and medics revive him.the amount of players. you need lots of people to fill up a large map right? well here we have hunrdreds of players per side! and if you are lucky enough you may get a three-way battle.finally, the vehicles. you can use vehicles like the flash and the harrasser to get around the map fast. things like tanks steam-roll anyone who gets in their way. planes can get you around, destroyand be mobile spawn sites. sunderes on the gorund can also be a moblie spawn site.the bad: the lag. do not play if you do not have a good internet connection!!! there is so much lag if you dont have a good connection speed. it makes the game a horror to play.sometimes other player are real dip. they team kill you, run you over and scream and swear a lot! there are also a huge amount of micro-transactions. like for weapons (you can buy them with ingame money as well, but it takes for ever to get a good one). they are also for vehicles and aircraft. but this is not that bad as you can buy the station cash (micro-transaction money) with steam credit.also, there is a glitch that i experience when if i log off to play another game and i come back later, i can't log on! not sure if i'm the only one though... but if anyone else experiences it, please tell me!rant ended.conclusion:all in all this game is awesome and you should really get it. there really is no reason not to since it is free. 7 out of ten!",1

2013,"stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. path of exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. no pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. path of exile was meant to be the diablo 2 successor that i've always dreamed of... but is it?the first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. the character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true diablo formula. there's plenty of strategy to implement here. i thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.but where did it all go wrong?the second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. cruel difficulty is terribly unbalanced. you will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. this function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience. grinding gear games didn't get the memo, it seems. regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and cruel penalties. my desire to play was crushed once i was met with this awful formula. as an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.due to this massive difficulty boost, you require a build to survive. there is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional mmo). it essentially becomes a game like dark souls - a game for masochists. a game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. to even scrape by.these are the reasons why i do not recommend this game. the beginning showed lots of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. there's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the dark souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.thankfully, i didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. i hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0

9138,"great game that a player can get a lot of 'free' fun fragging out of.to a new player this game can be a bit daunting and farming certs (at first) comes slow and turns many away.to gain certs faster (at first) you need to be an engi/med, stack your ability to gain more certs by spending certs in things that help others, forget weapons at first, if you work on your repair tool, ammo giving, health/shield giving, remote repping/ammo in a sundi while acting as a passive mobile medic for people close to your vehicle etc. maybe spend a few certs on a scope if you find time to use it.join a platoon/squad and actually fight with them as support and your +% bonus to certs increases giving you more certs. joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you. personally i think that is a bit lame, however you want certs and being in a constant battle is the best way to earn them.it is a hard slog at first and i made it harder by buying a gun for 1k certs when i could have increased my passive cert making skills as above, now however i make so much passive certs using engi/med with little work that i have 1k certs to spend on guns etc every couple of days.i have never spent a penny on this game, some customisations are given to the non spenders like me, such as the big christmas bow and the salty paintjob etc.there is a lot more to say about this game, such as the huge maps and battles that push front lines back and forth for hours whilst trying to outflank the opposing force. it is f2p, give it a go.",1

2559,"this post is mainly for the most recent event where players were told they could win an e-100 premium german tank. here's a few reasons on how gaijin royally screwed up, as they have done so many times before. you have to play russia to win. i payed $10.00 for a dog tag to gain access into the thunder league to play the event. i was excited at first, in fact my first few games were goign well. we won more than we lost and even the losses weren't that bad because you could hop back in right after the game was over and try again. so thus day one ended and i placed 587, (you have to be in the top 150 to get the tank). so not bad, i'm thinking that i have all day sunday to improve my ranking. this is where gaijin, once again, screwed over its players and community. i logged back into war thunder to participate in the event. i like the american line and had been using my m46 tiger and m26 pershing the day before. i get into the event and my tanks aren't there. what? instead, there is the m4a3 series of tanks such as the e2 jumbo and the premium calliope. so i go out in the jumbo and we are paying against 2 is2's and a t34-85. i get one-shotted 3 times and our team loses. no one on the enemy team loses a life. and it's not just this way for america, no. all countries are set to certain tanks to make the game more fair so in other words, one has to play the russian line to even have a shot at gettign kills because everyone who plays war thunder knows, russian tanks are op.so needless to say i had gone 24 wins and 8 losses the day before to 10 straight losses in a row with the same team the next because we could not kill the russians unless we played as the russians. and since i don't prefer to play the russian line, and enjoy my americans, this really blew. so thank you gaijin for once again trying to balance a game and making it worse. this hasn't only happened this one time but many others, i guess this was the final straw.",0

2262,"having an *ahem* history with diablo 2 lod, i was preparing very hard to be disappointed here. i'm very specific about what i enjoy in arpg's, but this definitely delivers on all the fronts that i've come to like. the maps are repetitive but random (this is a good thing) and there is an obscene amount of loot to find. the currency system is different, but better (i remember vividly how useless gold was in d2 - no more). the passive tree isn't very intuitive (if you want a competitive character, that is), but it does offer a lot of potential for theorycrafting if that is what you enjoy. as far as i can tell the classic arpg class niches have all been nicely filled. if you don't feel like theorycrafting, there's an active forum community (official forums, obviously - not the steam ones) that probably has a guide for the thing that you want to play somewhere. if you're looking for diablo 2, but not diablo 2 itself, you will like this.",1

9084,"planetside 2 is a very interesting f2p mmofps. if there was a mixed review option, this is where i would use it. but now looking back towards its first year when it launched (which you can find the player counts here[steamcharts.com]) compared to what it is now, i simply can't recommend this game anymore due to not having that much of a stable playerbase anymore. as usual with (somewhat) older games, the more skilled players only tend to play the game now with the acception of newer players trying it out. i've known numerous players who want to get into the game yet struggle when the veteran players seems to dominate in every way possible. take quake live for example, the small community there tends to just be veterans of the game which makes it very hard for people to get into the game.but not everyone is like that, though. i have myself for that example as i started playing ps2 halfway through its lifespan before quitting around br55-65. thus meaning it is very much possible to catch up to higher skilled players. this isn't including how oddly optimized this game is as it seems to bottleneck or straight up lag most of the time unless you have an extremely overkill computer.tl;dr low player base, sluggish optimization, and not a very easy game to get into (for most).",0

(while it could be better priced),... ok and do-able, though i haven't bought it yet [everything is included in the pack]. now your free to start playing / so-called pay to 2 win game can be just a paid for game, with full content. so, yes! i'm wanting to buy the game. i'm just saying all this imo. i think that what makes a p2w game is when getting certain paid content delivers a big advantage over f2p players, and when that certain paid content is unreasonably expensive. but, once again, this all mopogood job, sector 3 studios/simbin studios!",1

13191,"i'd like to give this a neutral review but since that's not an option, i'll give a slight recommendation.first, i'd like to address the elephant in the room. this game was originally developed for tablet, which, as you should know, means that if you expect a real game, you're gonna be disappointed. if you want a real game that you can play for at least two to five hours without taking a break or getting bored, you may wanna take a look at sheltered or something similar. generally, it's a good idea to stay away from f2p or tablet games if you want a real game. also, obviously, the controls are mediocre at best and annoying at worst, it really shows that it wasn't originally designed for pc.ok, now that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review part. the core gameplay mechanics seem pretty generic, as it can be expected from a f2p game. that's not really a bad thing though since it's basically a waiting game which means it is expected to deal with pretty basic mechanics. click on things to collect resources and items, click on people to let them level up, and so on. if you want to loose, you have to try very hard (if it's even possible to let everyone in your vault die, unless you play on survival), if you want to win you have to spend money or play for a very long time (what i mean by winning is having built everything that you want to build). nothing new.the game will continue to run if you are logged out, and obviously while you're not online, you won't be able to collect anything. that is also not really bad though because after a short while, the resource consumption will be halted. so you will have a little less resources when you log back in but they won't be completely depleted.generally, if you don't want to spend money on it, it seems to be a good idea to just log in every couple of hours, collect everything, send some people on quests, start a new weapon/armor production, maybe use speed-mode a couple of times to get a few caps and fill your resource-storage faster and once everything seems good, you can log out again. just don't forget to check your statistics-screen every once in a while, to make sure that your production per minute is still higher than your consumption per minute.also, there are a couple bugs, crashes and other issues. if you decide to play this game, maybe you have already played some early access titles where the developers simply stopped to care and never fixed any bugs or anything? this game will remind you of that. there is absolutely no communication from the developer, certain bugs have been known for years but no one cared enough to fix them. after a simple look at the discussions you will also probably find that you shouldn't get too attatched to your vault and definitely shouldn't spend any money on it. almost every day i looked, there has been at least one thread on front page complaining about the game being unplayable due to crashes/freezes/etc or the save file being corrupted/disappeared. so it definitely is a bit of a gamble.if everything works and you are lucky enough to not run into any game breaking bugs it can be fun but that is definitely not guaranteed. so if you like waiting games you can definitely give it a try but i would strongly suggest to not support the developer by buying anything in this game until they start to care a little bit more and fix bugs and other problems.",0

5483,"this is a fun game! lots of action with room for growth and expertise. if you like to excel, you can develop your tanks and get better! but, that's where it ends unless you pay the cash!!!. you will find that many times, round after round, that you will be deluged with opponents who are much faster in speed, even though your ranked with the same categories. their armor seems to be thicker, take multiple hits, up into the teens, where you can get destroyed with one to three hits by ammunition that is more powerful! bought with gold i'm sure. it isn't hard to realize these have been purchased, where your side doesn't have overwhelming attack capabilities!!! there is a lot of dissension on the discussion boards about this. some say that more skill is needed. when you find yourself losing with 6 to 7 opponent tanks standing to none on your side on many, many, many occasions. it is not hard to realize that this game is designed to cause fraustration so that you can get your mommy to buy you a $100.00 tank!! it's all designed to manipulate people to pay money for this game. an if you show negativity, they will let you know! the game is biased for a reason!! i play it, but i'm getting so tired of one-sided battles! over and over and over again, then you get matched with equals and it is a lot of fun, but trust me it won't last! the store bought tanks always are ranked against you again. overall, i give this a thumbs down!! it's a shame, because it could really be a great game!!",0

14446,"just quoting another review i totaly agree with. stay away from this game. simply put, the development team (freejam) is utterly incompetent. there have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). instead, freejam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. this accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, freejam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.other major issues with the game:1) building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. in fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, freejam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did because freejam said so.2) significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. simply put, freejam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. in the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. there are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). 3) freejam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. they won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. instead, freejam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. things like clans have been on freejam's radar since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. the sad part is, by the time freejam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. 4) minimal skill required. if you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. freejam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. this might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.freejam: one step forward, two steps back. always.",0

2880,"product received for freeokay after 570 hours in the game i recommend the out of this game. if that didnt get you to install war thunder, then install war thunder you fool. it's a free game so why not ? well one reason not to is because you will get so addicted to it you will litterally forget the name world of tanks. it completely overshadows wargaming in every way, and now with the 1.77 patch i can safely say it is one of not the best games i have ever played. okay i mentioned why you should get the game, now time for the juicy inside scoop of what comes after. well my freind, you have much more than a random number generator with health bars. that it's competitor provides... this game uses a full indepth x-ray modular system where every shot counts. shoot the driver and that tank can't go anywhere until he is replaced, but be carefull he can still shoot back. way better than a health bar. now take that idea and expand it to the whole tank, then add in differant shells like high explosive that don't penetrate the tank but give the enemy crew a bad headache, and worse if the crew aren't hidden behind armour. high explosive anti tank that the germens use, litterally oneshots everything and good at range but expensive.so if the gameplay's good, graphics ? well it's not next gen, but u don't need next gen in a competative environment, u need framerate, and trust me the options always allow you to have a great framerate with great graphics. although it won't look that great like modern titles if you don't have a monster pc, your in the heat of battle and won't look at the small details when ur panicing that, that guy over there just set you on fire.well, did i mention this game is tanks, planes aaand ships ? well now i did ... think of it as a mega wargaming u as a world of tanks / warplanes and / warships. it completes the 3 battle princaple of air, ground and sea and it comes together perfectly. as in applejacks words, think of a ww2 simulator game as a apple pie, you can have amazing apples, and a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together can you have a perfect apple pie.so it's got ww2 ships planes and tanks. that all ? nope. there are pre war tanks that you start with, and cold war behemoths. this game spans are large time period and when you think you've got a amazing tank, it get's better.but be warned, this game isn't balanced, no not in the slightest. despite gaijin's best attempts, at the moment, certain machines stand out at their ranks. but just like real life some may say. well i agree a little, there's a way arround these players with a unfair advantage. outsmart them. but you can't most of the time so that annoys me too. i can't play with freinds on this game for long periods of time because they get so angry and just ragequit.",1
11057,awesome! ive been playing ccg for about 20 years of my life. its absolutely the best collecting card game right now!!! no p2w and tons of different individual strategies.,1
8970,"after having played +300 hours i can say that this is most likely the best f2p shooter ever created so far. the easiest comparison is with battlefield. it's pretty much battlefield in a sci-fi setting and huuuge! each of the current four continents spans 64 square kilometers with many bases and outposts ranging from small forward outposts to large tech plants. combine this with a unique look to each continent plus three factions longing for control over the territory, most of the time having two or more fronts to battle at, and very good game balancing and you get planetside 2.the only real downside to the game are the required system specs. the game is pretty performance-hungry, but the devs are working in improving the games performance constantly.if you're not a lone wolf type of player you might want to grab some friends or find an outfit to roll with tho, because there's only so much you can do by yourself. sometimes a coordinated air raid or tank convoy is the thing you need and you can't do this as effectively when you're alone.",1
5364,"it's a very addictive and immersive game. it requires strategic thinking and pre-planning. gameplay is relatively well balanced. it would be better if you could enable better graphics on win10 versions, similar to the pc version.",1
4900,"i've played over 1,500 hours of smite before the steam release and i could play 1,500 more. this game in a short summary is the most skilled moba you will ever play, nothing is an auto lock ability and auto attacks even take skill to hit.pros and cons:pros: -multiple gamemodes for different types of players (you don't ever have to play the classic 3 lane map if you don't want).-all gods are usable, meaning that no ones is complete garbage and you will be shunned or hated on for using him.-the meta is constantly changing, always keeping laning and jungling fresh.-every god can be used in every lane if you are good enough, and no one will be mad if you do use a tank in mid lane.-the store currency to buy skins can be obtained through special events and through weekly awards, meaning if you are patient enough, you can get a skin you want.-game is completely free to play, you will never have to spend money on it if you don't want to.___cons: -all new gods on release are either: 1. completely broken and will infinently destroy you, or 2. super garbage and need a buff immediatly.-some gods are better than others, such as bellona, au puch and khepri, and hi-rez won't balance them.-servers are constantly kicking you out of games and going offline randomly.-community is very toxic, luckily you can mute people though.-if someone does something wrong, jungle always gets blamed, so you better be damn good at jungle unless you want to get roasted hard core.-game does not have an in-game voice chat, you have to download an external client called curse to talk to people in league matches.-favor (the in-game currency to buy gods) is extremely hard to obtain, making you want to buy the godpack more and more so you don't have to deal with trying to get it.___overall, this is my most played and favorite game of all time, and i most likely will never stop playing it, no matter how unbalanced bellona is.overall rating for smite: 9.25/10",1
6864,"i tried to like this game.i tried so hard to like this game.but i can't.think of it like this. it's planetside 2, but in a wwii setting. so if you hated pl2, you'll hate this game.as soon as you hit rank 3 with any faction, you get completely ed by the game.matchmaking suddenly becomes a broken mess, people are one-shoting you from across the map with tanks, you get bombed on by planes who fly so close to the ground in reality the bomb should have blown them up as well, you can't dobecause your being spawncamped, you shoot a guy 3 times in the torso with a semi-automatic rifle only for him to one-shot you with a bolt action, ect.as soon as i hit rank 3, i was like alright! i can drive tanks! i can do assault maps! yes!i was playing as an american soldier, and the first tank they give dosen't even have a ing cannon on it. no, it has 2 useless mg's on it that can't doto other tanks. why the would you give us a tank that you can't even fight other tanks with it? whats the ing point of a tank if it doesn't have a cannon on it? it might as well be a slow jeep with 2 mg's on it at that rate. not to mention that each mg can only move 180 degrees, so to aim at someone to your right, you gota either hope you have a gunner with who or you gotta turn the clunky piece ofaround, and by that point your blown up.did i mention matchmaking? holy it gets so broken when any faction gets to rank 3. tired of being an american soildier whos rank 5? go switch to your german soilder whos rank 1, whoops put you in a game with a bunch of rank 8-15's, have fun .i should probably mention, you have to rank each faction individually. but for some stupid ing reason, as soon as one faction reaches rank 3, the other 2 factions get the benefits of hitting rank 3 even though they could both be untouched. because everyone ranks on their own, you have to deal with the starting equipment and ribons and medals all over again with each faction, only adding to the grind this game presents.this may be because i'm not a patient person to begin with, but this game is so ing broken due to it's matchmaking and utter grindy-ness for each faction, that i can't recomend this to anyone.unless you played this when it first came out and you're all geared up and whatever, get ready for this game to shove a 10 foot pole up your and then shove a 20 foot pole into yourwhile the 10 foot pole is still in there.",0
15698,great game so far has the start of alot of great story arcs but it is in open beta as of this review so content is still sparce. but this company is known for keeping it's promised content so it will get bigger and better with time just like all their other games and i for one want to support their branching into new platforms.,1
5375,"i have been playing this game for almost 2 years iirc, it's a good free to play game if you don't mind the grind or you can spend real money to buy premium tanks and advance tier.the problem nowadays is that this game is filled with clueless players in high tier (ix-x) to be enjoyable anymore.the grind to reach the high tier is no longer worth it as you will encounter worse match ups/players in tier ix/x compared to the lower tiers and most of the time you will have to carry the whole team to win the match.it has been a good experience while it lasts, but wg has failed to provide a fun, balanced gameplay.",0

8637,"alright here's the deal with these battle royale games ~are you tired of constantly praying that your opponent doesn't know how to build a skyscraper in half of a second?~how about going through that awkward boring moment when you have to walk a century in order to reach the circle on the other side of the map?~have you finally realized that you can't play pubg and fortnite for the rest of your life?~need a new refreshing game that you want to get addicted to?guess what, realm royale is your solution. what makes this game different? -good question, realm royale implement's a class system where you can choose from 5 classes; warrior, engineer, assassin, mage, and hunter. each class has their own unique skll set creating several combinations that can be used to your advantage, creating more variety. expect the list of classes expanding as development continues. -when you die you will transform into a chicken where you must stay alive as a chicken for 30 seconds until you can have another chance of living. something about killing chickens is always satisying and fun to do. -at any time you can press z to summon your mount that you can elegantly ride across the map that is made up of several different biomes. in each of these biomes you will find a forge.-at these forges you will be able to craft either potions, legendary armor, abilities or your class specific weapon. -but hold it there, you didn't think you would get all this great loot for free did you? of course you didn't. you spend your shards that you create when destroying any loot you find you don't want. you will find a lot of that. -did i mention that you directly dive onto the map? yeah that right, cut the parachute. this game wants you to dive straight into action, cut the bs. - i can't forget the fact that there is no fall damage. that's right, you can finally jump from more than 20 ft and not take any fall damage. might i add that you feel quite heroic when jumping from great heights.-we're all familiar with that experience of running out of ammo mid-fight, well guess what. that will never happen in this game since you have unlimited. -keep in mind that this game is very early in development as of right now and there will be even more features added and improved upon as time goes on. to sum it up realm royale has an incredible amount of potential. out of all the br games, this one is definitely the most arcade-y. it's a lot of fun and if hi-rez doesn't screw this up horrendously it will be able to compete with it's competitors. i am really excited to see how creative hi-rez can make this game. give it a try and stop believing that just because it looks similar to other games it's automatically terrible. it's not. realm royale gives it's own unque spin to the battle royale genre and it clicks. now take a breath and go download the game, i have to go back to dumping more hours into this game. i will see your chicken on the battlefield.",1

1736,"i started off hating this game due to its massive learning curve, and quite frankly that is a good thing to hate about it, some people don't want to dedicate a lot time of to one game, that's understandable.i put 10-15hrs into it across a few weeks and then uninstalled it.a year later i jump back into the game and gave it an actual try.they added a tutorial, after i finished that; learning a few things along the way, i starting playing easy bot practices with a few easier heroes.the game's less complicated than it is on surface, once you get going certain things quickly become easier, however certain things take a long time to learn which is where its learning curve comes into play.that's where a lot of people (including myself at a point) are put off by this game, lol is an easier alternative.but once you break past those first few (horrible, death filled) matches of you being confused as hell and making a ton of mistakes the game really starts to shine.you see the depth the game contains, the tactics.you start to get sucked in (if you're anything like me.)you start finding heroes that suit your tastes.that is where the game shines.once you've put about 30hrs in you're probably bored of bot matches, so public matches here you come.this is where the game is the best, and also where it's the worst.the game can get very intense, if you're with the right people; a lot of teamwork will come into play.but (especially for a newbie) this is where the game is at it's worst.the community in this game is among the worst i've ever seen.you will be yelled at for making minor (or major) mistakes, for some reason they don't realise you're new, and they were to at some point.you have to start somewhere with dota, so with all of the above in mind, do you want to start?",1
5835,"hello,this game is a piece of art. some say it is the best mil avio sim there is out there. even with its free module you will find yourself capapble of doing many tasks and missions (using the wide weaponary). but don't think you will be able to hop in the game and start doing all the ace manuevers and tactics. you will have to put your mind to it and approach it with the atitude of learning new stuff. game is in no mean necessary to be played as if you are a real pilot. you can take it casualy, but you will still need to take notes and be patient. the feeling of reward after succeding is huge. after you master the frog, you can try out some of the other modules and see what suits you. you might be a ground pounder or a fighter guy. or maybe a rotor head ? you can go back and fly some of the older gen planes as well. new modules are being brought out often.some tips i have are:- take notes !!! - get a stick (even a cheaper one)- get yourself a headtracker (trackir, facetrack(homemade trackir)- as much as you all love steam, i recommend getting the standalone game as you will be able to use all the avaliable mods on the forums (terrain, texture, sound, liveries) - register on the forums so you can see what new content there is from the community ( mods, screens, vids, news and projects) if you are using a single monitor i recommend playing the game in windowed mode(it is borderles so you wont see a diff) as it allows you to alt+tab a lot easier without any issues and last but not in meaning. if you ever have time, check out the mission editor tool. it is a powerful tool where you can unleash all the imaginary missions you ever had. has lurning curve as anything in this game.i've been flying the a-10c for 3 years(nearly 4) now and f-15c for year and a half and i am happy with the amount of time i've inversted in this. don't be scared that you won't be able to do something or it is too complicated. no such thing. if anyone wans help or tips for those two modules i could help out :) cheers and see you in the sky. shoutout to the 104th server, the best pvp server !p.s: if you wonder why i have so low game time. it is because i play the standalone version. i downloaded the game on steam just so i can write this review.don't be scared to ask me any questions about the a-10c and f-15c",1

16434,"fantastic game! i will find myself playing this for years to come. there are some downsides, and the u.i. is a bit confusing, but once you learn how to do everything, the game is a blast.important things to know:-to get to the gun tree, press escape a couple times-half of the reviews are made by idiots who couldn't find the gun tree, or thing that you have to pay to unlock things.-some parts in the guns are a little screwy. for example, in one revolver, you can't remove this one piece thats connected to another, but when you click the other piece, you can remove it. this is about my only complainti will probably come out with a guide explaining how to navigate the u.i., but in the mean time, good luck!",1

14671,"like many other reviewers before me, i am also dissapointed with this game. before the crate update robocraft was a game i told all my friends to play. unfortunately, the devs ruined this. constanly ignoring their community, the devs release updates that dramatically change the game. usually their changes are not for the betterment of the game, but instead, to deepen their wallets. over the 2 years i have played this game, i've seen everything that used to make this game great, get ruined by the devs implementing pay to win systems, loot boxes, and getting rid of some of the most satisfying aspects of the game. robocraft is now robosh*t",0
1838,"7.0 is the worst update ever made to a game.all versions before this were like a piece of art. the game used to be ingenious, requiring real skill and understanding of how different roles, between carry and support, accomplish victory. now, the game is a cartoony arcade. the hud is horrible. the colors of the game are too vibrant, almost cartoonish. the flow is too fast. it's essentially an arcade game for kids.i could get used to new change but when you mess the interface that much and i have to squint to see everything and i get a headache after, not gonna happen..rip dota.. thanks valve ;(",0

3823,"the premier online hat simulator, 2007 edition. if you are reading this and have never played this game, please don't start now. tf2 is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top. it has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics. it has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade. it has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)tf2 is as much a social platform as it is a video game. it's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics. there's also an fps minigame which i hear is occasionally populated. unfortunately, with the meet your match update in the summer of 2016, valve removed the quickplay function from tf2, killing off all community servers not named skial. now the landscape consists of 24/7 2fort, harvest, hightower and turbine. it's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.with mym valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers. the casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be. it's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory 60 second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game. player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason. tf2 still has huge balance issues. sniper, a poor fit for the game in 2007, is insanely un-fun to fight against 11 years later. there are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. the class needs a fundamental rework to remove the insta-kill all classes from any range mechanic. scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels. since 2016, medic runs at scout speed with any medi-gun, making scout completely dominant in 6s competitive. heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion. core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all. since 2014, heavy's minigun starts at 50% of its base damage. spy is both up and op at the same time. baguette now runs at medic speed, and faster than scout when he pops the dead ringer. valve nerfed the ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, valve overdid it by a factor of 2). they have left the diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.as of this writing, the big 3 tf2 cheats (the l word, the n word, and the c word) are all undetected. hackers are rampant in valve's competitive and casual modes, and there's plenty on the few populated community servers as well. the hasn't been a major vac ban wave in tf2 for all of 2018.all of this would be problematic but possibly understandable if valve were a small company keeping their game alive. the company is worth nearly 20 billion dollars at this point. half of that is in gaben's back pocket. there's like 5 dudes who work on tf2 (valve has claimed up to 16 at one point) and while i am sure they are working hard, they're very understaffed.valve's flat structure was a dumb idea 20 years ago, but the company did manage to produce many gems for their first decade. for the last 10 years, the company has grown hugely and made so much money they don't even know what it means to give a . the company's internal structure actively works to the detriment of the customers.if you're still reading and you've actually played this game, you know what i'm talking about. i'll see you on doublecross later this evening.",1
6182,"part i: tanksif i was asked to put it in one word, i'd say: frustrating.second word would be: dissapointing.third: hopeless.frustrating because there are so many flaws, broken mechanics, plain stupid game design decisions that you will get tons of negative emotions out of this game. lets name a few (not evey by all means, there are too many): 1. physics. they are bearable, but primitive leaving you with an impression of a very cheap or old game. tank wont pass through wire or can be stopped with a car parked on his path. we are talking about a moving tank btw.2. balance. there is none. 2 to 4 tiers of tanks in each category: lights, mediums, heavies and tds. balancer does not take tiers into account meaning you will fight t-70 in your pz ia (you can't pen their armor) or chaffies in your t-38 (they will kill you in 3 seconds. not a pleasant experience, and it will take you few months to grind to panther or t34-85. and keep in mind that intermediate tiers are not worth buying, so if you are a fan of grinding and suffering this game is for you and that review is not.3. stupid game design decisions. reto managed to create a situation where tanks are both frustrating to play for and against. as an infantry its not fun to be killed over and over again by hes with 20 m splash from another half of the map. mind that tanks have like 3 sec reload (some) so these splashes will hit often. on the other hand it takes just 2 magnetic grenades to kill a tank and there is no way to see them coming as tanks have limited vision. so you have to rely on your teammates. random teammates. good luck with that. or you can bring friend who will waist his time guarding your tank. you know what will be a reaction of a kings tiger driver when he hears an infantry whistle somewhere near? run, run for your life! like a terrified dear through the woods. yeah! thats what these so called developers (a community laughing stock) managed to create.dissapointing as the concept is good. but devs are not. they are lazy, greedy and unproffesional. so, a wasted opportunity. hopeless for the same reasons.",0

5690,i have played this game quite a bit. this game is very detailed in ariel combat. this is a learning simulator so if you have the patience to take time to learn the plane that you would like to learn than this game is for you. the detail in the planes is so amazing! the one plane that i instantly fell inlove with was the a-10 worthog. i really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. you also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!anyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.,1
4427,"if you thoroughly enjoy mobile games, dont read this review tl;dr: this game is either a mobile port, or designed to be like one. enough said. i go into nitpicky, opinionated details further in the review. this game is not what i expected. unfortunately, this game is much worse than i expected. i saw this on the new releases section of the store homepage and instantly thought, you know, the last time i played yu-gi-oh was in 6th grade. i'd like to try it again. oh boy. this was a slap in the face to me, a teenager wanting to tap into my nostalgia of this card game that i loved when i was 11/12. the first thing i noticed was that the game, which is rendered in a 720p window, had two sidebars blocked off with the yu-gi-oh! duel link logo printed on it. the only part of the screen you actually do things in is the center portion that has the dimensions of a phone in portrait mode. for me, it is beyond difficult to get through the tutorial battle because i can barely navigate through such a joke of a gui. it was then that i realized, this game was either a mobile port, or, for some stupid reason, designed to be played like a mobile game. no. just no. you don't put a mobile game of a beloved franchise and put it on steam. if you want to put a yu-gi-oh! game on steam, just make one intended for pc, mac, and linux that has no trace of mobile concepts (like that gems bs or the actual functioning resolution being limited to a phone screen). also, the recommended specs of this game are complete bs, an i5 and gtx 970 for this? honestly, if you have a gtx 970, this is not the game to use its horsepower on. i strongly recommend that if you have any sort of dislike for mobile games or a desire to play a good yu-gi-oh game on a desktop platform, try to suffer through the lack of content on steam and look for something else online. also, the main starting screen in the park area looks similar to the one from the bakugan ds game, if anybody here ever played that.",0
5986,"note: if you're not a flight simmer can you gtfo?dcs is a great game. but incredibly expensive (not the game itself, stupid). i have only two planes (f-15, f-5) and i wish i had more. hit me up if you wanna buy me the planes i want (f-18, mig 21, m2000). the plane details are ing amazing and flying them feels so good. if you get a plane that's not apart of flaming cliffs prepare your self for 250+ page manuals on how to get your plane in the air. i recommend the f-15 as the first plane you get, why is this? i recommend it because it only takes a few buttons to start up and you don't need to trim all the time once you take off. you can have a 5 course meal and not have to worry about the f-15 rolling to the right or left unintentionally.unlike most people, i use a yoke + throttle quadrant and others use a joy stick. flying with a yoke is easy imo, but it takes adjusting to figure out the perfect sensitivity. i highly recommend a yoke because it's cheaper and easier to use.the only thing i hate about this game are expensive prices for planes (it's worht it though) and no one in multiplayer. multiplayer is absolutely deserted, and no i'm not doing missions! using statistics, usually 150-350 people play dcs world according to last month. so, if you're looking for highly dense multiplayer this is not for you.do not listen to bad reviews. they're mostly people who just cry about how the game is laggy because they have a pc.oh, sorry if i didn't tell you! you need a really good pc.specs (55+ fps, default map, max graphics):gtx 108016 gb ram250 gb ssd (dcs stored on there)i5-6500before you buy get standalone game please because planes come out quicker!",1
10527,"thehunter - this review is designed to eliminate the stress of playing without knowledge of the game from first hand encounters.lets get this out of the way first.q: what is thehunter?a: thehunter is not just a game its a hunting simulation. yes a simulation.w: if you want to run around and shoot whatever moves, this is not the game for you. if your looking for freebies and handouts, this is not the game for you. if you want free stuff then you need to earn it. if you are a kid, and momma wont buy you anything, then this is not the game for you. if your stingy and dont want to spend a few bucks go back to wow and waste ur life. lastly, playing the game is free, and you can play as much as you like. if you want to play more than what you start with, then get a bundle package. (more details below)q: does it cost anything to play?a: no!h: however, the developers have made the game available to you for free. this is not a free trial. it is the complete game. you can hunt 2 species right from the start as long as you want forever. their business model is genius, if you like what you see and want more you can pay them for it.q: what does it cost if i want more?a: well it depends. the bundle deals are probably a steal on our part, their pricing is ultra low. avgs 3-4 dollars per month for unlimited access to the game(kill anything). memberships are based on 3-6-12 month packages. their bundles are the same however the perks to a bundle are priceless when compared to manually purchasing them in the shop.o: okay now, the important things to discuss. if you read any negative reviews (several) your more than likely to find its a ripoff its not free devs suck. well truth be told, your all a bunch of idiots. this isnt just a game, it is a simulation. simulation as close to reality as you can get being virtual. the game aspects are what create more playable attractions. ex: competitions, tracking, spotting levels. leaderboards, animal scoring system. personal achievments. etc.if you want to know what the game is like then i will give you the best review i possibly can honestly and in detail. honestly speaking im very dissapointed in the reviews that dont justify their responses. it royally pisses me off.my reviewhunting in its natural form requires patience, and understanding the behavioral patterns of your prey and overall, the ability to learn from your mistakes.from the start (guest non-member)as a guest or non-member you can create single player games and hunt loggers point reserve. here you will find mule deer, whitetail, rabbit, ferral hog, pheasant. guests are authorized to hunt rabbit and mule deer by default. you can continuously hunt them to your hearts content. (one blunder the devs did was make default rifle non compliant with rabbit hunting, whether this was intended or not should be fixed, its a turn off and negative review maker)when you create your game prior to starting you can choose where you want to start on the map, after doing so the game loads etc.1. right from the start its very important to realize that the game feels slow and characters are slow. no this is a hunting game, not call of freakin duty. slow and quiet is the game, and probly the most widely contributed negative review aspect. there is no animals to shoot, i run around for hours and cant find anything what a waste if you have seen a review like this then read the following.2. the ai in the game are astonishing, they simulate an emense amount of realism in the animals. slow and quiet when you stand up and walk around your a beacon to the world of animals. so crouch and move slow. the animals get spooked by 3 factores. movement, sound, and smell. by default your character is ugly, smells, and loud as ...3. the game takes time to understand, you need to put in the time to learn terrain the animals, and their patterns. when you start a new game and you go back to the spot you killed that monster buck, chances are they wont be there anymore. the ai is smart, the animals in the game actually avoid overly hunted areas. pathfinding actually changes for the animals. if the devs did this on purpose, then kudos, if not your some lucky mofo's. 4. i had to put in some long hours to actually figure how to find the animals. it sucked, and i hated it i was one of those rage quitters. then a friend of mine took me on an actual hunt. as a guest you can join multiplayer games and hunt every map/reservere. just be mindful of the liscenses you carry. anyway, what i learned in that single hour of hunting with my friend, forever changed my opinion of this game.5. when you play for the first time, expect to get frustrated if you dont actually have real life hunting habits. you will be inclined to run everywhere dont! you will spook animals and never see them. try to find a game with a host that has a high hunter score. ask them to show you, or take you on a hunt. once you learn the tricks, the game becomes exciting and fun.6. this is very important. you have been hunting mule deer for hours, now your bored. you want to kill something else. but you dont want to pay for a subscription...you can earn em$ (cash currency) by doing surveys and tasks etc from thehunter website. with em$ you can buy other liscenses in the form of 1-7-28 days. guess what now you dont have to spend your money. you can also purchase gear, weapons, etc.this game is intimidating, i usually open my games to guests and help them out. i fully understand why people do negative reviews.guys/girls this game is amazing in the aspect of what it was meant for. if you have patiencea little bit of time to spendand willing to spend a few bucksyou will not be dissapointed.i recommend this to any hunter enthusiast.",1

7887,"hearing stories of dungeons & dragons seemed epic and i loved the concept. i've never played the card game with anyone, and when i stumbled upon this game, i was quiet amazed.i have experienced many mmo's, from wow to a million of other titles - but i've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to wow. all of them were reflections of what wow became and it seemed pointless playing other mmo's. this is a whole other story.the character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and bond with your fighter as weird as that sounds. with these sort of games it's hard to see the things that make you stay from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that i put into the game is because of the combat system. you don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. it's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. you might have a friend that is a priest, like you, but he might be a engaging in battle priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. the opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. that is the main reason i stayed and i'm not vouching for anybody else. the game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then neverwinter should be your choice. there is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. the monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you should find challenging. they range from demented souls to... dragons.but yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. if you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice i can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.by no means am i an expert in this game, but i hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game.",1

13066,"fallout shelter is a f2p game that originally surfaced on mobile devices a few years ago shortly before the release of fallout 4. i remember completely failing at the task at hand and had my vault and its dwellers silenced forever due to a series of unfortunate events. i can only remember deathclaws and my poorly equipped bunch valiantly defending their incompetent overseer. recently the game was released on steam and i thought it best to try and redeem this overseer's tarnished record. the good news is that vault 757 is flourishing nicely and has a lovely bunch of dwellers who either wander around taskless or work 24/7 365 days of the year doing what they know best... constantly turning a valve. i have to say that having had a fresh approach to the game, it is really accessible and it is refreshing not to have microfractions constantly pinging up asking you to spend more and more until your savings are non-existent. you can have it running in the background while you do some work or browse the latest news. yes, tasks can be repetitive and you do have to wait to reach quests(which is the interesting part). however i'm sure you have more important things to do rather than mindlessly click on tabs... if you get tired, you can buy a few mr handys to automatically collect resources. just be careful not to have them engage with raids or infestations as these lovely machines cost 2000 caps each to repair. it's a neat little management game and i would recommend you give it a go. just remember to keep those stimpaks and radaways stocked and you'll do just fine!",1

10511,"awesome game if you like the idea of a hunting simulator all about tracking and ambushing, and you are willing to put a little time or money in.by default, you can only hunt mule deer, in one reserve, with one gun, with one type of ammo. contrary to many reviews, the .243 is a decent weapon for taking down deer (if you actually hit the vitals like you are supposed to), and the 4x scope is typically enough to make medium range shots.however, the contention in most reviews is about monetization, and i do not blame them. calling it pay to win, however, is ridiculous; there is no winning, its a simulator. all guns are locked behind a store by default, which can be purchased with a currency you buy with real money. there is one shotgun you can get with the free mission-earned currency, but earning this weapon (and the ammo for it) can be a chore, as it requires doing all of the mule deer mission line, and a bit of excess.there is an alternative to purchasing the game currency (em$) in the earn em$ feature, which can not be accessed through the steam client version. simply log in to www.thehunter.com to access this. this will allow you to complete certain offers in exchange for em$, including filling out surveys. as long as you keep an extremely critical eye on the offers you take, you can earn all the em$ you need to purchase new gear and licenses through this service, however doing so is particularly time consuming and tedious.if you find that you are having a blast hunting mule deer, and are willing to purchase a subscription and/or em$, you can look forward to quite a fun time taking down all sorts of creatures. take it for what it is and you may enjoy it: a serious hunting simulator with a somewhat flawed monetization system. not the best game of the ages when it comes to costs, but i haven't seen a comparable hunting game yet, so sometimes you take what you can get.",1

6610,"i've put many months into this game both here on steam and on the browser variant back before they had a steam option, and i won't lie. this game was (key word there *was* ) pretty decent. i enjoyed the strengths each faction posessed, how each fight was based upon the steadfast response of the generals and how quickly the soldiers (players) could react to a confrontation especially in a 3-front war zone. battles would last many hours, and you'd make a ton of money in the war mode. tanks were difficult to deal with due to the very few ways you could actually take care of it, planes could change the outcome of a war with a well-placed/timed bomb, snipers consistently moved after kills and kept enemy troops on high alert. and the two-front spawn protection (spawning on the point or if it was being taken you spawn around the outer edges, all of which with an invisibility protection until your first shot/20 feet movement.) helped keep the battles continuous and fairly balanced even in a tough situation when outnumbered or people attempting to spawn trap instead of capping the point...but then came the plague that is reto as they do with every patch in the name of fun. originally all three factions were to get their own anti tank rifles, this was a highlight for me! i love the idea of having a fair shot as a soldier to fight armor if you're smart about where you put your shots... well.. that was 2 years ago or just about at this point. the only faction of those 3 to get an at rifle is the russians with ptrd's. things then began to steadily become more... aggrivatingly skewed, from fixing lmg's to have severe conical spread almost right out of the barrel, to their recent changes that force players to purchase generals instead of career changing to them [unless that's just a bug but i'm not entirely sure of that]... the long version the war [generals] tab gives the losing factions an underdog bonsus... or well, it's supposed to. in the past few months the bonus has become forever hooked to the u.s.s.r. [this most recent being a 67% bonus to their faction even when they were in first place for the last several days.]sure, perhaps it's just a glitch in the scripting i'll accept that. it's just a buffer afterall, don't get much out of war except better income for your efforts... but then come the more notable skews.the most notorious being the yak-9's. unload multiple clips of an aa gun or p38 / bf 109 into it, it remains alive. yet get shot by it as a p-38 or bf-109, and you're chopped down in seconds, and its bombs reach several meters further than either of the other two planes (by almost 30 feet).the second being the simple fact that the russian playerbase are rather arrogant and extensively hate-based against anyone who doesn't use the russian faction, and will enter others' factions just to hate on them. this ends up causing a domino effect which gets the butt-hurt individuals in the other factions to start going around doing the same, which ends up being a giant rage-fest instead of gaming.third one being the skew in at methods... while this has recently been fixed (i use the term loosely) by giving the u.s sticky-grenades and (much later) the lawn-dart grenades for the germans, the u.s.s.r have rpg grenades, once again having had them far longer than any other faction and giving them extensive bonuses due to the fact that they can break through near triple the amount of armor compared to the others. (3 stickies to kill a light tank, 2 rpg-43's to kill a medium... 4 lawn darts to kill a light. lawn darts being far more expensive than the other two.)paratroopers primarily based on the u.s get a carbine, which wouldn't be extensively agitating if it wasn't for the fact it can get so ridiculously powerful and accurate at range that it puts the k98, mosin and m1903 to shame. [and fyi, reto... bowl shaped parachutes were not controllable in ww2. having someone able to avoid quad-50 cal aa gun fire just by spazzing a and d rapidly is stupidly aggrivating, especially when 6 paratroopers are dropping on one point and can land on the *same roof* when dropping from almost 600+ meters seperation on dropping from the plane.]then comes the most recent rage. the pontoon-vehicle introduction. getting those vehicles was awesome. don't get me wrong. but to suddenly have russia with the *only* water-capable tank, and the *only* water-capable jeep that can use an mg mount on it, is far from showing a desire for fun in the game as you so callously flaunt at our faces. germans and u.s forces were known to use snorkels on their tanks for a reason.the most disgusting thing they've done though, is the spawn change. now you end up being spawn trapped by paratroopers and tanks more than you do getting shot by actual combatants. not only this, but if you lose the point while you're fighting *they take your gun away* because you're suddenly in an enemy spawn zone! this leaves you completely incapable of guarding yourself while you try to get away! giving them a free kill! on top of this, due to the spawns being pre-determined in 2-3 locations *per mark* you will not be able to avoid spawn killers. the moment you're spotted, you're screwed. also, when you end up being at your last point, you end up getting spawned several hundred yards away! so if you're the only one left defending (which happens alot) you end up running over there just to realize you're too late.in recent updates their camera has been freaking out extensively, primarily when prone on a hill or small incline/descent. this leads to your character looking like it's jerking off extensively, especially when you're trying to aim, which ends with death to you due to being unable to even fire unless you stand or crouch.tldr for those who can't read a player's rant aka the short version...: 1) underdog bonus is bugged to the russian's benefit and has been for several months... could just be a bug, doubt it though.2) russian players are irritating rats who don't like to lose and will enter others' factions just to rage at them in the war chats [which leads to flame wars in the chats in various languages on all 3 factions and in support chat]3) at weaponry is extensively out-performed where it actually counts. russians seem to be in the lead as far as damage capability.)4) paratroopers, especially u.s, are extensively abused to spawn kill using their m2 carbines since they only use 5 equip slots.5) water-capable vehicles are awesome! russia having the only water-capable tank and jeep able to carry a gun? not so much6) spawn change sucks balls, and has destroyed the ability of defending troops to actually do much on the matter.7) laying/going prone on a hill is a bad idea. your camera spazzes out, and they refuse to listen when you send in a ticket about these issues. even when given video evidence of it happening on anything less than flat ground. (recent patch has fixed this issue.)final outcomegame: 5/5developers: -2/5you want a game to pass the time, this'll work. everything is acquirable free of charge, even premium time! it's just a very long grind. but be warned you will rage at some point for one reason or another. don't play war without a squad of at least 3 people. and don't expect a team to work as a team.their help desk, ticket support and reporting system are crap as well. don't expect help when you need it, and don't expect much to happen when someone starts flipping off in the support channel/faction chats/global chats and so forth. at least they fixed the player search function next to the chat to actually see all the players in the chat, albeit it resets your search when someone new enters, which makes it just as worthless as it was. so don't expect to be able to block/ignore them unless you see them in-game.update 11/27/2017: no differences. still broken bias.",0

11226,"i quite enjoy this game, since i wanted to scratch my mtg-itch. it does a lot of stuff right: the game speed is nice, gui is enhancing the experience and there's a sense of progression as you grind your way up.what i don't like is unfortunately a core mechanic of the standard game: dead draws! how can they still be in a new card game?!it feels so punishing drawing resource cards when you want some kind of answer for the board. on top of that the deck size is 75 cards with a maximum of 4 copies per card and you're forced to make 1/3 of the deck resource cards!this game wants you to use a more watered down deck than mtg, increase the rng and restrict your deck building even more. i really feel this is a core problem with the game, so much so that i wouldn't recommend it.from what i've seen this is also the nail in the coffin for other players.in my mind the fix for this problem would be: allow hero/avatar powers. the 5 campaign heroes each already have their own 2 mana spell, which has a little effect (gain 2 armor, ...) and draws you a resource card. why not make it a permanent ability?also remove the 1/3 of deck forced resource, so people have more freedom to build.i think i'll spend a little more time with this game, but once i'm bored i won't revisit it again unless there's a core change that tackles the dead draw problem. i only wish this promising game would stop sticking with frustrating mechanics of the past or else it will die rather quickly.",0

6699,"so with 1000+ hours of gameplay i belive my review can be considered relevant.i started playing this game almost a year ago and was really into it. i know it is still in beta so there would be updates and stuff.so as the time went they added new stuff, which was cool. but then the updates werent really updates...but downgrades. with every single one, the game got worse and worse. constantly messing up with the stats of vehicles and weapons just got ridiculous. even though the developers claimed they wanted to have each faction different sort of gear, good and bad, they started to mess things up so in the end it doesnt really matter what side you are playing, its the same.the worst thing is that this game became pay to win. so if you are not willing to sink hundreds of dollars into a computer game, dont install it. after the last update the prices went triple and possibility to earn credits in game was reduced by half. another funny thing is that the developers claim there is 5 million players well there is at max 10 thousand online every time, so i guess the total amount of active players cant be higher than 100k..which is 1/50 of what they claimto conclude it, it gets worse and worse with every update. i will give it two weeks, then i quit as well.",0

10769,"pros:+ the few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ similar to magic the gatheringcons:- most games go into top deck mode- mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- legendaries are very expensive- stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed: think this is very misguided. ccgs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. take league of legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. as far as i am concerned, every match where i'm mana screwed is the same. i have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.since the playerbase is comprised of mostly magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.another praise i often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why i became interested in the first place. again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.verdict:overall, eternal is a near exact copy of magic. to me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. however, i cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from magic.",0

13196,"i'm not an expert on this type of game, but can say that tiny tower (nimblebit) circa 2014 was way less infuriating and way more engaging.i've played both on mobile and on pc. the game is much more suited for mobile, but it was too difficult on a small screen. attackers at the door, then a stray touch (easy to do on bezel-less and curved screen phones) would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen...zoom back out, try to grab a 3mm tall guy on the screen, but can't do that until the resources are collected...collect the resources, misclick trying to tap-hold the guy 3 more times, zoom back in, grab him, slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom, have the screen not register your finger for a moment while dragging him, scroll back down to that room, grab him again, and finally...stick him in the front room. now check his weapon, try sorting the weapon list, but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapons to find your one rare/legendary that you stuck on someone after a failed rush...now you have 1 defender! of course, the fight's halfway over now, people are dead.now, watch slow, mostly passive combat with quirky, seemingly redundant controls. are we having fun yet? terrible experience, boring as hell. and now you've wasted 8 hours of travel time because you wanted to save a few medpacks for incident emergencies.later, once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity, even if you don't have a radio station, watch deathclaws rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunting rifle equivalents. rage quit. come back a bit later, get hit with deathclaws again before you've even been able to heal up from the first attack. live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack--or even the next scorpion attack, now that you're out of medpacks and rushing them is too risky--the next attack could wipe out your entire vault. extremely mismatched risk for a game that's mostly planning and hands-off waiting. the best way to avoid losing your vault is to keep the game closed as much as possible. lol?next day, your phone screen turns on once in the middle of the night...wake up to a pile of bodies and no way to roll back to the last save. give up on that vault. there's so much waiting that you'll probably have the same result after falling asleep during all the excitement.tried switching to pc to deal with pain of moving defenders around to incidents, but it was almost as much a pita as on android. also, the tap zooming is ridiculous. i just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom. --positives: - appropriately priced base game.- the humor is legitimately great, especially for fallout fans.- cloud save doesn't work between steam and android, but you can manually transfer unaltered savefiles between the two platforms. - you can also back up these files, but it's kind of a pain.- possible to edit your saves if you can resist doing things that will ruin progression.- critical hit meter is cool.- epically soporific excitement. waiting 7 minutes for your medpacks to finish, 3 hours for your baby dweller, 3 more for them to grow up, 7 hours for your special point training, 6 hours for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach, 8 hours for your scavenger to return, and 4 days for your weapon, all intermixed with deathclaw panic.--negatives:freemium or not, i expect a lot more from a major studio in terms of design. the basic interface interactions have none of the refinement/friendliness of your average knock-off clash game, and there's a lot to be desired in terms of quality of life. also, deathclaws are ridiculously unbalanced at early levels.started on android, but loads of problems. constant crashing. had to reload game twice each time after it had been fully shut down. quests would take like 10+ seconds of loading screen, usually followed by a crash. this is on probably the most popular flagship phone running oreo. (coudn't get it past the savefile screen on memu either.) hey bethesda, maybe hire some mobile devs...on day 1, my phone actually warned me the app had crashed 10 times and that it was slowing down my phone. --if you could turn deathclaws off in normal mode or if the controls didn't so often get in the way of reacting quickly (eg preset loadouts, or pausing game while using equipment/garrison interfaces) i'd be way more excited about this game. -- edit: oh yeah, and the rush %sages are absolute garbage. 40%=90%. this mechanic isn't clever or challenging, it's just dumb. given their obnoxious interface, the number should 1. accurately reflect the base rate, obviously, and 2. visibly change based on the luck modifiers present so you don't have to tediously check every dweller's setup.whoever designed this mechanic should see if mcd's is hiring.",0

2501,"hello friend, as a player who has put over 4600 hours into this game over the course of more than five years, and being among the most qualified players on the whole of the steam platform to review this game, i can unequivocally tell you, do not involve yourself in war thunder. do not pay money into this game. what follows, in no particular order, is a list of grievances: the development of this game has been like a car crash in slow motion. wt includes pay to win elements, gambling mechanics aimed at children, russian nationalism, loot boxes, and one of the most degenerate and coercive free to play economies that has ever been implemented in a video game. the game is fundamentally flawed in terms of vehicle balance and matchmaking is a disaster. queue times for end game content go on for upwards of 50 minutes for matches that are essentially vacant; six player teams. datamining has revealed evidence that russian vehicles in the game were equipped with hidden modifiers that increased their survivability. the grind is hollow and unrewarding even when you pay for a premium membership/ vehicle. the wt community is toxic in a way that makes cod and lol look like dolphin swim adventure. these people hate each other and everything around them. behaviors include racisim, misogyny, homophobia, etc., with rampant teamkilling, mission sabotage, and hate messaging. gaijin's community management/ public relations is a dumpster fire and everyone i know dislikes them personally. the moderators of the war thunder forums employ a draconian form of censorship that silences and disappears crticism of the game, while punishing the forums authors with user bans. bugs and historical inaccuracies in the game remain present over the course of years, and are ignored by the developers even when historical documents are provided for them. the developers are drowning the game in new currencies and markets. events in wt now revolve around a counterfeit marketplace where the event itself is no longer designed to be fun or entertaining, but with the goal of pressuring the player to pay into the marketplace in order to unlock game content. wt employs a round robin system of rebalancing which artificially and ahistorically changes the behavior of vehicle ammunition, armor, etc. in order to influence the style of play. the developers use this technique in order to force players to grind through game content, rather than simply allowing them to play where they feel most comfortable. this is not an exhaustive list.all my love and affection,- kwkp.s. free parts and fpe!",0

1098,so far i am still new to the game and trying to find my footing but i really enjoy the experience. the graphics are superb and the game seems to be very playable. i am finding that it is taking awhile to adjust to using the keyboard as a controller. i am sure that as the game is further developed there will be a dedicated controlled available for us pc users. the developers are doing an excellent job and the game is amazingly mature for an alpha release. i have already recommended it to others and will continue to do so. i look forward to having more throttle time on the game!,1

3584,access reviewthis game is like if fortnite and ghost recon had a four-way with final fantasy and ssx. the gunplay is ridicuously solid for a free game and the spawn system and 3 equipment loadouts are a fun twist on an overbranded genre. abso-freaking-lutely recommend this game.,1
6402,"i would first like to say that i am not recommending this game at it's current state.this game really deserves a good review. in fact, it could've been one of the best ww2 games. i really, really want to recommend this because i myself am a fan of fps, large-scale battles and ww2 and i was surprised seeing the variety of ww2 weapons and the skirmishes actually feel realistic and the feeling of needing to go prone in a field of heavy gun fire is amazing. unfortunately, however, to get all the good stuff you're gonna have to grind... a lot. the game has a progression system so very slow that it is almost excruciatingly painful and after all the grind for experience. the weapon you worked so hard for is overpriced (92k for a slightly more accurate and lower rof version of the starting weapon). and a thing to note is reaching tier 2. maybe you dominated everything in the first ranks with your modded grease gun or your accurate sniping with the karabiner 98 and maybe you've gotten a lot of driving experience from your trusty gaz and then you reach tier 2... holy before you know it you'll get killed by a guy with an mg42 or get spawncampeed by a plane. the thing is that, this game has so much potential but a very problematic execution. don't take this review saying this game sucks! cause it is in fact good and i would support reto into making this game better.i just want people to wait until this game is completely finished cause only then they will realize how great it is.edit its ing hopeless. go buy red orchestra 2/rising storm instead.",0

3537,"i honestly never type reviews or some sorts. but i had too tbh.when i first started playing this game i was just thinking its just a pubg look alike br.and yes, there is alot of game mechanics which makes this game look like pubg. but we cant forget there is alot of stuff you can do that pubg dosent even have.you can litterly snowboard to go fast thru a field, down a mountain which you need to evacuate from asap. or glide youroff to safety, or rush people with those . you can even climb mountains, you can you a grappler to get from mountains and towns.you have varierty of wepeons which you gonna realize you like more the more you play. you play with wepeons that suits your playstyle. ive only played this game for 40 hours now and i have to tell that its really amazed me, i wasnt expecting to keep playing and just quit after a few games. but i have to say its really enjoyable. ive played pubg, but it kinda sucks you only can only drive 3 different cars, and run for the most of the time. on roe we have 5+ different vehicles. we can transport easy without a car. its alot more fast paced. and its awesome to shoot people that are gliding in the air or snowboarding away for example.watching people take the elevator thingys and shoot the whole thing down. amazing experience. this game is fun to play alone, but 1000% more enjoyable to play with friends...ofc this games feels cluncky here and there. but its alpha after all.game has big potential. worth a try.if you wanna look at my first video/montage ive made this game, it would be very helpful to drop a like and maybe a sub for future videos :)",1

13573,"tl/dr time to set some innacurate information straight. for actual review about the game features, see the archive of my other reviews in the link at the end.i've seen a few negative reviews that, in my opinion, share inacurate information. as such, this review will serve as a rectification.pay to win, pay to speed up and yes, even pay for orethese are all untrue: ore cannot be purchased, it's extracted for free in the game world using extractors (3 varieties with increased yield and speed). there has also been some positive adjustment to increase iron yield and ease of mining since it was argued to be the rarest or hardest to find.unlike mobile games, there is no option to speed up cooldowns and such by paying money. instead, you are encouraged to get better gear by progressing through the crafting system that's more efficient (mining cell, extractors). as for the processor/forges, there is no limit to the number you can have working concurently and you can now feed them 5 items in a single shift+click (so instead of filling one with 20 clicks, why not shift+click 4 that will be done 4x faster!).pay to win applies traditionaly to games that are competitive by nature and where you can buy an edge that free player could not compete with. even assuming this loosely apply to this type of game : flash light can be replaced with free light sources (that even prevent monster spawning, where the flash light does not) ; increased stamina can be gotten through food and is purely optional to build ; glider allow to reach high places... but so does jumping and placing blocks below yourself.need to pay to create a worldthat is simply innacurate : every free players get one world, no matter how much it really cost to maintain them hosted on servers. free players can also play on any public world (not protect by password or realeased as public world) owned by other. if you've made a huge mistake and want to start anew, there is a function that allows you to reset your world.microtransactions paywallthe available content for free : all published adventures, all blueprints (on the off chance they use blocks you don't have yet, these can be substituted for others), all machines, all tools, all the natural blocks and ore you can find in the world, all armors, all weapon except one (and it's not the best one), all the creatures and their loot (that can be tamed as pet), all the available food recipes, all potions, the major part of all crafted blocks (including blocks, slopes/roof, stairs, doors, ladders, fences, furniture, light source and chests).the content available for purchace : a few sets of blocks that are purely optional and that a lot of players will allow you to try for free.all in all, i'd be surprised if someone made a formal analysis of quantitative free vs paid content... pretty sure it'd be below 10% (and probably by far).minecraft clonei simply don't understand that one. there are lots of game out there that share similarities to other game (most war games, most fps games, etc)... a lot of other people have made great argument about this subject : check the forums (incliding minecraft being itself a clone of infiniminer or some such).nb : an archive of my reviews can be found in this guide. some of you may get the joke on the title.",1

2119,"tl;dr at the bottom.how should i start this off..well, this game is a free mmo hack n' slash type game, with a large skill tree and many builds/characters you can make to destroy your opponents with. when it says free, it truly means free. the only thing not free, or micro-transaction, is the trails & certain masks as well as storage. so, in my opinion that really means it's free. because, you aren't forced to buy anything to do certain quests, or to proceed in the game. it's a well rounded hack n' slash game with very unique & clean combat. the skill tree is complex, and a build guide is highly recommended for all new players. it may seem a little... extreme the first time you open the skill tree, when i first saw it i wanted to run away and hide under a rock, but it's really nothing to be scared of. you will be met with people in the chat talking about 6l's and unique weapons, and weapons with certain stats etc. the only real learning curve to this game is asking people what it means, or using the poe wiki, which for new players i would say is extremely helpful. get this though, i don't know everything about this game.. at all, i am still learning a ton of the mechanics and the functions of certain things.pros +free to play.+complex & intriguing passive skill tree.+all around great game.+extremely addicting and worth the download.+actually free to play. don't have to spend money to pass quests.+no membership.cons-a small learning curve than will generally take about 8 - 9 hours to learn the more intermediate stuff. some great guides on the internet about it!tl;dr version:great game, amazing skill tree, actually free to play! so what are you doing here?! go play it!",1

14922,"don't play this new epic loot update. it's a trap for monetary reasons. you'll earn nothing and just spend hours in matches to earn blocks. you can't even reasonably get the items you want to build your own bots anymore. even if you pay, there's a high likelyhood you'll earn nothing for that money. it's a skinner box and the devs won't listen to change that. just look on their forums and see the outcry. they only want to deepen their pockets, they care far less for their players.",0

16544,"disclaimer: the game itself is not inherently bad. i did put over 15 hours into it before uninstalling it. you've got the mechanics of bloons td 5 coupled with a competitive multiplayer aspect. however, there are many flaws within the game's mechanics that simply make it such that i would not tell my friends about it.first, the game is straight up pay2win. bloons td5 is good, this is a cash grab. the game would be better balanced if they just charged five bucks for it and put everyone on equal footing, but that's not the case. you buy tower unlocks, which give you an advantage over your opponent. you buy energy, which gives you an advantage over your opponent. you buy club access (unobtainable by non-paying), which gives you access to more arenas with special rules.second, there's some balance issues. did you spend $10 on the newbie starter pack? if you did, you have enough medallions to buy the cobra tower. this tower makes it impossible to lose versus players that don't have this tower. in defense mode, you gain extra lives every fifteen seconds, which is sizable. in assault mode, your opponent loses 2 of their 150 lives every fifteen seconds, per cobra tower you have. that is to say, you will win versus your opponents without having to watch a single bloon go by them. buy these towers and upgrade them, then wait 'em out. in both assault and defense modes (both of the f2p modes), this tower also increases your cash income by giving you extra money every round.--if you have it, where's the fun in stomping people that don't have it?--if you don't have it, where's the fun in losing a game where the rules don't matter?third, the meta is very stale. at the higher ranks, everyone uses the same tower loadout. just google bloons td battles chipper farm.-did you not spend $10 on this, because the game is supposedly free? many of your matches will be fair, but if you see a cobra tower on the other side, just surrender, because you're losing this round. not to the rules of the game, but rather, to teh ultimate tower!!11!!one!!!-your energy replenishes at a rate of 5 per hour, to a max of 20. is that too slow? buy more energy with real monies! is the energy cap too low? buy an increase! energy has a tangible effect on the game, most notably, by increasing the attack speed of all your towers for a short time (a la the mib call to arms effect in bloons td 5). are you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game? your opponents may simply have an advantage over you, as they can use this ability and you cannot.-instead of using towers to unlock higher tiers, you use medallions to unlock higher tiers as your level increases. don't feel like using medallions and/or waiting for your level to get high enough? guess what! five bucks gets around all that noise!-card mode is akin to hearthstone, in that whoever has the most sunk into it wins. the details and mechanics are too esoteric to go into here, but it's even worse than the assault/defense mode balances.-to top it all off, the game is full of cheaters. just google bloons td battles hacks and click on any of the myriad results to get an example of this.tl, dr: the game would be better if the following occurred.-strict and immediate punishment for cheaters.-cobra towers removed or rebalanced. (pay money to get these!)-an equal amount of energy given to both players at the start of a match. (pay money to have more!)-tower level limits equal on both players in a match. (pay money to max towers!)",0
2800,"war thunder is probably my most favoritve game on pc, and i have invested nearly five hundreds hours into this game. it's graphics are sublime, maps are large and if you can get a squad together it's some of the most fun you and your friends can have. but there is a major problem, the grind. and the grind is terrible, making me stop playing for two months until the latest update whick piked my intrest. grinding for new parts and vehicles at the low tiers is easy and relatively fun (even though for some strange reason ,ie microtransactions, essential parts like fire supression are not stock. making tank battles impossible to come out alive) at later levels it slow's down to a crawl. making it a huge headache to keep moving up.but there is a way around this, microtransactions! making the game almost laughably easy if you're wallet is deep enough. those who don't fork over the cash either spend hours grinding a single vehicles to not die in seconds, or get stomped by everyone else. it's irritating and demoralising to see people who have invested less than twenty hours be at tier four with everything fully upgraded. i've spent the last thirty minutes looking at my bank account debating to finally give in and fork over some cash.long story short, the game is fun at lower levels. basically anything past tier two becomes a grind unless you fork over cash.",0
11924,i have tried to enjoy this game but i'm just full of dissapointmenti had to manually fix the graphical settings in notepad++.get stuck in splash pages for hours...clunky combat and a complete lie about the graphics engine used.. i can't i just can'tthis game will be another korean grind fest mmo that crashes and burns.they will milk the players for a year and then announce it's shutdwon like many others have,0
11575,"not at all terrible. feedback from guns / kills is a bit much (better too much than too little on that tbh). netcode isn't terrible. weapon unlocks seem a bit uphill, in the sense that based on what i was earning with 1st and 2nd place in dm it would have taken about 100 +/- matches to unlock a new gun. cash shop doesn't seem crazy, uses some minimally trashy tactics (character costs $13 in currency to make sure you invest $15 etc). matches are fun, but with how small the maps are they seem way to long. the system for inviting friends to matches is cryptic af (have to be in a lobby and use messenger to add them), but that's a fairly minor gripe.if you haven't tried it and you're interested *at all* just dl it and check it out. it's not going in my normal game rotation, but it might go in yours.",1
11177,"great game at its core. a perfect mix of hearthstone and mtg, fast paced and interesting card mechanics, deck possibilities. however after banging my head against a single deck (red/green aggro warcry) and several ragequits, i can`t recommend this game until the devs fix this meta.",0

5169,"an amazing 2d platform fighting game with or without and ssb experience its still fun. there are so many good things i want to say about this game but i really want to get back to playing it so i'll list.pros:-fun to play but easy to learn-if you're dedicated enough you can get pretty decent at the game really fast-loads of characters and playstyles-no pay to win. all characters can be unlocked through a bit of play.-a free roll of characters every week so you have the chance to play online and with others with all characters-great community (for the most part... every fighting game has salty players)-easy to navigate interface-easy to set up and join matches with friends-fun to play with or without friends :)cons:-1/50 games you play will have a server that will lag tf out!-salty players!-takes about 30 games to get a character (if you play on ffa and win most battles)all you need to know is that the game is extremely fun! as you can tell, most of the cons are superficial things, i just needed to write something for the cons. have fun and welcome to braaawwlllhaaala",1
