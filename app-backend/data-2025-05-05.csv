That was a novel approach 15 years ago in Dark Souls 1. By now the novelty has worn off. Everyone is as vague, unrelatable, and unhelpful as possible, providing absolutely no in-universe motivation or context for your actions.- Combat, exploration, and balance are at odds with each other. The combat is hard, punishing you for experimenting or being a jack of all trades. You  to optimise. This means that 99% of the items you find are useless for your build. This, in turn, renders exploration useless - you can spend hours clearing copy-pasted dungeons and not find anything useful, so why bother?- The game is basically Dark Souls but with a whole bunch of empty open areas and identical mini-dungeons to add padding between the main dungeons. Problem is, all this new content is far less interesting than the actual dungeons. It just dilutes the experience, rather than enhancing it.- Once again, summoning other players to help is extremely janky. Most new players will need a guide to figure it out. Then the game goes and makes summoning an even more central part of the experience by giving you NPC allies you can always summon for boss fights.

5W9TZX4mKlRZb6jUR7CmYo0rKwwQcELwZFxwnuQidF,elden ring,Steam,"This  is the worst game FromSoft has made yet. I wanted to wait until FromSoft's next game, and for me to complete my randomizer run to say this. Having beat this game 6 different times, across many characters, DLC included, and having done a randomizer run as well, i must say this is a very disappointing game. Disappointing for a FromSoft game at least, which means it's like an 8 out of 10 for other games. When you first play this game, you will more than likely think it is the greatest game in the world, which is fair. That feeling last a while, at least until maybe 75 percent through the game, and then you'll start to feel the bloat. Maybe sooner if you're like me. Open world games sound awesome at first. Far cry comes to mind, where it sounds like such an excellent idea, until you realize that just means an empty open world, with reused enemies, rewards that don't feel worth it, and time wasted over and over just going from A to B. This game has many pros, such as the graphics, atmosphere, gameplay, build variety, and a lot of great moments. And at times, this really does feel like the natural evolution of dark souls. But when you play enough, you'll realize how fleeting this feeling is.And those moments are fleeting when i remember the cons. The biggest one being the reuse of bosses and enemies. The online discussion around this topic is utterly devoid of intelligence, with most people arguing the definition of unique. this game has 207 bosses including DLC, and no joke you might fight the same ones about 10 separate times on some occasions. There is maybe 20 bosses that you fight once. one time. that is borderline insanity. Nobody is having fun fighting nights Calvary twenty times. no one is excited to see an excellent boss design, with tons of build up, like Astel reused for no reason whatsoever. worst part of the entire game is walking through a boss door and seeing something you have already beaten before. This sounds like a small issue, but trust me, you will notice it before you finish your first run. and any run after that, more likely than not you'll skip those reused bosses that give you useless rewards. why would you go through these small side dungeons on your second run through? there is no gain, unless it's something specific for your build. Overall i feel this one problem taints the game to such a degree that it has the most content of any FromSoft game, and is also the least replayable. The bosses also have a big con to them with their movesets here and there, but that's more specific to those bosses and i won't get into it (waterfowl dance, rahdan consort three swipe attack, etc.)Admittedly, If you play this game you'll probably like it. These big issues won't rear their head until you're multiple runs in. but that doesn't mean they're invisible, and furthermore, that's okay. no game is perfect, but people will argue up and down with you about this game because it's the most popular game in the world. but it isn't without issues. I won't list every issue here, and even though i don't like this game at all, it would be disingenuous of me to leave a thumbs down, because the average person is going to love this game. if you're reading this and you're on the fence about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy dark souls or sekiro or bloodborne first, because this is FromSoft's worst game yet.",NEGATIVE,May 4,Recommended

These big issues won't rear their head until you're multiple runs in. but that doesn't mean they're invisible, and furthermore, that's okay. no game is perfect, but people will argue up and down with you about this game because it's the most popular game in the world. but it isn't without issues. I won't list every issue here, and even though i don't like this game at all, it would be disingenuous of me to leave a thumbs down, because the average person is going to love this game. if you're reading this and you're on the fence about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy dark souls or sekiro or bloodborne first, because this is FromSoft's worst game yet.",NEGATIVE,May 4,Recommended

If you just want hours and hours of tense combat and a bunch of big bosses, Elden Ring delivers. + There's some nice vistas.The Bad:- Most everything else, unfortunately.- FromSoft continues to substitute hints of lore in place of actually having an interesting story or characters. That was a novel approach 15 years ago in Dark Souls 1. By now the novelty has worn off. Everyone is as vague, unrelatable, and unhelpful as possible, providing absolutely no in-universe motivation or context for your actions.- Combat, exploration, and balance are at odds with each other. The combat is hard, punishing you for experimenting or being a jack of all trades. You  to optimise. This means that 99% of the items you find are useless for your build. This, in turn, renders exploration useless - you can spend hours clearing copy-pasted dungeons and not find anything useful, so why bother?- The game is basically Dark Souls but with a whole bunch of empty open areas and identical mini-dungeons to add padding between the main dungeons. Problem is, all this new content is far less interesting than the actual dungeons. It just dilutes the experience, rather than enhancing it.- Once again, summoning other players to help is extremely janky. Most new players will need a guide to figure it out. Then the game goes and makes summoning an even more central part of the experience by giving you NPC allies you can always summon for boss fights. And yet, the boss AI  falls apart the moment it tries to handle multiple opponents.",NEGATIVE,May 5,Not Recommended

5W9TZX4mKlRZb6jUR7CmYo0rKwwQcELwZFxwnuQidF,elden ring,Steam,"This  is the worst game FromSoft has made yet. I wanted to wait until FromSoft's next game, and for me to complete my randomizer run to say this. Having beat this game 6 different times, across many characters, DLC included, and having done a randomizer run as well, i must say this is a very disappointing game. Disappointing for a FromSoft game at least, which means it's like an 8 out of 10 for other games. When you first play this game, you will more than likely think it is the greatest game in the world, which is fair. That feeling last a while, at least until maybe 75 percent through the game, and then you'll start to feel the bloat. Maybe sooner if you're like me. Open world games sound awesome at first. Far cry comes to mind, where it sounds like such an excellent idea, until you realize that just means an empty open world, with reused enemies, rewards that don't feel worth it, and time wasted over and over just going from A to B. This game has many pros, such as the graphics, atmosphere, gameplay, build variety, and a lot of great moments. And at times, this really does feel like the natural evolution of dark souls. But when you play enough, you'll realize how fleeting this feeling is.And those moments are fleeting when i remember the cons. The biggest one being the reuse of bosses and enemies. The online discussion around this topic is utterly devoid of intelligence, with most people arguing the definition of unique. this game has 207 bosses including DLC, and no joke you might fight the same ones about 10 separate times on some occasions. There is maybe 20 bosses that you fight once. one time. that is borderline insanity. Nobody is having fun fighting nights Calvary twenty times. no one is excited to see an excellent boss design, with tons of build up, like Astel reused for no reason whatsoever. worst part of the entire game is walking through a boss door and seeing something you have already beaten before. This sounds like a small issue, but trust me, you will notice it before you finish your first run. and any run after that, more likely than not you'll skip those reused bosses that give you useless rewards. why would you go through these small side dungeons on your second run through? there is no gain, unless it's something specific for your build. Overall i feel this one problem taints the game to such a degree that it has the most content of any FromSoft game, and is also the least replayable. The bosses also have a big con to them with their movesets here and there, but that's more specific to those bosses and i won't get into it (waterfowl dance, rahdan consort three swipe attack, etc.)Admittedly, If you play this game you'll probably like it.

t1_mkc7um0,skyrim,Reddit,"I believe the issue with the size of blackreach in-relation to the amount and depth of content available there was simply a limitation of the game engine at the time Skyrim was designed. Skyrims game engine was revolutionary upon the time of release, completely blowing out of the water by a huge margin all other competition based on the shear size and scope of content Skyrim could offer the player.

However, even the best game engine of its time still has limitations. My understanding based on watching and reading various dev blogs talking about blackreach was that the larger a single loading area and more complex its design (number of unique entities, decorations, etc) the more the loading time increases exponentially. So the devs were limited by the shear size of blackreach being treated as a single loading space, by contrast even the overworld is not loaded like blackreach is as a single space but is instead broken into various chunks which can be independently loaded in relation to the players location keeping load times reasonable and preventing them from snowballing exponentially.

It’s because of load time restrictions that many areas of blackreach feel bare or unfinished, the devs did have more plans to add more spaces, this is why for example you can see paths in blackreach that would appear from the main road to lead to separate smaller dungeon but if you follow them they eventually deadend instead. If the devs were to have proceeded adding a bunch of additional sub-areas to blackreach, whether their own separately loaded area or connected to blackreach’s area, it would have made the load times multiple minutes between screens.

The devs ultimate pulled back some of their development plans for blackreach after learning this, because they didn’t want the area and questlines there to be overshadowed by load times they knew players wouldn’t tolerate if they were significantly longer than anywhere else in the game. Blackreach was designed to be a mold breaking area, deviating from the rest of Skyrim around it, and as such it was filled with a lot of detail, mobs, and areas that the rest of Skyrim either doesn’t have at all or has in much more sparing quantities. 

It wasn’t until a few Years after release that Bethesda had nearly fully sorted out the load time issues with various major updates, but by that time there was no logic to updating blackreach with the missing content they originally desired to add. So, instead, what we ended up getting was something like we see with the isle of solestein.

t1_mkc7um0,skyrim,Reddit,"I believe the issue with the size of blackreach in-relation to the amount and depth of content available there was simply a limitation of the game engine at the time Skyrim was designed. Skyrims game engine was revolutionary upon the time of release, completely blowing out of the water by a huge margin all other competition based on the shear size and scope of content Skyrim could offer the player.

However, even the best game engine of its time still has limitations. My understanding based on watching and reading various dev blogs talking about blackreach was that the larger a single loading area and more complex its design (number of unique entities, decorations, etc) the more the loading time increases exponentially. So the devs were limited by the shear size of blackreach being treated as a single loading space, by contrast even the overworld is not loaded like blackreach is as a single space but is instead broken into various chunks which can be independently loaded in relation to the players location keeping load times reasonable and preventing them from snowballing exponentially.

It’s because of load time restrictions that many areas of blackreach feel bare or unfinished, the devs did have more plans to add more spaces, this is why for example you can see paths in blackreach that would appear from the main road to lead to separate smaller dungeon but if you follow them they eventually deadend instead. If the devs were to have proceeded adding a bunch of additional sub-areas to blackreach, whether their own separately loaded area or connected to blackreach’s area, it would have made the load times multiple minutes between screens.

The devs ultimate pulled back some of their development plans for blackreach after learning this, because they didn’t want the area and questlines there to be overshadowed by load times they knew players wouldn’t tolerate if they were significantly longer than anywhere else in the game. Blackreach was designed to be a mold breaking area, deviating from the rest of Skyrim around it, and as such it was filled with a lot of detail, mobs, and areas that the rest of Skyrim either doesn’t have at all or has in much more sparing quantities. 

It wasn’t until a few Years after release that Bethesda had nearly fully sorted out the load time issues with various major updates, but by that time there was no logic to updating blackreach with the missing content they originally desired to add. So, instead, what we ended up getting was something like we see with the isle of solestein.

My understanding based on watching and reading various dev blogs talking about blackreach was that the larger a single loading area and more complex its design (number of unique entities, decorations, etc) the more the loading time increases exponentially. So the devs were limited by the shear size of blackreach being treated as a single loading space, by contrast even the overworld is not loaded like blackreach is as a single space but is instead broken into various chunks which can be independently loaded in relation to the players location keeping load times reasonable and preventing them from snowballing exponentially.

It’s because of load time restrictions that many areas of blackreach feel bare or unfinished, the devs did have more plans to add more spaces, this is why for example you can see paths in blackreach that would appear from the main road to lead to separate smaller dungeon but if you follow them they eventually deadend instead. If the devs were to have proceeded adding a bunch of additional sub-areas to blackreach, whether their own separately loaded area or connected to blackreach’s area, it would have made the load times multiple minutes between screens.

The devs ultimate pulled back some of their development plans for blackreach after learning this, because they didn’t want the area and questlines there to be overshadowed by load times they knew players wouldn’t tolerate if they were significantly longer than anywhere else in the game. Blackreach was designed to be a mold breaking area, deviating from the rest of Skyrim around it, and as such it was filled with a lot of detail, mobs, and areas that the rest of Skyrim either doesn’t have at all or has in much more sparing quantities. 

It wasn’t until a few Years after release that Bethesda had nearly fully sorted out the load time issues with various major updates, but by that time there was no logic to updating blackreach with the missing content they originally desired to add. So, instead, what we ended up getting was something like we see with the isle of solestein. Solestein is a great example of what the devs wish they could have done with blackreach originally, a completely new terrain different from the rest of Skyrim with detailed and extensive unique mods, encounters, decorations, weapons, and areas, but all without having the loads times balloon to 3x the normal. Anyway, just my 2 cents.",NEGATIVE,2025-03-29 11:14:41,

How in the fuck are they going to make dragons *more prominent* than in Skyrim?",NEGATIVE,2025-02-21 22:24:02,
