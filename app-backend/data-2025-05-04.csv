All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect...

...Hmph. ¬†No matter. ¬†Heed my words.

If you've any sense, you'll go find another sub to huddle up inside.

You here, in this land of Hollows, you're like a frail maiden on the front lines.

If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion‚Ä¶

You'll face death, and it won't be pretty...

t1_fo69j1y,eldenring,Reddit,"Perhaps you've seen it,maybe in a dream, a murky forgotten subreddit.A place where fake lore may mend your ailing mind . You will lose everything once hyped,the symbol of the curse,an augur of darkness.Your past. Your future. Your very light . None will have a meaning and you won't even care.By then you will be something other than human. A thing that feeds on fake lore, a hollow. Long ago in a land far to the east,a great developer built a great game. I believe they called it Elden Ring . Perhaps you are familiar? No, how could you be. One day you will stand before its decrepit menu,without really knowing why. Like a moth drawn to a flame, your wings will burn in anguish,time after time, for that is your fate.

I find it fascinating that ubisoft and bethesda get shXXt on because of things like this but this attempt at an open world does not.obsession with giant enemies. bigger means better and playing poke-poke-roll with a  pair of unwashed ankles is fun.buy on sale, I'm glad I did.",NEGATIVE,May 4,Not Recommended
